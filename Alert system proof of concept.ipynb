The incidence and carrier frequency of infantile TSD were found to be increased among French Canadians in specific areas of the province of Quebec or calculated from New England populations with French-Canadian heritage. No accurate infantile TSD carrier frequency for the whole French-Canadian population in Quebec has been published. In this study, we estimate the incidence and carrier frequency of infantile TSD in the Quebec French-Canadian population. The number of TSD cases was ascertained during the 1992-2015 period, as well as the number of births to mothers whose language of use is French. Seven cases of TSD have been diagnosed in Quebec during the period of ascertainment. This corresponds to an incidence of 1/218,144, which in turn corresponds to a carrier frequency of 1/234. In the same 24-year period, there are two French-Canadian couples who had a fetus prenatally diagnosed with TSD. If these cases are included, the incidence of TSD in the French-Canadian population of Quebec is 1/169,668 and the carrier frequency 1/206. These findings can be used for genetic counseling and policy decisions regarding carrier screening for TSD in populations of French-Canadian descent.</td>\n",

To date, only one case indicating the association between Tay-Sachs disease and central precocious puberty has been reported. Although the mechanism of this association is not clear, it is thought to be due to ganglioside accumulation in the central nervous system or the inhibition of the hypothalamic inhibiting pathway. Herein, we report two patients with genetically proven Tay-Sachs disease who developed central precocious puberty during follow-up. Pubertal development in patients affected by Tay-Sachs disease should be carefully assessed.</td>\n",

Infantile TSD is a devastating and fetal neurodegenerative disease with death before the age of 3-5 years. A small proportion of TSD patients carry milder mutations and may present juvenile or adult onset milder disease. TSD is more prevalent among Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) individuals and some other genetically isolated populations with carrier frequencies of approximately ~1:27 which is much higher than that of 1:300 in the general population. Carrier screening and prenatal testing for TSD are effective in preventing the birth of affected fetuses greatly diminishing the incidence of TSD. Testing of targeted HEXA mutations by genotyping or sequencing can detect 98% of carriers in AJ individuals; however, the detection rate is much lower for most other ethnic groups. When combined with enzyme analysis, above 98% of carriers can be reliably identified regardless of ethnic background. Multiplex PCR followed by allele-specific primer extension is one method to test for known and common mutations. Sanger sequencing or other sequencing methods are useful to identify private mutations. For prenatal testing, only predefined parental mutations need to be tested. In the event of unknown mutational status or the presence of variants of unknown significance (VUS), enzyme analysis must be performed in conjunction with DNA-based assays to enhance the diagnostic accuracy. Enzymatic assays involve the use of synthetic substrates 4-methylumbelliferyl-N-acetyl-β-glucosamine (4-MUG) and 4-methylumbelliferyl-6-sulfo-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-β-D-glucopyranoside (4-MUGS) to measure the percentage Hex A activity (Hex A%) and specific Hex A activity respectively.

Tay-Sachs patients with the infantile form do not live beyond 2-4 years of age due to rapid, progressive neurodegeneration. Enzyme replacement therapy is not a therapeutic option due to its inability to cross the blood-brain barrier. As an alternative, small molecules identified from high-throughput screening could provide leads suitable for chemical optimization to target the central nervous system. We developed a new high-throughput phenotypic assay utilizing infantile Tay-Sachs patient cells based on disrupted lysosomal calcium signaling as a monitor of diseased phenotype. The assay was validated in a pilot screen on a collection of Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs to identify compounds that could reverse or attenuate the disease. Pyrimethamine, a known pharmacological chaperone of β-hexosaminidase A, was identified from the primary screen. The mechanism of action of pyrimethamine in reversing the defective lysosomal phenotype was by improving autophagy. This new high-throughput screening assay in patient cells will enable the screening of larger chemical compound collections.

The late-onset form of disease (LOTS) is considered rare, and only a limited number of cases have been reported. The clinical course of LOTS differs substantially from classic infantile TSD. METHODS:Comprehensive data from 14 Czech patients with LOTS were collated, including results of enzyme assays and genetic analyses. RESULTS:14 patients (9 females, 5 males) with LOTS were diagnosed between 2002 and 2018 in the Czech Republic (a calculated birth prevalence of 1 per 325,175 live births). The median age of first symptoms was 21 years (range 10-33 years), and the median diagnostic delay was 10.5 years (range 0-29 years). The main clinical symptoms at the time of manifestation were stammering or slurred speech, proximal weakness of the lower extremities due to anterior horn cell neuronopathy, signs of neo- and paleocerebellar dysfunction and/or psychiatric disorders. Cerebellar atrophy detected through brain MRI was a common finding. Residual enzyme activity was 1.8-4.1% of controls. All patients carried the typical LOTS-associated c.805G&gt;A (p.Gly269Ser) mutation on at least one allele, while a novel point mutation, c.754C&gt;T (p.Arg252Cys) was found in two siblings. CONCLUSION:LOTS seems to be an underdiagnosed cause of progressive distal motor neuron disease, with variably expressed cerebellar impairment and psychiatric symptomatology in our group of adolescent and adult patients. The enzyme assay of β-hexosaminidase A in serum/plasma is a rapid and reliable tool to verify clinical suspicions.</td>\n",

Here, we have characterized 34 enzymatically confirmed TSD families to investigate the presence of novel as well as known variants in HEXA gene. Overall study detected 25 variants belonging to 31 affected TSD patients and 3 carrier couples confirmed by enzyme study. Of these 17 patients harbors 15 novel variants, including seven missense variants [p.V206L, p.Y213H, p.R252C, p.F257S, p.C328G, p.G454R, and p.P475R], four nonsense variant [p.S9X, p.E91X, p.W420X, and p.W482X], two splice site variants [c.347-1G&gt;A and c.460-1G&gt;A], and two small deletion [c.1349delC (p.A450VfsX3) and c.52delG (p.G18Dfs*82)].

A minority of patients have a late-onset form of disease that presents from late-childhood to adulthood and has a slowly progressive course with prolonged survival. Little research has been published documenting patient experiences with late-onset Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff diseases and how the disease impacts their daily lives and functioning. This study explored the most frequent symptoms and functional impacts experienced by patients with late-onset GM2 gangliosidosis through interviews with patients and caregivers. METHODS:A qualitative research study design was employed, using three focus groups and 18 one-on-one interviews with patients who were recruited at the National Tay-Sachs and Allied Diseases Annual Family Conference. Transcripts were generated from the discussions, and patient quotes were analyzed using a content analysis approach. Concepts were aggregated into symptom and functional impacts, and the frequency of mention in the focus groups and individual interviews was calculated. KEY FINDINGS:Many of the frequently described symptoms [muscle weakness (n = 19, 95%), \"clumsy\" gait (n = 12, 60%), fatigue (n = 10, 50%)] and impacts [difficulty walking (n = 19, 95%), falling (n = 17, 85%), and climbing stairs (n = 16, 80%)] disclosed by patients and caregivers were similar to those previously reported in the literature. However, less frequently described symptoms such as gastrointestinal issues (n = 4, 20%) and coughing fits (n = 5, 25%) have been expanded upon. This study evaluated the immediate impact of these symptoms on the patients' lives to highlight the burden of these symptoms and the functional limitations on daily living activities, independence, and emotional well-being. The findings were used to develop a conceptual disease model that could serve as a foundation for patient-centered outcomes in clinical trials and provide insights to the medical community that may benefit patient care. CONCLUSIONS:This study contributes to the current understanding of symptoms associated with late-onset GM2 gangliosidosis, and further identifies the many consequences and impacts of the disease. These symptoms and impacts could be measured in clinical trials to examine the effects of novel treatments from the patient perspective.</td>\n",

To this end, we applied this HEXM subunit in our PS813 gene editing system to treat neonatal Sandhoff mice. Through AAV delivery of the CRISPR system, a promoterless HEXM cDNA will be integrated into the albumin safe harbor locus, and lysosomal enzyme will be expressed and secreted from edited hepatocytes. 4 months after the i.v. of AAV vectors, plasma MUGS and MUG activities reached up to 144- and 17-fold of wild-type levels (n = 10, p &lt; 0.0001), respectively. More importantly, MUGS and MUG activities in the brain also increased significantly compared with untreated Sandhoff mice (p &lt; 0.001). Further, HPLC-MS/MS analysis showed that GM2 gangliosides in multiple tissues, except the brain, of treated mice were reduced to normal levels. Rotarod analysis showed that coordination and motor memory of treated mice were improved (p &lt; 0.05).

Symptoms include extensive neurodegeneration and often result in death in infancy. We report an in silico study of 42 Hex A variants associated with the disease. Variants were separated into three groups according to the age of onset: infantile (n=28), juvenile (n=9) and adult (n=5). Protein stability, aggregation potential and the degree of conservation of residues were predicted using a range of in silico tools. We explored the relationship between these properties and the age of onset of TSD. There was no significant relationship between proteinstability and disease severity or between protein aggregation and disease severity. Infantile TSD had a significantly higher mean conservation score than nondisease associated variants. This was not seen in either juvenile or adult TSD. This study has established that the degree of residue conservation may be predictive of infantile TSD. It is possible that these more highly conserved residues are involved in trafficking of the protein to the lysosome. In addition, we developed and validated software tools to automate the process of in silico analysis of proteins involved in inherited metabolic diseases.

Deficiency in HEXA results in accumulation of GM2 ganglioside, a glycosphingolipid, in lysosomes. Currently, there is no effective treatment for TSD. RESULTS:We generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from two TSD patient dermal fibroblast lines and further differentiated them into neural stem cells (NSCs). The TSD neural stem cells exhibited a disease phenotype of lysosomal lipid accumulation. The Tay-Sachs disease NSCs were then used to evaluate the therapeutic effects of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with recombinant human Hex A protein and two small molecular compounds: hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPβCD) and δ-tocopherol. Using this disease model, we observed reduction of lipid accumulation by employing enzyme replacement therapy as well as by the use of HPβCD and δ-tocopherol. CONCLUSION:Our results demonstrate that the Tay-Sachs disease NSCs possess the characteristic phenotype to serve as a cell-based disease model for study of the disease pathogenesis and evaluation of drug efficacy.

This disease is caused by β-hexosaminidase A (HexA) enzyme deficiency due to various mutations in α-subunit gene of this enzyme, resulting in GM2 ganglioside accumulation predominantly in lysosomes of nerve cells. Tay-Sachs disease is characterized by acute neurodegeneration preceded by activated microglia expansion, macrophage and astrocyte activation along with inflammatory mediator production. In most cases, the disease manifests itself during infancy, the \"infantile form,\" which characterizes the most severe disorders of the nervous system. The juvenile form, the symptoms of which appear in adolescence, and the most rare form with late onset of symptoms in adulthood are also described. The typical features of Tay-Sachs disease are muscle weakness, ataxia, speech, and mental disorders. Clinical symptom severity depends on residual HexA enzymatic activity associated with some mutations. Currently, Tay-Sachs disease treatment is based on symptom relief and, in case of the late-onset form, on the delay of progression. There are also clinical reports of substrate reduction therapy using miglustat and bone marrow or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. At the development stage there are methods of Tay-Sachs disease gene therapy using adeno- or adeno-associated viruses as vectors for the delivery of cDNA encoding α and β HexA subunit genes. Effectiveness of this approach is evaluated in α or β HexA subunit defective model mice or Jacob sheep, in which Tay-Sachs disease arises spontaneously and is characterized by the same pathological features as in humans.

Recent reports that progranulin (PGRN) functions as a chaperone of lysosomal enzymes and its deficiency is associated with LSDs, including Gaucher disease and neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, prompted us to screen the effects of recombinant PGRN on lysosomal storage in fibroblasts from 11 patients affected by various LSDs, which led to the isolation of TSD in which PGRN demonstrated the best effects in reducing lysosomal storage. Subsequent in vivo studies revealed significant GM2 accumulation and the existence of typical TSD cells containing zebra bodies in both aged and ovalbumin-challenged adult PGRN-deficient mice. In addition, HexA, but not HexB, was aggregated in PGRN-deficient cells. Furthermore, recombinant PGRN significantly reduced GM2 accumulation and lysosomal storage in these animal models. Mechanistic studies indicated that PGRN bound to HexA through granulins G and E domain and increased the enzymatic activity and lysosomal delivery of HexA. More importantly, Pcgin, an engineered PGRN derivative bearing the granulin E domain, also effectively bound to HexA and reduced the GM2 accumulation. Collectively, these studies not only provide new insights into the pathogenesis of TSD but may also have implications for developing PGRN-based therapy for this life-threatening disorder. KEY MESSAGES: GM2 accumulation and the existence of typical TSD cells containing zebra bodies are detected in both aged and ovalbumin-challenged adult PGRN deficient mice. Recombinant PGRN significantly reduces GM2 accumulation and lysosomal storage both in vivo and in vitro, which works through increasing the expression and lysosomal delivery of HexA.

Genetic counseling was provided to discuss the VUS and patients were offered hexosaminidase A (HEXA) blood enzyme testing to assist with VUS reclassification. To identify patient reactions and factors influencing their follow-up testing decisions after receiving these results, we conducted a retrospective quantitative study by administering online surveys to 62 patients with HEXA VUSs. Participants who pursued enzyme testing and those who did not both experienced low levels of distress when receiving the VUS results. Perceptions of HEXA carrier status after genetic counseling, decisional conflict levels, plans to have children in the near future, time available to pursue enzyme testing, and eligibility for research were significant factors influencing decision-making to pursue or not pursue enzyme testing. Genetic counseling played an important role in helping patients understand the VUS and follow-up testing options.

       "      <td>We discuss the assessment and differential diagnoses of a young adult Hungarian man with a 1-year history of a progressive and symmetric amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-like syndrome, along with irregular action tremor and stimulus-sensitive myoclonus of the arms. MR scan of the brain showed isolated cerebellar atrophy and formal neuropsychometric testing identified significant subclinical deficits in attention, processing speed and memory. We suspected a form of GM2 gangliosidosis, and white cell enzyme analysis showed markedly reduced enzymatic activity of β-hexosaminidase A. Genetic testing subsequently revealed two heterozygous pathogenic mutations in the HEXA gene (c.1499delT p.(Leu500fs) and c.805G&gt;A p.(Gly269Ser)), confirming the very rare diagnosis of adult-onset Tay-Sachs disease.</td>\n",

       "      <td>BACKGROUND:Pathogenic variants in HEXA that impair β-hexosaminidase A (Hex A) enzyme activity cause Tay-Sachs Disease (TSD), a severe autosomal-recessive neurodegenerative disorder. Hex A enzyme analysis demonstrates near-zero activity in patients affected with TSD and can also identify carriers, whose single functional copy of HEXA results in reduced enzyme activity relative to noncarriers. Although enzyme testing has been optimized and widely used for carrier screening in Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) individuals, it has unproven sensitivity and specificity in a pan-ethnic population. The ability to detect HEXA variants via DNA analysis has evolved from limited targeting of a few ethnicity-specific variants to next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the entire coding region coupled with interpretation of any discovered novel variants. METHODS:We combined results of enzyme testing, retrospective computational analysis, and variant reclassification to estimate the respective clinical performance of TSD screening via enzyme analysis and NGS. We maximized NGS accuracy by reclassifying variants of uncertain significance and compared to the maximum performance of enzyme analysis estimated by calculating ethnicity-specific frequencies of variants known to yield false-positive or false-negative enzyme results (e.g., pseudodeficiency and B1 alleles). RESULTS:In both AJ and non-AJ populations, the estimated clinical sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value were higher by NGS than by enzyme testing. The differences were significant for all comparisons except for AJ clinical sensitivity, where NGS exceeded enzyme testing, but not significantly. CONCLUSIONS:Our results suggest that performance of an NGS-based TSD carrier screen that interrogates the entire coding region and employs novel variant interpretation exceeds that of Hex A enzyme testing, warranting a reconsideration of existing guidelines.</td>\n",

       "0   Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) is a hereditary neurodegenerative condition inherited through an autosomal recessive pattern. The incidence and carrier frequency of infantile TSD were found to be increased among French Canadians in specific areas of the province of Quebec or calculated from New England populations with French-Canadian heritage. No accurate infantile TSD carrier frequency for the whole French-Canadian population in Quebec has been published. In this study, we estimate the incidence and carrier frequency of infantile TSD in the Quebec French-Canadian population. The number of TSD cases was ascertained during the 1992-2015 period, as well as the number of births to mothers whose language of use is French. Seven cases of TSD have been diagnosed in Quebec during the period of ascertainment. This corresponds to an incidence of 1/218,144, which in turn corresponds to a carrier frequency of 1/234. In the same 24-year period, there are two French-Canadian couples who had a fetus prenatally diagnosed with TSD. If these cases are included, the incidence of TSD in the French-Canadian population of Quebec is 1/169,668 and the carrier frequency 1/206. These findings can be used for genetic counseling and policy decisions regarding carrier screening for TSD in populations of French-Canadian descent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "1   Tay-Sachs disease is an autosomal recessive type of lysosomal storage disorder. The disease is very rare in Turkey, with an incidence of 0.54/100,000. The clinical manifestations of Tay-Sachs disease include progressive developmental delay, seizures, deafness, blindness, spasticity, and dystonia, which are caused by the accumulation of gangliosides in the central nervous system. To date, only one case indicating the association between Tay-Sachs disease and central precocious puberty has been reported. Although the mechanism of this association is not clear, it is thought to be due to ganglioside accumulation in the central nervous system or the inhibition of the hypothalamic inhibiting pathway. Herein, we report two patients with genetically proven Tay-Sachs disease who developed central precocious puberty during follow-up. Pubertal development in patients affected by Tay-Sachs disease should be carefully assessed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "2   Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations of the HEXA gene resulting in the deficiency of hexosaminidase A (Hex A) and subsequent neuronal accumulation of GM2 gangliosides. Infantile TSD is a devastating and fetal neurodegenerative disease with death before the age of 3-5 years. A small proportion of TSD patients carry milder mutations and may present juvenile or adult onset milder disease. TSD is more prevalent among Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) individuals and some other genetically isolated populations with carrier frequencies of approximately ~1:27 which is much higher than that of 1:300 in the general population. Carrier screening and prenatal testing for TSD are effective in preventing the birth of affected fetuses greatly diminishing the incidence of TSD. Testing of targeted HEXA mutations by genotyping or sequencing can detect 98% of carriers in AJ individuals; however, the detection rate is much lower for most other ethnic groups. When combined with enzyme analysis, above 98% of carriers can be reliably identified regardless of ethnic background. Multiplex PCR followed by allele-specific primer extension is one method to test for known and common mutations. Sanger sequencing or other sequencing methods are useful to identify private mutations. For prenatal testing, only predefined parental mutations need to be tested. In the event of unknown mutational status or the presence of variants of unknown significance (VUS), enzyme analysis must be performed in conjunction with DNA-based assays to enhance the diagnostic accuracy. Enzymatic assays involve the use of synthetic substrates 4-methylumbelliferyl-N-acetyl-β-glucosamine (4-MUG) and 4-methylumbelliferyl-6-sulfo-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-β-D-glucopyranoside (4-MUGS) to measure the percentage Hex A activity (Hex A%) and specific Hex A activity respectively. These biochemical and molecular tests can be performed in both direct specimens and cultured cells from chorionic villi sampling or amniocentesis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "3   Tay-Sachs disease is an inherited lysosomal storage disease resulting from mutations in the lysosomal enzyme, β-hexosaminidase A, and leads to excessive accumulation of GM2 ganglioside. Tay-Sachs patients with the infantile form do not live beyond 2-4 years of age due to rapid, progressive neurodegeneration. Enzyme replacement therapy is not a therapeutic option due to its inability to cross the blood-brain barrier. As an alternative, small molecules identified from high-throughput screening could provide leads suitable for chemical optimization to target the central nervous system. We developed a new high-throughput phenotypic assay utilizing infantile Tay-Sachs patient cells based on disrupted lysosomal calcium signaling as a monitor of diseased phenotype. The assay was validated in a pilot screen on a collection of Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs to identify compounds that could reverse or attenuate the disease. Pyrimethamine, a known pharmacological chaperone of β-hexosaminidase A, was identified from the primary screen. The mechanism of action of pyrimethamine in reversing the defective lysosomal phenotype was by improving autophagy. This new high-throughput screening assay in patient cells will enable the screening of larger chemical compound collections. Importantly, this approach could lead to identification of new molecular targets previously unknown to impact the disease and accelerate the discovery of new treatments for Tay-Sachs disease.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "4   BACKGROUND:Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by a lysosomal β-hexosaminidase A deficiency due to mutations in the HEXA gene. The late-onset form of disease (LOTS) is considered rare, and only a limited number of cases have been reported. The clinical course of LOTS differs substantially from classic infantile TSD. METHODS:Comprehensive data from 14 Czech patients with LOTS were collated, including results of enzyme assays and genetic analyses. RESULTS:14 patients (9 females, 5 males) with LOTS were diagnosed between 2002 and 2018 in the Czech Republic (a calculated birth prevalence of 1 per 325,175 live births). The median age of first symptoms was 21 years (range 10-33 years), and the median diagnostic delay was 10.5 years (range 0-29 years). The main clinical symptoms at the time of manifestation were stammering or slurred speech, proximal weakness of the lower extremities due to anterior horn cell neuronopathy, signs of neo- and paleocerebellar dysfunction and/or psychiatric disorders. Cerebellar atrophy detected through brain MRI was a common finding. Residual enzyme activity was 1.8-4.1% of controls. All patients carried the typical LOTS-associated c.805G>A (p.Gly269Ser) mutation on at least one allele, while a novel point mutation, c.754C>T (p.Arg252Cys) was found in two siblings. CONCLUSION:LOTS seems to be an underdiagnosed cause of progressive distal motor neuron disease, with variably expressed cerebellar impairment and psychiatric symptomatology in our group of adolescent and adult patients. The enzyme assay of β-hexosaminidase A in serum/plasma is a rapid and reliable tool to verify clinical suspicions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "5   Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) is a GM2 gangliosidosis lysosomal storage disease caused by a loss of lysosomal hexosaminidase-A (HEXA) activity and characterized by progressive neurodegeneration due to the massive accumulation of GM2 ganglioside in the brain. Here, we generated iPSCs derived from patients with TSD, and found similar potential for neural differentiation between TSD-iPSCs and normal iPSCs, although neural progenitor cells (NPCs) derived from the TSD-iPSCs exhibited enlarged lysosomes and upregulation of the lysosomal marker, LAMP1, caused by the accumulation of GM2 ganglioside. The NPCs derived from TSD-iPSCs also had an increased incidence of oxidative stress-induced cell death. TSD-iPSC-derived neurons showed a decrease in exocytotic activity with the accumulation of GM2 ganglioside, suggesting deficient neurotransmission in TSD. Our findings demonstrated that NPCs and mature neurons derived from TSD-iPSCs are potentially useful cellular models of TSD and are useful for investigating the efficacy of drug candidates in the future.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "6   Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) (OMIM) is a neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorder caused due to mutations in the HEXA gene. To date, nearly 190 mutations have been reported in HEXA gene. Here, we have characterized 34 enzymatically confirmed TSD families to investigate the presence of novel as well as known variants in HEXA gene. Overall study detected 25 variants belonging to 31 affected TSD patients and 3 carrier couples confirmed by enzyme study. Of these 17 patients harbors 15 novel variants, including seven missense variants [p.V206L, p.Y213H, p.R252C, p.F257S, p.C328G, p.G454R, and p.P475R], four nonsense variant [p.S9X, p.E91X, p.W420X, and p.W482X], two splice site variants [c.347-1G>A and c.460-1G>A], and two small deletion [c.1349delC (p.A450VfsX3) and c.52delG (p.G18Dfs*82)]. While remaining 17 patients harbors 10 previously reported variants that includes six missense variants [p.M1T, p.R170Q, p.D322Y, p.D322N, p.E462V, and p.R499C], one nonsense variant [p.Q106X], two splice site variants [c.1073+1G>A and c.459+4A>G] and one 4 bp insertion [c.1278insTATC (p.Y427IfsX5)]. In conclusion, Indian infantile TSD patients provide newer insight into the molecular heterogeneity of the TSD. Combining present study and our earlier studies, we have observed that 67% genotypes found in Indian TSD patients are novel, which are associated with severe infantile phenotypes, while rest 33% genotypes found in our cohort were previously reported in various populations. In addition, higher frequency of the p.E462V and c.1278insTATC mutations in the present study further support and suggest the prevalence of p.E462V mutation in the Indian population.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "7   BACKGROUND:The GM2 gangliosidoses (GM2), Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff diseases, are rare, autosomal recessive genetic disorders caused by mutations in the lysosomal enzyme β-hexosaminidase A (HEXA) or β-hexosaminidase B (HEXB) genes, respectively. A minority of patients have a late-onset form of disease that presents from late-childhood to adulthood and has a slowly progressive course with prolonged survival. Little research has been published documenting patient experiences with late-onset Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff diseases and how the disease impacts their daily lives and functioning. This study explored the most frequent symptoms and functional impacts experienced by patients with late-onset GM2 gangliosidosis through interviews with patients and caregivers. METHODS:A qualitative research study design was employed, using three focus groups and 18 one-on-one interviews with patients who were recruited at the National Tay-Sachs and Allied Diseases Annual Family Conference. Transcripts were generated from the discussions, and patient quotes were analyzed using a content analysis approach. Concepts were aggregated into symptom and functional impacts, and the frequency of mention in the focus groups and individual interviews was calculated. KEY FINDINGS:Many of the frequently described symptoms [muscle weakness (n = 19, 95%), \"clumsy\" gait (n = 12, 60%), fatigue (n = 10, 50%)] and impacts [difficulty walking (n = 19, 95%), falling (n = 17, 85%), and climbing stairs (n = 16, 80%)] disclosed by patients and caregivers were similar to those previously reported in the literature. However, less frequently described symptoms such as gastrointestinal issues (n = 4, 20%) and coughing fits (n = 5, 25%) have been expanded upon. This study evaluated the immediate impact of these symptoms on the patients' lives to highlight the burden of these symptoms and the functional limitations on daily living activities, independence, and emotional well-being. The findings were used to develop a conceptual disease model that could serve as a foundation for patient-centered outcomes in clinical trials and provide insights to the medical community that may benefit patient care. CONCLUSIONS:This study contributes to the current understanding of symptoms associated with late-onset GM2 gangliosidosis, and further identifies the many consequences and impacts of the disease. These symptoms and impacts could be measured in clinical trials to examine the effects of novel treatments from the patient perspective.   \n",
       "8   Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) is a type 1 gangliosidosis (GM2) and caused by hexosaminidase A deficiency resulting in abnormal sphingolipid metabolism and deposition of precursors in different organs. It is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder transmitted in an autosomal-recessive manner. There is an accumulation of GM2 in neurocytes and retinal ganglions which result in progressive loss of neurological function and formation of the cherry-red spot which is the hallmark of TSD. We report the first case of juvenile TSD from Pakistan in a child with death of an older sibling without the diagnosis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "9   The GM2-gangliosidoses are neurological diseases causing premature death, thus developing effective treatment protocols is urgent. GM2-gangliosidoses result from deficiency of a lysosomal enzyme β-hexosaminidase (Hex) and subsequent accumulation of GM2 gangliosides. Genetic changes in HEXA, encoding the Hex α subunit, or HEXB, encoding the Hex β subunit, causes Tay-Sachs disease and Sandhoff disease, respectively. Previous studies have showed that a modified human Hex µ subunit (HEXM) can treat both Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff diseases by forming a homodimer to degrade GM2 gangliosides. To this end, we applied this HEXM subunit in our PS813 gene editing system to treat neonatal Sandhoff mice. Through AAV delivery of the CRISPR system, a promoterless HEXM cDNA will be integrated into the albumin safe harbor locus, and lysosomal enzyme will be expressed and secreted from edited hepatocytes. 4 months after the i.v. of AAV vectors, plasma MUGS and MUG activities reached up to 144- and 17-fold of wild-type levels (n = 10, p < 0.0001), respectively. More importantly, MUGS and MUG activities in the brain also increased significantly compared with untreated Sandhoff mice (p < 0.001). Further, HPLC-MS/MS analysis showed that GM2 gangliosides in multiple tissues, except the brain, of treated mice were reduced to normal levels. Rotarod analysis showed that coordination and motor memory of treated mice were improved (p < 0.05). Histological analysis of H&E stained tissues showed reduced cellular vacuolation in the brain and liver of treated Sandhoff mice. These results demonstrate the potential of developing a treatment of in vivo genome editing for Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff patients.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "10  Tay-Sachs disease (TSD), a deficiency of b-hexosaminidase A (Hex A), is a rare but debilitating hereditary metabolic disorder. Symptoms include extensive neurodegeneration and often result in death in infancy. We report an in silico study of 42 Hex A variants associated with the disease. Variants were separated into three groups according to the age of onset: infantile (n=28), juvenile (n=9) and adult (n=5). Protein stability, aggregation potential and the degree of conservation of residues were predicted using a range of in silico tools. We explored the relationship between these properties and the age of onset of TSD. There was no significant relationship between proteinstability and disease severity or between protein aggregation and disease severity. Infantile TSD had a significantly higher mean conservation score than nondisease associated variants. This was not seen in either juvenile or adult TSD. This study has established that the degree of residue conservation may be predictive of infantile TSD. It is possible that these more highly conserved residues are involved in trafficking of the protein to the lysosome. In addition, we developed and validated software tools to automate the process of in silico analysis of proteins involved in inherited metabolic diseases. Further work is required to identify the function of well-conserved residues to establish an in silico predictive model of TSD severity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

       "12  BACKGROUND:Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder caused by autosomal recessive mutations in the HEXA gene on chromosome 15 that encodes β-hexosaminidase. Deficiency in HEXA results in accumulation of GM2 ganglioside, a glycosphingolipid, in lysosomes. Currently, there is no effective treatment for TSD. RESULTS:We generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from two TSD patient dermal fibroblast lines and further differentiated them into neural stem cells (NSCs). The TSD neural stem cells exhibited a disease phenotype of lysosomal lipid accumulation. The Tay-Sachs disease NSCs were then used to evaluate the therapeutic effects of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with recombinant human Hex A protein and two small molecular compounds: hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPβCD) and δ-tocopherol. Using this disease model, we observed reduction of lipid accumulation by employing enzyme replacement therapy as well as by the use of HPβCD and δ-tocopherol. CONCLUSION:Our results demonstrate that the Tay-Sachs disease NSCs possess the characteristic phenotype to serve as a cell-based disease model for study of the disease pathogenesis and evaluation of drug efficacy. The enzyme replacement therapy with recombinant Hex A protein and two small molecules (cyclodextrin and tocopherol) significantly ameliorated lipid accumulation in the Tay-Sachs disease cell model.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "13  Tay-Sachs disease belongs to the group of autosomal-recessive lysosomal storage metabolic disorders. This disease is caused by β-hexosaminidase A (HexA) enzyme deficiency due to various mutations in α-subunit gene of this enzyme, resulting in GM2 ganglioside accumulation predominantly in lysosomes of nerve cells. Tay-Sachs disease is characterized by acute neurodegeneration preceded by activated microglia expansion, macrophage and astrocyte activation along with inflammatory mediator production. In most cases, the disease manifests itself during infancy, the \"infantile form,\" which characterizes the most severe disorders of the nervous system. The juvenile form, the symptoms of which appear in adolescence, and the most rare form with late onset of symptoms in adulthood are also described. The typical features of Tay-Sachs disease are muscle weakness, ataxia, speech, and mental disorders. Clinical symptom severity depends on residual HexA enzymatic activity associated with some mutations. Currently, Tay-Sachs disease treatment is based on symptom relief and, in case of the late-onset form, on the delay of progression. There are also clinical reports of substrate reduction therapy using miglustat and bone marrow or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. At the development stage there are methods of Tay-Sachs disease gene therapy using adeno- or adeno-associated viruses as vectors for the delivery of cDNA encoding α and β HexA subunit genes. Effectiveness of this approach is evaluated in α or β HexA subunit defective model mice or Jacob sheep, in which Tay-Sachs disease arises spontaneously and is characterized by the same pathological features as in humans. This review discusses the possibilities of new therapeutic strategies in Tay-Sachs disease therapy aimed at preventing neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "14  Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) is a lethal lysosomal storage disease (LSD) caused by mutations in the HexA gene, which can lead to deficiency of β-hexosaminidase A (HexA) activity and consequent accumulation of its substrate, GM2 ganglioside. Recent reports that progranulin (PGRN) functions as a chaperone of lysosomal enzymes and its deficiency is associated with LSDs, including Gaucher disease and neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, prompted us to screen the effects of recombinant PGRN on lysosomal storage in fibroblasts from 11 patients affected by various LSDs, which led to the isolation of TSD in which PGRN demonstrated the best effects in reducing lysosomal storage. Subsequent in vivo studies revealed significant GM2 accumulation and the existence of typical TSD cells containing zebra bodies in both aged and ovalbumin-challenged adult PGRN-deficient mice. In addition, HexA, but not HexB, was aggregated in PGRN-deficient cells. Furthermore, recombinant PGRN significantly reduced GM2 accumulation and lysosomal storage in these animal models. Mechanistic studies indicated that PGRN bound to HexA through granulins G and E domain and increased the enzymatic activity and lysosomal delivery of HexA. More importantly, Pcgin, an engineered PGRN derivative bearing the granulin E domain, also effectively bound to HexA and reduced the GM2 accumulation. Collectively, these studies not only provide new insights into the pathogenesis of TSD but may also have implications for developing PGRN-based therapy for this life-threatening disorder. KEY MESSAGES: GM2 accumulation and the existence of typical TSD cells containing zebra bodies are detected in both aged and ovalbumin-challenged adult PGRN deficient mice. Recombinant PGRN significantly reduces GM2 accumulation and lysosomal storage both in vivo and in vitro, which works through increasing the expression and lysosomal delivery of HexA. Pcgin, an engineered PGRN derivative bearing the granulin E domain, also effectively binds to to HexA and reduces GM2 accumulation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "15  JScreen is a national public health initiative based out of Emory University that provides reproductive carrier screening through an online portal and follow-up genetic counseling services. In 2014, JScreen began reporting to patients variants of uncertain significance (VUSs) in the gene that causes Tay-Sachs disease (HEXA). Genetic counseling was provided to discuss the VUS and patients were offered hexosaminidase A (HEXA) blood enzyme testing to assist with VUS reclassification. To identify patient reactions and factors influencing their follow-up testing decisions after receiving these results, we conducted a retrospective quantitative study by administering online surveys to 62 patients with HEXA VUSs. Participants who pursued enzyme testing and those who did not both experienced low levels of distress when receiving the VUS results. Perceptions of HEXA carrier status after genetic counseling, decisional conflict levels, plans to have children in the near future, time available to pursue enzyme testing, and eligibility for research were significant factors influencing decision-making to pursue or not pursue enzyme testing. Genetic counseling played an important role in helping patients understand the VUS and follow-up testing options. When discussing VUSs with patients, it would be beneficial for genetic counselors to focus on the patient's perception of the VUS, anxiety related to the uncertainty of their results, and follow-up options, when available.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "16  Several genetic disorders are specific to Jewish heritage; one of the most devastating is Tay-Sachs disease.Tay-Sachs is a fatal hereditary disease, causing progressive neurological problems for which there is no cure. Ethical issues surrounding genetic testing for Tay-Sachs within the Jewish community continue to be complex and multifaceted. A perspective of Tay-Sachs, using rights-based ethics and virtue ethics as a theoretical framework, is explored.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

Genetic testing subsequently revealed two heterozygous pathogenic mutations in the HEXA gene (c.1499delT p.(Leu500fs) and c.805G>A p.(Gly269Ser)), confirming the very rare diagnosis of adult-onset Tay-Sachs disease.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "18  BACKGROUND:Pathogenic variants in HEXA that impair β-hexosaminidase A (Hex A) enzyme activity cause Tay-Sachs Disease (TSD), a severe autosomal-recessive neurodegenerative disorder. Hex A enzyme analysis demonstrates near-zero activity in patients affected with TSD and can also identify carriers, whose single functional copy of HEXA results in reduced enzyme activity relative to noncarriers. Although enzyme testing has been optimized and widely used for carrier screening in Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) individuals, it has unproven sensitivity and specificity in a pan-ethnic population. The ability to detect HEXA variants via DNA analysis has evolved from limited targeting of a few ethnicity-specific variants to next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the entire coding region coupled with interpretation of any discovered novel variants. METHODS:We combined results of enzyme testing, retrospective computational analysis, and variant reclassification to estimate the respective clinical performance of TSD screening via enzyme analysis and NGS. We maximized NGS accuracy by reclassifying variants of uncertain significance and compared to the maximum performance of enzyme analysis estimated by calculating ethnicity-specific frequencies of variants known to yield false-positive or false-negative enzyme results (e.g., pseudodeficiency and B1 alleles). RESULTS:In both AJ and non-AJ populations, the estimated clinical sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value were higher by NGS than by enzyme testing. The differences were significant for all comparisons except for AJ clinical sensitivity, where NGS exceeded enzyme testing, but not significantly. CONCLUSIONS:Our results suggest that performance of an NGS-based TSD carrier screen that interrogates the entire coding region and employs novel variant interpretation exceeds that of Hex A enzyme testing, warranting a reconsideration of existing guidelines.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

The present study aims to identify a circulating microRNA (miRNA) signature for TS patients with and without congenital heart disease (CHD). METHODS:Microarray platform interrogating 2549 miRNAs were used to detect the miRNA abundance levels in the blood of 33 TS patients and 14 age-matched healthy volunteer controls (HVs). The differentially abundant miRNAs between the two groups were further validated by RT-qPCR. RESULTS:We identified 60 differentially abundant miRNA in the blood of TS patients compared to HVs, from which, 41 and 19 miRNAs showed a higher and a lower abundance levels in TS patients compared to HVs, respectively. RT-qPCR confirmed the significantly higher abundance levels of eight miRNAs namely miR-374b-5p, miR-199a-5p, miR-340-3p, miR-125b-5p, miR-30e-3p, miR-126-3p, miR-5695, and miR-26b-5p in TS patients as compared with the HVs. The abundance level of miR-5695 was higher in TS patients displaying CHD as compared to TS patients without CHD (p = 0.0265; log2-fold change 1.99); whereas, the abundance level of miR-126-3p was lower in TS patients with congenital aortic valve disease (AVD) compared to TS patients without BAV (p = 0.0139, log2-fold change 1.52). The clinical feature statistics revealed that miR-126-3p had a significant correlation with sinotubular junction Z-score (r = 0.42; p = 0.0154). CONCLUSION:The identified circulating miRNAs signature for TS patients with manifestations associated with cardiovascular diseases provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of TS that may guide the development of novel diagnostic approaches.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Turner syndrome (TS) is associated with coronary artery disease (CAD), an important cause of premature death in TS. However, the determinants of CAD in women with TS remain unknown. In a cross-sectional study design, 168 women without clinical evidence of CAD (115 with TS and 53 without TS) were assessed for the presence and volume of subclinical CAD using coronary CT angiography. Karyotype, the presence of congenital heart defects and conventional cardiovascular risk factors were also registered. Comparative analyses were performed (1) between women with and without TS and (2) in the TS group, between women with and without subclinical CAD. The prevalence of CAD, in crude and adjusted analyses, was not increased for women with TS (crude prevalence: 40 [35%] in TS vs. 25 [47%] in controls, p = 0.12). The volume of atherosclerosis was not higher in women with TS compared with controls (median and interquartile range 0 [0-92] in TS vs. 0 [0-81]mm3 in controls, p = 0.29). Among women with TS, women with subclinical CAD were older (46 ± 13 vs. 37 ± 11 years, p &lt; 0.001), had higher blood pressure (systolic blood pressure 129 ± 16 vs. 121 ± 16 mmHg, p &lt; 0.05) and were more frequently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes (5 [13%] vs. 2 [3%], p &lt; 0.05). Karyotype or congenital heart defects were not associated with subclinical CAD. Some women with TS show early signs of CAD, however overall, not more than women without TS. Conventional cardiovascular risk factors were the principal determinants of CAD also in TS, and CAD prevention strategies should be observed.ClinicalTrial.gov Identifier: NCT01678261 ( https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01678261 ).</td>\n",

Despite this, studies have yet to evaluate how deficits translate into and are compensated for in academic settings. This study seeks to explore cognitive functioning, as well as the accessibility and development of academic accommodations in females with Turner syndrome from adolescence to adulthood. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study took place at the National Institutes of Health. Females with Turner syndrome (age range: 10-68; n = 142) were evaluated on need for and procurement of academic accommodations. Cognitive functioning was evaluated in participants aged 20 years and older (n = 101), as per the age validation of the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, one-sample comparisons, and analyses of variance. Results: Females with Turner syndrome scored significantly lower than the normative population on visuospatial (p &lt; 0.001), delayed memory (p &lt; 0.001), and overall (p &lt; 0.001) functioning. About 25.9% of participants reported that accommodations were not needed, despite displaying one or more cognitive deficits. Approximately 12.7% reported needing but not receiving accommodations, however, this is only reported by females 30 years and older; no females aged 10-29 years indicated this discrepancy. Conclusions: Findings suggest that procurement of academic accommodations has increased within recent decades. Still, there is a discrepancy between those displaying cognitive deficits and those receiving academic accommodations. We highlight frequently received accommodations so that students and professionals can target deficits with appropriate accommodations.</td>\n",

       "      <td>BACKGROUND:Turner syndrome (TS) occurs in approximately 1 in 2500 live female births and is caused by the partial or complete loss of one of the X chromosomes, resulting in abnormalities such as ovarian failure and infertility. However, pregnancy in women with TS may still occur via spontaneous pregnancy or through oocyte donation. Limited data exists on pregnancy in women with TS that could aid in clinical care. METHODS:We conducted a population-based cross-sectional study using data from the Discharge Abstract Database (2004-2015), which contains all labor and delivery hospitalizations across Canada (excluding Quebec) where women delivered a live or stillborn infant. The odds of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes for women with and without TS were calculated using backwards multivariable logistic regression with generalized estimating equations, adjusting for the Obstetric Comorbidity Index, mode of delivery, and year. RESULTS:Overall, 2,682,284 women delivered a live or stillborn infant during the study period and 44 birth events occurred for women with TS. No severe maternal morbidity or adverse cardiovascular events occurred for women with TS at their labor and delivery hospitalization. However, infants born to women with TS were 3.6 times more likely (95% CI: 1.7-7.8) to experience neonatal morbidity than those born to women without TS. These infants also were more likely to have had a preterm birth (aOR: 2.9, 95% CI: 1.6-5.4) and to be small-for-gestational-age (aOR: 4.5, 95% CI: 2.4-8.4). CONCLUSION:This study adds further understanding of the likelihood of adverse outcomes for pregnant women with TS.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Turner syndrome (TS) is a genetic disorder affecting approximately 1:2000 live-born females. It results from partial or complete X monosomy and is associated with a range of clinical issues including a unique cognitive profile and increased risk for certain behavioral problems. Structural neuroimaging studies in adolescents, adults, and older children with TS have revealed altered neuroanatomy but are unable to identify when in development differences arise. In addition, older children and adults have often been exposed to years of growth hormone and/or exogenous estrogen therapy with potential implications for neurodevelopment. The study presented here is the first to test whether brain structure is altered in infants with TS. Twenty-six infants with TS received high-resolution structural MRI scans of the brain at 1 year of age and were compared to 47 typically developing female and 39 typically developing male infants. Results indicate that the typical neuroanatomical profile seen in older individuals with TS, characterized by decreased gray matter volumes in premotor, somatosensory, and parietal-occipital cortex, is already present at 1 year of age, suggesting a stable phenotype with origins in the prenatal or early postnatal period.</td>\n",

In this study, we explore the phenotype of TS in diverse populations using clinical examination and facial analysis technology. Clinical data from 78 individuals and images from 108 individuals with TS from 19 different countries were analyzed. Individuals were grouped into categories of African descent (African), Asian, Latin American, Caucasian (European descent), and Middle Eastern. The most common phenotype features across all population groups were short stature (86%), cubitus valgus (76%), and low posterior hairline 70%. Two facial analysis technology experiments were conducted: TS versus general population and TS versus Noonan syndrome. Across all ethnicities, facial analysis was accurate in diagnosing TS from frontal facial images as measured by the area under the curve (AUC). An AUC of 0.903 (p &lt; .001) was found for TS versus general population controls and 0.925 (p &lt; .001) for TS versus individuals with Noonan syndrome. In summary, we present consistent clinical findings from global populations with TS and additionally demonstrate that facial analysis technology can accurately distinguish TS from the general population and Noonan syndrome.</td>\n",

Females with Turner syndrome are characterized by skeletal abnormalities, short stature and primary ovarian insufficiency. The aim of this narrative review was to identify the underlying mechanisms of osteoporosis in Turner syndrome, summarize its clinical manifestations and provide suggestions regarding the management of osteoporosis. Girls and women with Turner syndrome have lower bone mineral density and a higher fracture rate than healthy individuals. The most important risk factors for osteoporosis are inadequately treated primary ovarian insufficiency, followed by intrinsic bone abnormalities. Comorbidities that further increase the risk of osteoporosis include vitamin D deficiency, celiac disease and inflammatory bowel disease. In addition, hearing problems can predispose to falls. Early initiation of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) at the age of 11-13 years, prompt titration to the adult dose after 2 years and long-term follow-up to ensure compliance with HRT are the cornerstones of osteoporosis prevention in women with Turner syndrome.</td>\n",

It has been extensively reviewed in the medical literature, yet little has been discussed regarding the skeletal manifestations that present to the orthopaedic surgeon. It is important for the orthopaedic surgeon to be familiar with the clinical findings and comorbid conditions in Turner syndrome because they may be the first line of diagnosis when a patient presents for short stature, scoliosis, or slipped capital femoral epiphysis. Recent studies have identified the short stature homeobox gene as the main cause of the skeletal differences in patients with Turner syndrome, affecting longitudinal bone growth. Skeletal deformities including short stature, delayed skeletal maturation, angular deformity of the limbs, spinal deformity, and early-onset osteoporosis have been associated with Turner syndrome. This article will review the skeletal manifestations of Turner syndrome and propose guidelines for the treatment and monitoring of these patients. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE:: Level V.</td>\n",

ASH effectively improved the adult height (AH) of TS patients without spontaneous puberty but decreased the AH of TS patients with spontaneous puberty. Although GH therapy for TS was approved in 1991, the approved dosage remained 0.5 IU/kg/wk for GH-deficient TS patients and improved AH by approximately 7 cm. However, AH did not reach -2 standard deviations in healthy girls. In 1999, the requirement of GH deficiency was removed and a dose of 1.0 IU/kg/wk was approved. Although an increase in AH was expected, no reports showed significant improvements in AH at a high dose of GH. GH + ASH combination therapy was reevaluated and recommended for TS patients with gonadal failure and an extremely short stature or those who respond poorly to GH therapy. Although early estrogen replacement therapy is recommended to improve psychological quality of life and prevent osteoporosis, it lowered AH even at a low dose of ethinyl estradiol (25 ng/kg/d). The initiation of ethynyl estradiol at an extremely low dose (1-5 ng/kg/d) at a relatively young age successfully improved AH.</td>\n",

On the other hand, it is known that obesity is associated with increased serum levels of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs: valine; leucine and isoleucine) and aromatic amino acids. The aim of the study is to compare the metabolic fingerprint of girls with TS to the metabolic fingerprint of girls with obesity. Metabolic fingerprinting using an untargeted metabolomic approach was examined in plasma from 46 girls with TS (study group) and 22 age-matched girls with obesity (control group). The mean values of BCAAs, methionine, phenylalanine, lysine, tryptophan, histidine, tyrosine, alanine and ornithine were significantly lower in the study group than in the control (p from 0.0025 to &lt;0.000001). Strong significant correlation between BCAAs, phenylalanine, arginine, tyrosine, glutamic acid, citrulline and alanine, and body mass index expressed as standard deviation score BMI-SDS in the patients with obesity (p from 0.049 to 0.0005) was found. In contrast; there was no correlation between these amino acids and BMI-SDS in the girls with TS.

This study aimed to investigate clinical features and identify associated abnormalities in a group of patients with TS. METHODS:Retrospective data of presenting clinical features collected from the medical records of the 37 patients with TS. All patients were examined for associated clinical abnormalities. RESULTS:Mean age at diagnosis was 9.3±4.1 years. The main reason for referral was short stature and/or delayed puberty. All of the patients had at least one dysmorphic sign. Skeletal system abnormalities (57%) were the most common associated abnormality, which was followed by gastrointestinal system problems (40%). Cardiac defects occurred in 32%. Urinary system abnormalities occurred in 27%. Dermatological problems were detected in 32% of the patients. The pathology of the hearing was found in 19%. Autoimmune thyroid disease was detected in 24% of the patients, and celiac disease was detected in 5.4% of the patients.

The aim of this paper is to show the characteristics of TS patients treated at our Clinic, with an emphasis on their age at diagnosis and the effect of growth hormone therapy on their final height and height gain. METHODS:This retrospective study is based on the medical records of 37 female pediatric patients aged 0-18 years treated at the Pediatric Department of the Sestre milosrdnice University Hospital Center from 1997 to 2017. RESULTS:Mean age at diagnosis is 7.55 ±5.13 years. In the observed period a trend towards later diagnosis was shown (p=0.004). Most patients (26) were treated with rhGH. The average height of all patients who reached their final height (n=30) was 151.49 ±6.49 cm (SDS -1.73 ±1.11). The initial height SDS was significantly lower in the treated compared to the untreated patients (p=0.02). The final height was 151.59 ±7.21 cm (SDS -1.72 ±1.3) in the treated and 151.12 ±5.85 cm (SDS -1.77 ±0.94) in the untreated patients. The difference between the initial and final height was significantly greater in the treated patients compared to the untreated patients (30.46 and 16.28 cm, p=0.039). The same was true for the difference between the initial and final height SDS (0.78, or -0.3, p=0.042). CONCLUSIONS:Based on the results of this research, TS is increasingly diagnosed at a later age. The effect of rhGH therapy was favorable and resulted in a greater height gain in the treated patients.</td>\n",

However, with advances in fertility therapy, more women with TS are contemplating pregnancy. This study compared rates of adverse cardiovascular (CV) outcomes among: (1) pregnant and non-pregnant women with TS and (2) pregnant women with TS with/without structural heart disease. METHODS:Retrospective analysis of pregnant and age-matched non-pregnant controls with TS (2005-2017) across 10 CV centres was done. Data were collected at initial evaluation in pregnancy and outcomes were assessed to 6 months postpartum. Adverse CV events were defined as CV death, aortic dissection/rupture and/or aortic intervention. Non-pregnant age-matched controls were followed over the same time period. RESULTS:Sixty-eight pregnancies were included (60 women, mean age 33 years, 48% primigravid, 49% fertility therapy, 80% structurally normal heart, 25% XO karyotype). Based on American Society of Reproductive Medicine criteria, 10 pregnancies occurred in women stratified to high-risk category. There were no CV events in the pregnant women or in the non-pregnant women with TS. Obstetric events complicated 12 (18%) pregnancies with 9 (13%) attributed to hypertensive disorder of pregnancy. Fetal events included small for gestational age neonates (18%), preterm delivery (15%) and fetal death (3%). CONCLUSIONS:This study helps to refine the approach to pregnancy in women with TS. Among women with TS without structural heart disease, pregnancy does not impose an increased risk of CV outcomes. Among women with TS with structural heart disease, the risk of pregnancy is not as prohibitive as previously described but does require ongoing evaluation.</td>\n",

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S):Fertility choices, spontaneous pregnancy, and oocyte donation (OD) outcomes. Conditions associated with aortic dissection and poor pregnancy outcomes at preconception were considered. Pregnancy-related aortic dimension changes and the long-term impact of pregnancy on TS-related comorbidities were assessed. RESULTS(S):In all, 13.5% had spontaneous pregnancies, resulting in a pregnancy with live birth in 18 patients (37 newborns); 16% considered OD, one adopted, and one underwent fertility preservation. Spontaneous pregnancy predictive factors were a karyotype with a second or third cell line with more than one X and spontaneous menarche. In all, 47.6% had miscarriages, two experienced preeclampsia, and two had gestational diabetes. One daughter was diagnosed with TS in adulthood. Seven of 14 who attempted OD had a pregnancy with live birth; two of seven had gestational diabetes; 64.3% attempting OD had risk factors associated with poor pregnancy outcomes, including four who had double embryo transfer. Cardiac status at preconception was evaluated in 12 of 25 women who had a pregnancy. The aortic diameters during pregnancy increased. The aortic growth at sinuses was 0.51 ± 0.71 mm/year and at ascending aorta 0.67 ± 0.67 mm/year, reaching a significant difference at sinuses compared with the growth in nulliparous TS. Among women who had a pregnancy, none experienced aortic dissection during and in the years after pregnancy.

Therefore, this study aimed to clarify the current situation of pregnancy and delivery in women with TS in Japan. METHODS:Our study comprised primary and secondary surveys and we included perinatal centers approved by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare. RESULTS:A total of 24 cases from 19 facilities were reported, and we obtained individual information for 20 cases from 16 facilities. Of these 20 patients, 13 (65%) had become pregnant via oocyte donation. Three of these patients had received oocyte donation in Japan, while the other 10 had received donations in foreign countries. The other seven patients became pregnant with their own oocyte, with spontaneous menarche. Live babies were delivered by 18 patients, while an induced abortion was required at 18 weeks of gestation in one patient and an intrauterine fetal death from an unknown cause was detected at 38 weeks of gestation in another patient. Cesarean section was performed in 14 patients, with the most frequent indication being cephalopelvic disproportion. The rate of implementation of screening for complications related to TS was low, suggesting insufficient cooperation between facilities responsible for TS treatment, infertility and pregnancy and delivery management. CONCLUSION:To improve pregnancy outcomes in women with TS, improved cooperation between facilities and laws regarding oocyte donation in Japan are needed.</td>\n",

METHODS:Cognitive abilities were measured using the Mullen Scales of Early Learning at 1 year of age for 31 girls with TS and compared with neurotypical female (N = 53) and male (N = 54) control groups. Temperament (Carey Toddler Temperament Scales) and adaptive functioning (Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales-Second Edition) were measured at 1 year of age and compared with normative data. An exploratory analysis of cognitive/developmental trajectories was also conducted comparing age 12-month to 24-month time points for 22 TS subjects. RESULTS:Infants with TS performed largely within the average range for adaptive behavior, temperament, and early cognitive development with some increased risk for delays in language and significant increased risk for delays in motor skills (p &lt; 0.001). Although exploratory, there was some suggestion of slower rates of progression in fine-motor and visual reception skills from 12 to 24 months of age. CONCLUSIONS:Infants and toddlers with TS exhibit a relatively positive neurodevelopmental profile overall, with some indication of an increasing gap in function in fine-motor and visual perceptual abilities as compared to neurotypical peers. It is unclear whether these apparent differences represent normal variability in this very young population or, perhaps, are early precursors of later phenotypic characteristics of TS in the school-age and young adult years.</td>\n",

Scientific literature suggests an association between hearing loss and Turner syndrome, but it remains a controversial topic. OBJECTIVE:To associate the cytogenetic alteration with the audiometric profile of individuals with Turner syndrome. METHODS:Cross-sectional study, with a hospital-based, convenience sample. Patients diagnosed with Turner syndrome were included and those with difficulty understanding the audiometry and/or other associated syndromes were excluded. The participants were studied with pure tone audiometry. RESULTS:Of the 65 patients included, 36.9% had X chromosome monosomy and 63.0% had other alterations. Regarding the audiometry, 64.6% had normal thresholds and 35.3% had hearing impairment. Of these, 30.4% had hybrid hearing loss, 26.0% alteration at 6 and/or 8kHz, 17.3% had conductive hearing loss, 13.0% sensorineural loss and 13.0% had mixed hearing loss. We observed that the mild degree was the most frequent one. There was no statistically significant association between the cytogenetic type of Turner syndrome and the presence or absence of hearing loss, or with the type and degree of hearing loss. CONCLUSION:The cytogenetic alteration in Turner syndrome was not associated with the audiometric profile, which showed variability regarding the type and degree of hearing loss.</td>\n",

       "19  BACKGROUND:Turner syndrome (TS) is a chromosomal disorder, in which a female is partially or entirely missing one of the two X chromosomes, with a prevalence of 1:2500 live female births. The present study aims to identify a circulating microRNA (miRNA) signature for TS patients with and without congenital heart disease (CHD). METHODS:Microarray platform interrogating 2549 miRNAs were used to detect the miRNA abundance levels in the blood of 33 TS patients and 14 age-matched healthy volunteer controls (HVs). The differentially abundant miRNAs between the two groups were further validated by RT-qPCR. RESULTS:We identified 60 differentially abundant miRNA in the blood of TS patients compared to HVs, from which, 41 and 19 miRNAs showed a higher and a lower abundance levels in TS patients compared to HVs, respectively. RT-qPCR confirmed the significantly higher abundance levels of eight miRNAs namely miR-374b-5p, miR-199a-5p, miR-340-3p, miR-125b-5p, miR-30e-3p, miR-126-3p, miR-5695, and miR-26b-5p in TS patients as compared with the HVs. The abundance level of miR-5695 was higher in TS patients displaying CHD as compared to TS patients without CHD (p = 0.0265; log2-fold change 1.99); whereas, the abundance level of miR-126-3p was lower in TS patients with congenital aortic valve disease (AVD) compared to TS patients without BAV (p = 0.0139, log2-fold change 1.52). The clinical feature statistics revealed that miR-126-3p had a significant correlation with sinotubular junction Z-score (r = 0.42; p = 0.0154). CONCLUSION:The identified circulating miRNAs signature for TS patients with manifestations associated with cardiovascular diseases provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of TS that may guide the development of novel diagnostic approaches.                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "8   Turner syndrome (TS) is associated with coronary artery disease (CAD), an important cause of premature death in TS. However, the determinants of CAD in women with TS remain unknown. In a cross-sectional study design, 168 women without clinical evidence of CAD (115 with TS and 53 without TS) were assessed for the presence and volume of subclinical CAD using coronary CT angiography. Karyotype, the presence of congenital heart defects and conventional cardiovascular risk factors were also registered. Comparative analyses were performed (1) between women with and without TS and (2) in the TS group, between women with and without subclinical CAD. The prevalence of CAD, in crude and adjusted analyses, was not increased for women with TS (crude prevalence: 40 [35%] in TS vs. 25 [47%] in controls, p = 0.12). The volume of atherosclerosis was not higher in women with TS compared with controls (median and interquartile range 0 [0-92] in TS vs. 0 [0-81]mm3 in controls, p = 0.29). Among women with TS, women with subclinical CAD were older (46 ± 13 vs. 37 ± 11 years, p < 0.001), had higher blood pressure (systolic blood pressure 129 ± 16 vs. 121 ± 16 mmHg, p < 0.05) and were more frequently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes (5 [13%] vs. 2 [3%], p < 0.05). Karyotype or congenital heart defects were not associated with subclinical CAD. Some women with TS show early signs of CAD, however overall, not more than women without TS. Conventional cardiovascular risk factors were the principal determinants of CAD also in TS, and CAD prevention strategies should be observed.ClinicalTrial.gov Identifier: NCT01678261 ( https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01678261 ).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "12  Background: The cognitive profile of Turner syndrome, a genetic disorder resulting from partial or complete X-chromosome deletion, presents characteristic deficits. Despite this, studies have yet to evaluate how deficits translate into and are compensated for in academic settings. This study seeks to explore cognitive functioning, as well as the accessibility and development of academic accommodations in females with Turner syndrome from adolescence to adulthood. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study took place at the National Institutes of Health. Females with Turner syndrome (age range: 10-68; n = 142) were evaluated on need for and procurement of academic accommodations. Cognitive functioning was evaluated in participants aged 20 years and older (n = 101), as per the age validation of the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, one-sample comparisons, and analyses of variance. Results: Females with Turner syndrome scored significantly lower than the normative population on visuospatial (p < 0.001), delayed memory (p < 0.001), and overall (p < 0.001) functioning. About 25.9% of participants reported that accommodations were not needed, despite displaying one or more cognitive deficits. Approximately 12.7% reported needing but not receiving accommodations, however, this is only reported by females 30 years and older; no females aged 10-29 years indicated this discrepancy. Conclusions: Findings suggest that procurement of academic accommodations has increased within recent decades. Still, there is a discrepancy between those displaying cognitive deficits and those receiving academic accommodations. We highlight frequently received accommodations so that students and professionals can target deficits with appropriate accommodations.                                                                             \n",
       "4   BACKGROUND:Turner syndrome (TS) occurs in approximately 1 in 2500 live female births and is caused by the partial or complete loss of one of the X chromosomes, resulting in abnormalities such as ovarian failure and infertility. However, pregnancy in women with TS may still occur via spontaneous pregnancy or through oocyte donation. Limited data exists on pregnancy in women with TS that could aid in clinical care. METHODS:We conducted a population-based cross-sectional study using data from the Discharge Abstract Database (2004-2015), which contains all labor and delivery hospitalizations across Canada (excluding Quebec) where women delivered a live or stillborn infant. The odds of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes for women with and without TS were calculated using backwards multivariable logistic regression with generalized estimating equations, adjusting for the Obstetric Comorbidity Index, mode of delivery, and year. RESULTS:Overall, 2,682,284 women delivered a live or stillborn infant during the study period and 44 birth events occurred for women with TS. No severe maternal morbidity or adverse cardiovascular events occurred for women with TS at their labor and delivery hospitalization. However, infants born to women with TS were 3.6 times more likely (95% CI: 1.7-7.8) to experience neonatal morbidity than those born to women without TS. These infants also were more likely to have had a preterm birth (aOR: 2.9, 95% CI: 1.6-5.4) and to be small-for-gestational-age (aOR: 4.5, 95% CI: 2.4-8.4). CONCLUSION:This study adds further understanding of the likelihood of adverse outcomes for pregnant women with TS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "13  Turner syndrome (TS) is a genetic disorder affecting approximately 1:2000 live-born females. It results from partial or complete X monosomy and is associated with a range of clinical issues including a unique cognitive profile and increased risk for certain behavioral problems. Structural neuroimaging studies in adolescents, adults, and older children with TS have revealed altered neuroanatomy but are unable to identify when in development differences arise. In addition, older children and adults have often been exposed to years of growth hormone and/or exogenous estrogen therapy with potential implications for neurodevelopment. The study presented here is the first to test whether brain structure is altered in infants with TS. Twenty-six infants with TS received high-resolution structural MRI scans of the brain at 1 year of age and were compared to 47 typically developing female and 39 typically developing male infants. Results indicate that the typical neuroanatomical profile seen in older individuals with TS, characterized by decreased gray matter volumes in premotor, somatosensory, and parietal-occipital cortex, is already present at 1 year of age, suggesting a stable phenotype with origins in the prenatal or early postnatal period.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "11  Turner syndrome (TS) is a common multiple congenital anomaly syndrome resulting from complete or partial absence of the second X chromosome. In this study, we explore the phenotype of TS in diverse populations using clinical examination and facial analysis technology. Clinical data from 78 individuals and images from 108 individuals with TS from 19 different countries were analyzed. Individuals were grouped into categories of African descent (African), Asian, Latin American, Caucasian (European descent), and Middle Eastern. The most common phenotype features across all population groups were short stature (86%), cubitus valgus (76%), and low posterior hairline 70%. Two facial analysis technology experiments were conducted: TS versus general population and TS versus Noonan syndrome. Across all ethnicities, facial analysis was accurate in diagnosing TS from frontal facial images as measured by the area under the curve (AUC). An AUC of 0.903 (p < .001) was found for TS versus general population controls and 0.925 (p < .001) for TS versus individuals with Noonan syndrome. In summary, we present consistent clinical findings from global populations with TS and additionally demonstrate that facial analysis technology can accurately distinguish TS from the general population and Noonan syndrome.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "16  Turner syndrome is one of the most common sex chromosomal anomalies, characterized by the complete or partial loss of one X chromosome. Females with Turner syndrome are characterized by skeletal abnormalities, short stature and primary ovarian insufficiency. The aim of this narrative review was to identify the underlying mechanisms of osteoporosis in Turner syndrome, summarize its clinical manifestations and provide suggestions regarding the management of osteoporosis. Girls and women with Turner syndrome have lower bone mineral density and a higher fracture rate than healthy individuals. The most important risk factors for osteoporosis are inadequately treated primary ovarian insufficiency, followed by intrinsic bone abnormalities. Comorbidities that further increase the risk of osteoporosis include vitamin D deficiency, celiac disease and inflammatory bowel disease. In addition, hearing problems can predispose to falls. Early initiation of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) at the age of 11-13 years, prompt titration to the adult dose after 2 years and long-term follow-up to ensure compliance with HRT are the cornerstones of osteoporosis prevention in women with Turner syndrome.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "10  Turner syndrome is one of the most common chromosomal anomalies occurring in live-born females. It has been extensively reviewed in the medical literature, yet little has been discussed regarding the skeletal manifestations that present to the orthopaedic surgeon. It is important for the orthopaedic surgeon to be familiar with the clinical findings and comorbid conditions in Turner syndrome because they may be the first line of diagnosis when a patient presents for short stature, scoliosis, or slipped capital femoral epiphysis. Recent studies have identified the short stature homeobox gene as the main cause of the skeletal differences in patients with Turner syndrome, affecting longitudinal bone growth. Skeletal deformities including short stature, delayed skeletal maturation, angular deformity of the limbs, spinal deformity, and early-onset osteoporosis have been associated with Turner syndrome. This article will review the skeletal manifestations of Turner syndrome and propose guidelines for the treatment and monitoring of these patients.

       "6   In Japan, anabolic steroid hormone (ASH) treatment for Turner syndrome (TS) to promote growth had been provided before GH therapy for TS was approved. ASH effectively improved the adult height (AH) of TS patients without spontaneous puberty but decreased the AH of TS patients with spontaneous puberty. Although GH therapy for TS was approved in 1991, the approved dosage remained 0.5 IU/kg/wk for GH-deficient TS patients and improved AH by approximately 7 cm. However, AH did not reach -2 standard deviations in healthy girls. In 1999, the requirement of GH deficiency was removed and a dose of 1.0 IU/kg/wk was approved. Although an increase in AH was expected, no reports showed significant improvements in AH at a high dose of GH. GH + ASH combination therapy was reevaluated and recommended for TS patients with gonadal failure and an extremely short stature or those who respond poorly to GH therapy. Although early estrogen replacement therapy is recommended to improve psychological quality of life and prevent osteoporosis, it lowered AH even at a low dose of ethinyl estradiol (25 ng/kg/d). The initiation of ethynyl estradiol at an extremely low dose (1-5 ng/kg/d) at a relatively young age successfully improved AH.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "3   Girls with Turner syndrome (TS) are at increased risk of developing insulin resistance and coronary artery disease as a result of hypertension and obesity frequently seen in these patients. On the other hand, it is known that obesity is associated with increased serum levels of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs: valine; leucine and isoleucine) and aromatic amino acids. The aim of the study is to compare the metabolic fingerprint of girls with TS to the metabolic fingerprint of girls with obesity. Metabolic fingerprinting using an untargeted metabolomic approach was examined in plasma from 46 girls with TS (study group) and 22 age-matched girls with obesity (control group). The mean values of BCAAs, methionine, phenylalanine, lysine, tryptophan, histidine, tyrosine, alanine and ornithine were significantly lower in the study group than in the control (p from 0.0025 to <0.000001). Strong significant correlation between BCAAs, phenylalanine, arginine, tyrosine, glutamic acid, citrulline and alanine, and body mass index expressed as standard deviation score BMI-SDS in the patients with obesity (p from 0.049 to 0.0005) was found. In contrast; there was no correlation between these amino acids and BMI-SDS in the girls with TS. It is suggested that obesity in patients with TS is not associated with altered amino acids metabolism.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "7   OBJECTIVE:The early diagnosis of Turner syndrome (TS) is often difficult because of the various clinical features. This study aimed to investigate clinical features and identify associated abnormalities in a group of patients with TS. METHODS:Retrospective data of presenting clinical features collected from the medical records of the 37 patients with TS. All patients were examined for associated clinical abnormalities. RESULTS:Mean age at diagnosis was 9.3±4.1 years. The main reason for referral was short stature and/or delayed puberty. All of the patients had at least one dysmorphic sign. Skeletal system abnormalities (57%) were the most common associated abnormality, which was followed by gastrointestinal system problems (40%). Cardiac defects occurred in 32%. Urinary system abnormalities occurred in 27%. Dermatological problems were detected in 32% of the patients. The pathology of the hearing was found in 19%. Autoimmune thyroid disease was detected in 24% of the patients, and celiac disease was detected in 5.4% of the patients. CONCLUSION:Phenotypic variability often leads to a delay in the diagnosis of TS. Early diagnosis can initiate effective management in patients with TS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "2   BACKGROUND:Turner syndrome (TS) is a chromosomal disorder with short stature as the most common feature. The aim of this paper is to show the characteristics of TS patients treated at our Clinic, with an emphasis on their age at diagnosis and the effect of growth hormone therapy on their final height and height gain. METHODS:This retrospective study is based on the medical records of 37 female pediatric patients aged 0-18 years treated at the Pediatric Department of the Sestre milosrdnice University Hospital Center from 1997 to 2017. RESULTS:Mean age at diagnosis is 7.55 ±5.13 years. In the observed period a trend towards later diagnosis was shown (p=0.004). Most patients (26) were treated with rhGH. The average height of all patients who reached their final height (n=30) was 151.49 ±6.49 cm (SDS -1.73 ±1.11). The initial height SDS was significantly lower in the treated compared to the untreated patients (p=0.02). The final height was 151.59 ±7.21 cm (SDS -1.72 ±1.3) in the treated and 151.12 ±5.85 cm (SDS -1.77 ±0.94) in the untreated patients. The difference between the initial and final height was significantly greater in the treated patients compared to the untreated patients (30.46 and 16.28 cm, p=0.039). The same was true for the difference between the initial and final height SDS (0.78, or -0.3, p=0.042). CONCLUSIONS:Based on the results of this research, TS is increasingly diagnosed at a later age. The effect of rhGH therapy was favorable and resulted in a greater height gain in the treated patients.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "14  Parsonage Turner syndrome (otherwise known as PTS, neuralgic amyotrophy or acute brachial neuritis) is a rare, but clinically significant cause of atraumatic shoulder girdle pain and weakness. Diagnosis is primarily clinical and can be challenging due to its heterogeneous presentation. A case of PTS following systemic infection from Staphylococcus aureus spondylodiscitis is presented. Timely consideration of the diagnosis prevented unnecessary investigation and allowed effective rehabilitation. This is the first case of PTS preceded by S. aureus infection. PTS should be considered in those presenting with acute, atraumatic shoulder dysfunction after systemic infection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "0   OBJECTIVES:Women with Turner syndrome (TS) are frequently counselled against pregnancy due to lack of data and unclear aortic dissection risk. However, with advances in fertility therapy, more women with TS are contemplating pregnancy. This study compared rates of adverse cardiovascular (CV) outcomes among: (1) pregnant and non-pregnant women with TS and (2) pregnant women with TS with/without structural heart disease. METHODS:Retrospective analysis of pregnant and age-matched non-pregnant controls with TS (2005-2017) across 10 CV centres was done. Data were collected at initial evaluation in pregnancy and outcomes were assessed to 6 months postpartum. Adverse CV events were defined as CV death, aortic dissection/rupture and/or aortic intervention. Non-pregnant age-matched controls were followed over the same time period. RESULTS:Sixty-eight pregnancies were included (60 women, mean age 33 years, 48% primigravid, 49% fertility therapy, 80% structurally normal heart, 25% XO karyotype). Based on American Society of Reproductive Medicine criteria, 10 pregnancies occurred in women stratified to high-risk category. There were no CV events in the pregnant women or in the non-pregnant women with TS. Obstetric events complicated 12 (18%) pregnancies with 9 (13%) attributed to hypertensive disorder of pregnancy. Fetal events included small for gestational age neonates (18%), preterm delivery (15%) and fetal death (3%). CONCLUSIONS:This study helps to refine the approach to pregnancy in women with TS. Among women with TS without structural heart disease, pregnancy does not impose an increased risk of CV outcomes. Among women with TS with structural heart disease, the risk of pregnancy is not as prohibitive as previously described but does require ongoing evaluation.                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "1   OBJECTIVE:To study fertility issues and pregnancy outcomes in Turner syndrome (TS). DESIGN:Retrospective cohort study. SETTING:Not applicable. PATIENT(S):One hundred fifty-six TS patients, median age 32 years, 23 mosaic 45,X/46,XX, 45,X/47,XXX, 45,X/46,XX/47,XXX. INTERVENTION(S):None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S):Fertility choices, spontaneous pregnancy, and oocyte donation (OD) outcomes. Conditions associated with aortic dissection and poor pregnancy outcomes at preconception were considered. Pregnancy-related aortic dimension changes and the long-term impact of pregnancy on TS-related comorbidities were assessed. RESULTS(S):In all, 13.5% had spontaneous pregnancies, resulting in a pregnancy with live birth in 18 patients (37 newborns); 16% considered OD, one adopted, and one underwent fertility preservation. Spontaneous pregnancy predictive factors were a karyotype with a second or third cell line with more than one X and spontaneous menarche. In all, 47.6% had miscarriages, two experienced preeclampsia, and two had gestational diabetes. One daughter was diagnosed with TS in adulthood. Seven of 14 who attempted OD had a pregnancy with live birth; two of seven had gestational diabetes; 64.3% attempting OD had risk factors associated with poor pregnancy outcomes, including four who had double embryo transfer. Cardiac status at preconception was evaluated in 12 of 25 women who had a pregnancy. The aortic diameters during pregnancy increased. The aortic growth at sinuses was 0.51 ± 0.71 mm/year and at ascending aorta 0.67 ± 0.67 mm/year, reaching a significant difference at sinuses compared with the growth in nulliparous TS. Among women who had a pregnancy, none experienced aortic dissection during and in the years after pregnancy. CONCLUSION(S):This study highlights the importance of a TS-dedicated multidisciplinary management of pregnancy, before and during pregnancy and in the postpartum period.   \n",
       "9   AIM:Reports on pregnancy and delivery in women with Turner syndrome (TS) in Japan are limited to case reports, and the current situation remains unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to clarify the current situation of pregnancy and delivery in women with TS in Japan. METHODS:Our study comprised primary and secondary surveys and we included perinatal centers approved by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare. RESULTS:A total of 24 cases from 19 facilities were reported, and we obtained individual information for 20 cases from 16 facilities. Of these 20 patients, 13 (65%) had become pregnant via oocyte donation. Three of these patients had received oocyte donation in Japan, while the other 10 had received donations in foreign countries. The other seven patients became pregnant with their own oocyte, with spontaneous menarche. Live babies were delivered by 18 patients, while an induced abortion was required at 18 weeks of gestation in one patient and an intrauterine fetal death from an unknown cause was detected at 38 weeks of gestation in another patient. Cesarean section was performed in 14 patients, with the most frequent indication being cephalopelvic disproportion. The rate of implementation of screening for complications related to TS was low, suggesting insufficient cooperation between facilities responsible for TS treatment, infertility and pregnancy and delivery management. CONCLUSION:To improve pregnancy outcomes in women with TS, improved cooperation between facilities and laws regarding oocyte donation in Japan are needed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "5   OBJECTIVE:To examine the early cognitive, temperament, and adaptive functioning of infants and toddlers with Turner syndrome (TS). METHODS:Cognitive abilities were measured using the Mullen Scales of Early Learning at 1 year of age for 31 girls with TS and compared with neurotypical female (N = 53) and male (N = 54) control groups. Temperament (Carey Toddler Temperament Scales) and adaptive functioning (Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales-Second Edition) were measured at 1 year of age and compared with normative data. An exploratory analysis of cognitive/developmental trajectories was also conducted comparing age 12-month to 24-month time points for 22 TS subjects. RESULTS:Infants with TS performed largely within the average range for adaptive behavior, temperament, and early cognitive development with some increased risk for delays in language and significant increased risk for delays in motor skills (p < 0.001). Although exploratory, there was some suggestion of slower rates of progression in fine-motor and visual reception skills from 12 to 24 months of age. CONCLUSIONS:Infants and toddlers with TS exhibit a relatively positive neurodevelopmental profile overall, with some indication of an increasing gap in function in fine-motor and visual perceptual abilities as compared to neurotypical peers. It is unclear whether these apparent differences represent normal variability in this very young population or, perhaps, are early precursors of later phenotypic characteristics of TS in the school-age and young adult years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "18  Physical manifestations of Turner syndrome include short stature, a webbed neck, and a shield chest with widely spaced nipples. An aspect of the disease which has not been sufficiently explored so far is the tactile sensitivity of Turner syndrome patients. Thus, the aim of the study was to assess the threshold of tactile sensitivity on hands and feet of women suffering from Turner syndrome. Information on the participants of the study was collected on the basis of questionnaires, as well as anthropometric measurements using a skinfold caliper. Semmes-Weinstein Aesthesiometer was used to find the tactile sensitivity threshold of hands and feet of study participants. Based on the results of the study, significant differences in tactile sensitivity between women with Turner syndrome and healthy women were found. Affected women seem be more sensitive to the touch on the feet than healthy volunteers. The results of the study showed that the tactile sensitivity of women with Turner syndrome is different from that of healthy women.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "15  INTRODUCTION:Turner syndrome is a frequent genetic disorder that affects female individuals and covers a large phenotypic variability. Scientific literature suggests an association between hearing loss and Turner syndrome, but it remains a controversial topic. OBJECTIVE:To associate the cytogenetic alteration with the audiometric profile of individuals with Turner syndrome. METHODS:Cross-sectional study, with a hospital-based, convenience sample. Patients diagnosed with Turner syndrome were included and those with difficulty understanding the audiometry and/or other associated syndromes were excluded. The participants were studied with pure tone audiometry. RESULTS:Of the 65 patients included, 36.9% had X chromosome monosomy and 63.0% had other alterations. Regarding the audiometry, 64.6% had normal thresholds and 35.3% had hearing impairment. Of these, 30.4% had hybrid hearing loss, 26.0% alteration at 6 and/or 8kHz, 17.3% had conductive hearing loss, 13.0% sensorineural loss and 13.0% had mixed hearing loss. We observed that the mild degree was the most frequent one. There was no statistically significant association between the cytogenetic type of Turner syndrome and the presence or absence of hearing loss, or with the type and degree of hearing loss. CONCLUSION:The cytogenetic alteration in Turner syndrome was not associated with the audiometric profile, which showed variability regarding the type and degree of hearing loss.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "17  This report describes a clinically rare and atypical case of 46,X,idic(X)(q21.32)/45,X-type Turner syndrome with rapidly progressive puberty development. After 11 months of treatment with recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH), the child's height increased. After 18 months of treatment with rhGH, the child showed secondary sex characteristics. The child was followed up for 1 year after the appearance of the secondary sex characteristics, and regular menses were still present. This case indicates that modern molecular biology techniques should be used rationally to further investigate the existence of X-chromosome translocations and occult chimeras to prevent misdiagnosis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

The disease, which afflicts millions of patients worldwide mainly in low income countries, is characterized by high morbidity, mortality and low life expectancy. The new pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies for SCD is urgent in order to promote treatments able to reduce patient's suffering and improve their quality of life. Since the FDA approval of HU in 1998, there have been few advances in discovering new drugs; however, in the last three years voxelotor, crizanlizumab, and glutamine have been approved as new therapeutic alternatives. In addition, new promising compounds have been described to treat the main SCD symptoms. Herein, focusing on drug discovery, we discuss new strategies to treat SCD that have been carried out in the last ten years to discover new, safe, and effective treatments. Moreover, nonpharmacological approaches, including red blood cell exchange, gene therapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation will be presented.</td>\n",

We assessed the burden, characteristics, and types of priapism, including sexual dysfunction, in a cohort of men with and those without SCD, to test the hypothesis that sexual dysfunction is more prevalent in men with SCD. In Kano, Nigeria, we conducted a comparative cross-sectional survey that included 500 and 250 men 18 to 40 years of age, with and without SCD, respectively. The survey used the Priapism Questionnaire and the International Index of Erectile Function for sexual function assessment. All eligible participants approached for the study gave informed consent and were enrolled. Stuttering and major priapism were defined based on the average duration of priapism experiences that lasted ≤4 and &gt;4 hours, respectively. The prevalence of priapism was significantly higher in men with SCD than in those without it (32.6% vs 2%; P &lt; .001). Stuttering priapism accounted for 73.6% of the priapism episodes in men with SCD. Nearly 50% of the participants with SCD-related priapism had never sought medical attention for this complication. The majority of the men with SCD-related priapism used exercise as a coping mechanism. Priapism affected the self-image of the men with SCD, causing sadness, embarrassment, and fear. The percentage of the men with SCD who had erectile dysfunction was more than twofold higher than that of those without SCD who had erectile dysfunction (P = .01).

Data Sources: A comprehensive literature search of PubMed (1966 to April 2020) was conducted. Key search terms included GBT440, sickle cell, and voxelotor. Other sources were derived from bibliographies of articles, product labeling, manufacturer's website, and news releases. ClinicalTrials.gov was searched for additional studies. Study Selection and Data Extraction: All English-language articles identified from the data sources were reviewed and evaluated. Case reports/series and phase 1 through 3 clinical trials were included. Data Synthesis: SCD is an inherited disorder associated with significant morbidity and early mortality. Three medications approved for SCD reduce SCD-associated complications but do not selectively ameliorate the underlying disease. Voxelotor is a novel agent that targets the pathophysiology of SCD. A phase 3 trial reported an increase in mean Hb level from baseline for voxelotor compared with placebo (1.1 vs -0.1 g/dL; P &lt; 0.001). Voxelotor is generally well tolerated, with common adverse effects including headache, diarrhea, nausea, and arthralgia. Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: Voxelotor may be considered for patients with SCD who have continued anemia and hemolysis despite being on maximum tolerated dose of hydroxyurea or in those who are hydroxyurea intolerant. Voxelotor is costly; therefore, both cost and benefit should be weighed before prescribing. Conclusion: Voxelotor appears to be safe and effective as monotherapy or in combination with hydroxyurea for patients with SCD who are 12 years of age and older.</td>\n",

Sickle cell disease occurs frequently in sub-Saharan Africa, but is also common in Turkey, Greece, Sicily, the Middle East, India, and the Americas. Polymerization of deoxygenated sickle hemoglobin leads to decreased deformability of red blood cells. These altered erythrocytes can obstruct small blood vessels and cause acute episodes of pain, hemolytic anemia, and organ damage. Complications can vary between the different genotypes and it is important to be aware of the special features of the disease.

This study aimed to evaluate lung function and induced sputum levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in Bahraini children and adolescents with SCD and assess their relationship with the recurrence of acute chest syndrome (ACS). METHODS:A total of 139 children and adolescents with SCD and 123 healthy children (control group) were included in the present study. Patients were further stratified according to age and history of ACS. The patient and control groups underwent pulmonary function tests (PFTs), including spirometry and assessments of lung volume, diffusion of carbon monoxide (DLCO), and induced sputum IL-6 levels. RESULTS:Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1 ), force vital capacity (FVC), FEV1 /FVC, total lung capacity, DLCO, and DLCOc (ie, hemoglobin-corrected DLCO) were significantly lower, while residual volume and sputum IL-6 levels were significantly higher in the patient group than in the control group. PFT parameters were more compromised in the patient subgroup with a history of ACS and older than 12 years compared with the subgroup without a history of ACS and the subgroup under 12 years of age. PFTs revealed significant negative correlations with age, number of ACS events, and sputum IL-6 levels. CONCLUSION:Pulmonary function was observed to worsen with disease progression, and it worsened with older age and repeated occurrence of ACS. Induced sputum IL-6 levels reflected the degree of lung inflammation in affected patients and were associated with more impairment in various PFT parameters.</td>\n",

       "      <td>BACKGROUND:Sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the commonest severe monogenic disorders in the world, due to the inheritance of two abnormal haemoglobin (beta globin) genes. SCD can cause severe pain, significant end-organ damage, pulmonary complications, and premature death. Surgical interventions are more common in people with SCD, and occur at much younger ages than in the general population. Blood transfusions are frequently used prior to surgery and several regimens are used but there is no consensus over the best method or the necessity of transfusion in specific surgical cases. This is an update of a Cochrane Review. OBJECTIVES:To determine whether there is evidence that preoperative blood transfusion in people with SCD undergoing elective or emergency surgery reduces mortality and perioperative or sickle cell-related serious adverse events. To compare the effectiveness of different transfusion regimens (aggressive or conservative) if preoperative transfusions are indicated in people with SCD. SEARCH METHODS:We searched for relevant trials in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the Transfusion Evidence Library (from 1980), and ongoing trial databases; all searches current to 28 January 2020 We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register: 19 September 2019. SELECTION CRITERIA:All randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing preoperative blood transfusion regimens to different regimens or no transfusion in people with SCD undergoing elective or emergency surgery. There was no restriction by outcomes examined, language or publication status. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS:Two authors independently assessed trial eligibility and the risk of bias and extracted data. MAIN RESULTS:Three trials with 990 participants were eligible for inclusion in the review. There were no ongoing trials identified. These trials were conducted between 1988 and 2011. The majority of people included had haemoglobin (Hb) SS SCD. The majority of surgical procedures were considered low or intermediate risk for developing sickle cell-related complications. Aggressive versus simple red blood cell transfusions One trial (551 participants) compared an aggressive transfusion regimen (decreasing sickle haemoglobin to less than 30%) to a simple transfusion regimen (increasing haemoglobin to 100 g/L). This trial re-randomised participants and therefore quantitative analysis was only possible on two subsets of data: participants undergoing cholecystectomy (230 participants); and participants undergoing tonsillectomy or adenoidectomy surgeries (107 participants). Data were not combined as we do not know if any participant received both surgeries. Overall, the quality of the evidence was very low across different outcomes according to GRADE methodology. This was due to the trial being at high risk of bias primarily due to lack of blinding, indirectness and the outcome estimates being imprecise. Cholecystectomy subgroup results are reported in the abstract. Results for both subgroups were similar. There was no difference in all-cause mortality between people receiving aggressive transfusions and those receiving conservative transfusions. No deaths occurred in either subgroup. There were no differences between the aggressive transfusion group and conservative transfusion group in the number of people developing: • an acute chest syndrome, risk ratio (RR) 0.84 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.38 to 1.84) (one trial, 230 participants, very low-quality evidence); • vaso-occlusive crisis, risk ratio 0.30 (95% CI 0.09 to 1.04) (one trial, 230 participants, very low quality evidence); • serious infection, risk ratio 1.75 (95% CI 0.59 to 5.18) (one trial, 230 participants, very low-quality evidence); • any perioperative complications, RR 0.75 (95% CI 0.36 to 1.55) (one trial, 230 participants, very low-quality evidence); • a transfusion-related complication, RR 1.85 (95% CI 0.89 to 3.88) (one trial, 230 participants, very low-quality evidence). Preoperative transfusion versus no preoperative transfusion Two trials (434 participants) compared a preoperative transfusion plus standard care to a group receiving standard care. Overall, the quality of the evidence was low to very low across different outcomes according to GRADE methodology. This was due to the trials being at high risk of bias due to lack of blinding, and outcome estimates being imprecise. One trial was stopped early because more people in the no transfusion arm developed an acute chest syndrome. There was no difference in all-cause mortality between people receiving preoperative transfusions and those receiving no preoperative transfusions (two trials, 434 participants, no deaths occurred). There was significant heterogeneity between the two trials in the number of people developing an acute chest syndrome, a meta-analysis was therefore not performed. One trial showed a reduced number of people developing acute chest syndrome between people receiving preoperative transfusions and those receiving no preoperative transfusions, risk ratio 0.11 (95% confidence interval 0.01 to 0.80) (65 participants), whereas the other trial did not, RR 4.81 (95% CI 0.23 to 99.61) (369 participants). There were no differences between the preoperative transfusion groups and the groups without preoperative transfusion in the number of people developing: • a vaso-occlusive crisis, Peto odds ratio (OR) 1.91 (95% confidence interval 0.61 to 6.04) (two trials, 434 participants, very low-quality evidence). • a serious infection, Peto OR 1.29 (95% CI 0.29 to 5.71) (two trials, 434 participants, very low-quality evidence); • any perioperative complications, RR 0.24 (95% CI 0.03 to 2.05) (one trial, 65 participants, low-quality evidence). There was an increase in the number of people developing circulatory overload in those receiving preoperative transfusions compared to those not receiving preoperative transfusions in one of the two trials, and no events were seen in the other trial (no meta-analysis performed). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS:There is insufficient evidence from randomised trials to determine whether conservative preoperative blood transfusion is as effective as aggressive preoperative blood transfusion in preventing sickle-related or surgery-related complications in people with HbSS disease. There is very low quality evidence that preoperative blood transfusion may prevent development of acute chest syndrome. Due to lack of evidence this review cannot comment on management for people with HbSC or HbSβ+ disease or for those with high baseline haemoglobin concentrations.</td>\n",

This is a retrospective population-based study of SCD- and SCT-related ED visits and admissions from 2006 to 2015. Data were acquired from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP), National Inpatient Sample (NIS), and National Emergency Department Sample (NEDS) database. Cost-to-charge and estimated professional fee ratios were applied to approximate costs. Over 80% of medical expenditure on HbSS is through ED-based admissions. There is a statistically significant increase from 2006 to 2015 in the direct hospital admissions associated with patients less than 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with SCT.Conclusion: Among patients less than 18 years of age with HbSS, inpatient admissions through the emergency department accounted for the largest medical expenditure of the SCD subtypes.What is Known:• There are currently no multi-year, nationwide analyses of acute care utilization in sickle cell disease and sickle cell trait (SCT) in the pediatric population.• SCT is more common than SCD, affecting 1.5% of all infants born in the USA.What is New:• Comprehensive annual costs of acute care utilization of patients less than 18 years of age with SCD and SCT in the USA which includes aggregated demographical patient care data and to illustrate temporal trends of acute care utilization in children less than 18 years of age with SCD and SCT• Among patients less than 18 years of age with HbSS, inpatient admissions through the emergency department accounted for the largest medical expenditure of the sickle cell disease subtypes.</td>\n",

Nine hundred and seventy-three (46.1%; 95% CI: 44.0-48.2) and 37.9% (95% CI: 35.9-40.0) subjects indicated, respectively, that SCD is an acquired and hereditary disease. Moreover, 53.6% (95% CI: 51.5-55.7) said that the diagnosis of SCD is made by blood tests, while 46.2% (95% CI: 44.1-48.3) talked about urine tests. About 85.6% were unaware of the risk of children becoming sickle cell patients when both parents have SCD. To prevent SCD, pre-marital screening was cited by only 7.7% (95% CI: 6.6-8.9) of subjects and no measure was known by 25.4% (95% CI: 23.6-27.3). However, 79.6% (95% CI: 77.8-81.3) approved the need of pre-marital screening of SCD.Discussion: This study highlighted that the Kisangani university students' knowledge regarding SCD is poor and needs to be improved; education programs and motivational campaigns to be enhanced.</td>\n",

       "      <td>INTRODUCTION:In sickle cell disease (SCD), hemoglobin S (HbS) red blood cells (RBCs) are characteristically deformed and inflexible. Often breaking down in the circulation, they exhibit increased adhesive properties with the endothelium and activated neutrophils and platelets, increasing the risk of occlusion of the microcirculation. SCD is categorized into two sub-phenotypes: hyperhemolytic, associated with priapism, leg ulcers, pulmonary hypertension, and stroke, and high hemoglobin/viscosity, which may promote vaso-occlusion-associated pain, acute chest syndrome, and osteonecrosis. AREAS COVERED:The sub-phenotypes are not completely distinct. Hemolysis may trigger vaso-occlusion, contributing to vascular complications. Targeting P-selectin, a key mediator of cross-talk between hyperhemolysis and vaso-occlusion, may be beneficial for vascular and vaso-occlusion-associated complications. English-language articles from PubMed on the topic of SCD and vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs) were reviewed from 1 January 2000 to 1 January 2019 using the search terms 'sickle cell disease,' 'vaso-occlusive crises,' and 'selectin.' EXPERT OPINION:Besides targeting P-selectin, other strategies to counter VOCs and RBC sickling are being pursued. These include platelet inhibition to counter aggregation, intercellular adhesion, and thrombosis during VOCs; gene therapy to correct the homozygous missense mutation in the β-globin gene, causing polymerization of HbS; L-glutamine, possibly reducing oxidative stress in sickled RBCs; and fetal hemoglobin inducers.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is an important cause of vascular morbidity and mortality. Many risk factors have been identified for venous thrombosis that lead to alterations in blood flow, activate the vascular endothelium, and increase the propensity for blood coagulation. However, the precise molecular and cellular mechanisms that cause blood clots in the venous vasculature have not been fully elucidated. Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) demonstrate all the risk factors for venous stasis, activated endothelium, and blood hypercoagulability, making them particularly vulnerable to VTE. In this review, we will discuss how mouse models have elucidated the complex vascular pathobiology of SCD. We review the dysregulated pathways of inflammation and coagulation in SCD and how the resultant hypercoagulable state can potentiate thrombosis through down-regulation of vascular anticoagulants. Studies of VTE pathogenesis using SCD mouse models may provide insight into the intersection between the cellular and molecular processes involving inflammation and coagulation and help to identify novel mechanistic pathways.</td>\n",

So far, no effective approaches to prevent or treat this condition have been recognized. We conducted a single-center observational study in 68 adult sickle cell patients, encompassing 17 with sickle cell anemia (SCA), 38 with sickle cell thalassemia (HbS/β-Thal), and 13 with HbSC disease. The aim of our study was to assess liver damage in the three main forms of SCD, through the evaluation of clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings. In our population, the role of hepatotropic viruses, high BMI, and alcohol consumption in liver damage was ruled out. SCA and HbS/β-Thal patients with lower Hb (p &lt; 0.001), higher HbS (p &lt; 0.001), and frequent vaso-occlusive crises showed functional (GGT values: SCA and HbS/β-Thal vs HbSC p = 0.047 and p = 0.009, respectively) and structural liver abnormalities, defined by abdominal ultrasound and vibration-controlled transient elastography (liver stiffness values: SCA and HbS/β-Thal vs HbSC p 0.022 and p 0.19, respectively), more severe than HbSC patients. Through univariate and multivariate analyses, male sex, SCA genotype, lower HbF, frequent transfusions, increased GGT values, and abnormal liver ultrasound and stiffness were identified as potentially early markers of sickle hepatopathy.</td>\n",

Antioxidants are studied in SCD due to their potential to ensure redox balance and minimize deleterious effects on erythrocyte membranes. The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the efficacy of antioxidant nutrient supplementation on reducing hemolysis in SCD patients through randomized clinical trials. We conducted our study according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses and the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions investigating whether antioxidants could improve the hemolytic status of SCD patients. This study included 587 articles published until April 2020. We reduced this pool to 12 articles by excluding duplicates, reviews, comments, and studies with non-human subjects. Omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin A, and zinc were the antioxidants that reportedly improved the indirect hemolysis parameters such as hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume, or red blood cells. High-dose vitamin C and E supplementation worsened hemolysis, causing increased reticulocytes, lactate dehydrogenase, indirect bilirubin, and haptoglobin. More intervention studies especially high-quality controlled randomized clinical trials are needed to investigate the effects of antioxidant nutrients in reducing hemolysis in SCD.</td>\n",

       "      <td>BACKGROUND:Sickle cell disease (SCD) is associated with significant medical challenges that often worsen in adolescence when caregivers are beginning to transfer responsibility for disease management. Behavioral activation (BA) is an important precedent to improvements in self-management and ultimately health outcomes; however, few interventions targeting BA have been developed for the SCD population. The goal of the present study was to evaluate a technology-enhanced self-management intervention for adolescents and young adults (AYA) with SCD targeting BA domains (ie, disease knowledge, self-efficacy, motivation, and self-management skills). DESIGN/METHODS:Participants were randomized to one of two study arms. SCThrive participants (N = 26) completed six weekly group sessions, an in-person booster session, and used a companion app (iManage) to record symptoms, progress on goals, and connect with other group members. Each SCHealthEd participant (N = 27) received six weekly phone calls on SCD-related and general health education topics. All AYA completed questionnaires assessing BA at baseline and posttreatment. RESULTS:Separate mixed ANOVA analyses to assess for the effects of group (SCThrive/SCHealthEd), time (baseline/posttreatment), and group × time interaction indicated that there was a clinically meaningful improvement (8-point change) in self-efficacy, with a medium effect size, P = .09, η2  = .06, and there was statistically significant improvement in one self-management skill (tracking health), P = .001, d = .71, among SCThrive participants. CONCLUSIONS:The results support the potential for a self-management intervention to improve self-efficacy in AYA with SCD. Health care providers are encouraged to target BA skills to support self-management of AYA with SCD.</td>\n",

Disease manifestations in the abdomen most commonly result from vaso-occlusion, hemolysis, or infection due to functional asplenia. Organ specific manifestations include those involving the liver (eg, hepatopathy, iron deposition), gallbladder (eg, stone formation), spleen (eg, infarction, abscess formation, sequestration), kidneys (eg, papillary necrosis, infarction), pancreas (eg, pancreatitis), gastrointestinal tract (eg, infarction), reproductive organs (eg, priapism, testicular atrophy), bone (eg, marrow changes, avascular necrosis), vasculature (eg, vasculopathy), and lung bases (eg, acute chest syndrome, infarction). Imaging provides an important clinical tool for evaluation of acute and chronic disease manifestations and complications. In summary, there are multifold abdominal manifestations of sickle cell disease. Recognition of these sequela helps guide management and improves outcomes.

Once believed to represent a benign carrier state, it has been linked to an increased risk of several of the pathological conditions that arise in sickle cell disease in at-risk individuals with hematologic and vascular comorbidities. Macular infarction is a known complication of sickle cell disease, but this report illustrates this unique presentation in a patient with sickle cell trait. METHODS:Case report PATIENT:: A 74-year old African American male presented with the complaint of a central scotoma of the right eye. RESULTS:Multimodal retinal imaging identified central macular infarction with severe inner retinal atrophy. Laboratory testing confirmed the presence of sickle cell trait. Other pertinent positives included low levels of protein C and protein S, untreated obstructive sleep apnea, and elevated levels of homocysteine in the setting of alcoholic liver cirrhosis and chronic kidney disease. CONCLUSIONS:Ocular manifestations of sickle cell trait have most frequently been reported in individuals with systemic medical comorbidities that predispose to red blood cell sickling and vaso-occlusive disease.

Transcranial Doppler (TCD) is useful at identifying increased risk of stroke in children with SCD and vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage. The main aim of this study was to determine the proportion of patients with SCD in the Gulf region who are at a high risk of stroke, as determined by TCD.Methods: This multicenter (Oman, Qatar, and UAE), descriptive, cross-sectional study in patients (aged 2-16 years) with SCD included a baseline visit, 1 follow-up visit for patients with conditional TCD, and 3-year retrospective data analysis for all patients.Results: Of the 410 eligible patients (Oman, 86.5%; Qatar, 8.2%; UAE, 5.1%), most had a TCD finding (left side, 91.7%; right side, 92.0%) of normal velocity (&lt;155 cm/s) at baseline. For 6 of 7 patients with conditional velocity (155-179 cm/s) and 1 patient with high velocity (≥180 cm/s), baseline TCD results were not confirmed at follow-up. As per bivariate linear regression, age, race, transfusion type, and transfusion frequency were significant predictors of the TCD velocities. Multivariate logistic regressions revealed that TCD velocities were significantly correlated with sex, race, and type of transfusion. No patients reported any adverse events at follow-up. No deaths occurred during the study.Discussion/Conclusions: The study results show that far fewer patients with SCD in the Gulf have abnormal TCD findings than the internationally reported. Larger studies are needed to identify the factors underlying this observation.</td>\n",

       "3   Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is an inherited disorder of red blood cells that is caused by a single mutation in the βglobin gene. The disease, which afflicts millions of patients worldwide mainly in low income countries, is characterized by high morbidity, mortality and low life expectancy. The new pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies for SCD is urgent in order to promote treatments able to reduce patient's suffering and improve their quality of life. Since the FDA approval of HU in 1998, there have been few advances in discovering new drugs; however, in the last three years voxelotor, crizanlizumab, and glutamine have been approved as new therapeutic alternatives. In addition, new promising compounds have been described to treat the main SCD symptoms. Herein, focusing on drug discovery, we discuss new strategies to treat SCD that have been carried out in the last ten years to discover new, safe, and effective treatments. Moreover, nonpharmacological approaches, including red blood cell exchange, gene therapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation will be presented.

       "10  Sickle cell disease is an inherited disorder that affects more than 100,000 individuals in the United States and results in a shortened life span. Characterized by the production of abnormal, sickle-shaped hemoglobin, the disease is marked by anemia, vaso-occlusion of blood vessels, and tissue damage. In November 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved voxelotor (Oxbryta) as a novel treatment for sickle cell disease. Voxelotor inhibits the production of sickle hemoglobin and improves anemia. This article presents an overview of voxelotor, including adverse effects, use in special populations, and implications for nursing practice.

       "4   Recurrent ischemic priapism is a common complication of sickle cell disease (SCD). We assessed the burden, characteristics, and types of priapism, including sexual dysfunction, in a cohort of men with and those without SCD, to test the hypothesis that sexual dysfunction is more prevalent in men with SCD. In Kano, Nigeria, we conducted a comparative cross-sectional survey that included 500 and 250 men 18 to 40 years of age, with and without SCD, respectively. The survey used the Priapism Questionnaire and the International Index of Erectile Function for sexual function assessment. All eligible participants approached for the study gave informed consent and were enrolled. Stuttering and major priapism were defined based on the average duration of priapism experiences that lasted ≤4 and >4 hours, respectively. The prevalence of priapism was significantly higher in men with SCD than in those without it (32.6% vs 2%; P < .001). Stuttering priapism accounted for 73.6% of the priapism episodes in men with SCD. Nearly 50% of the participants with SCD-related priapism had never sought medical attention for this complication. The majority of the men with SCD-related priapism used exercise as a coping mechanism. Priapism affected the self-image of the men with SCD, causing sadness, embarrassment, and fear. The percentage of the men with SCD who had erectile dysfunction was more than twofold higher than that of those without SCD who had erectile dysfunction (P = .01). The men with SCD had a higher prevalence of priapism and sexual dysfunction than the men without SCD.

       "7   Objective: To review the pharmacological characteristics, clinical evidence, and place in therapy of voxelotor for the treatment of sickle cell disease (SCD). Data Sources: A comprehensive literature search of PubMed (1966 to April 2020) was conducted. Key search terms included GBT440, sickle cell, and voxelotor. Other sources were derived from bibliographies of articles, product labeling, manufacturer's website, and news releases. ClinicalTrials.gov was searched for additional studies. Study Selection and Data Extraction: All English-language articles identified from the data sources were reviewed and evaluated. Case reports/series and phase 1 through 3 clinical trials were included. Data Synthesis: SCD is an inherited disorder associated with significant morbidity and early mortality. Three medications approved for SCD reduce SCD-associated complications but do not selectively ameliorate the underlying disease. Voxelotor is a novel agent that targets the pathophysiology of SCD. A phase 3 trial reported an increase in mean Hb level from baseline for voxelotor compared with placebo (1.1 vs -0.1 g/dL; P < 0.001). Voxelotor is generally well tolerated, with common adverse effects including headache, diarrhea, nausea, and arthralgia. Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: Voxelotor may be considered for patients with SCD who have continued anemia and hemolysis despite being on maximum tolerated dose of hydroxyurea or in those who are hydroxyurea intolerant. Voxelotor is costly; therefore, both cost and benefit should be weighed before prescribing. Conclusion: Voxelotor appears to be safe and effective as monotherapy or in combination with hydroxyurea for patients with SCD who are 12 years of age and older.

       "1   The term \"sickle cell disease\" covers a group of genetic blood disorders caused by sickle hemoglobin (HbS) alone or in combination with other variants of the β‑globin locus. Sickle cell disease occurs frequently in sub-Saharan Africa, but is also common in Turkey, Greece, Sicily, the Middle East, India, and the Americas. Polymerization of deoxygenated sickle hemoglobin leads to decreased deformability of red blood cells. These altered erythrocytes can obstruct small blood vessels and cause acute episodes of pain, hemolytic anemia, and organ damage. Complications can vary between the different genotypes and it is important to be aware of the special features of the disease. Hydroxycarbamide has been shown to reduce the morbidity and mortality of patients with sickle cell disease. New drugs and novel treatment approaches such as gene therapy are currently being tested.

       "16  BACKGROUND:Sickle cell disease (SCD) is relatively common in Bahrain, and airway inflammation in patients with SCD is usually multifactorial. This study aimed to evaluate lung function and induced sputum levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in Bahraini children and adolescents with SCD and assess their relationship with the recurrence of acute chest syndrome (ACS). METHODS:A total of 139 children and adolescents with SCD and 123 healthy children (control group) were included in the present study. Patients were further stratified according to age and history of ACS. The patient and control groups underwent pulmonary function tests (PFTs), including spirometry and assessments of lung volume, diffusion of carbon monoxide (DLCO), and induced sputum IL-6 levels. RESULTS:Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1 ), force vital capacity (FVC), FEV1 /FVC, total lung capacity, DLCO, and DLCOc (ie, hemoglobin-corrected DLCO) were significantly lower, while residual volume and sputum IL-6 levels were significantly higher in the patient group than in the control group. PFT parameters were more compromised in the patient subgroup with a history of ACS and older than 12 years compared with the subgroup without a history of ACS and the subgroup under 12 years of age. PFTs revealed significant negative correlations with age, number of ACS events, and sputum IL-6 levels. CONCLUSION:Pulmonary function was observed to worsen with disease progression, and it worsened with older age and repeated occurrence of ACS. Induced sputum IL-6 levels reflected the degree of lung inflammation in affected patients and were associated with more impairment in various PFT parameters.

       "12  BACKGROUND:Sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the commonest severe monogenic disorders in the world, due to the inheritance of two abnormal haemoglobin (beta globin) genes. SCD can cause severe pain, significant end-organ damage, pulmonary complications, and premature death. Surgical interventions are more common in people with SCD, and occur at much younger ages than in the general population. Blood transfusions are frequently used prior to surgery and several regimens are used but there is no consensus over the best method or the necessity of transfusion in specific surgical cases. This is an update of a Cochrane Review. OBJECTIVES:To determine whether there is evidence that preoperative blood transfusion in people with SCD undergoing elective or emergency surgery reduces mortality and perioperative or sickle cell-related serious adverse events. To compare the effectiveness of different transfusion regimens (aggressive or conservative) if preoperative transfusions are indicated in people with SCD. SEARCH METHODS:We searched for relevant trials in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the Transfusion Evidence Library (from 1980), and ongoing trial databases; all searches current to 28 January 2020 We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register: 19 September 2019. SELECTION CRITERIA:All randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing preoperative blood transfusion regimens to different regimens or no transfusion in people with SCD undergoing elective or emergency surgery. There was no restriction by outcomes examined, language or publication status. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS:Two authors independently assessed trial eligibility and the risk of bias and extracted data. MAIN RESULTS:Three trials with 990 participants were eligible for inclusion in the review. There were no ongoing trials identified. These trials were conducted between 1988 and 2011. The majority of people included had haemoglobin (Hb) SS SCD. The majority of surgical procedures were considered low or intermediate risk for developing sickle cell-related complications. Aggressive versus simple red blood cell transfusions One trial (551 participants) compared an aggressive transfusion regimen (decreasing sickle haemoglobin to less than 30%) to a simple transfusion regimen (increasing haemoglobin to 100 g/L). This trial re-randomised participants and therefore quantitative analysis was only possible on two subsets of data: participants undergoing cholecystectomy (230 participants); and participants undergoing tonsillectomy or adenoidectomy surgeries (107 participants). Data were not combined as we do not know if any participant received both surgeries. Overall, the quality of the evidence was very low across different outcomes according to GRADE methodology. This was due to the trial being at high risk of bias primarily due to lack of blinding, indirectness and the outcome estimates being imprecise. Cholecystectomy subgroup results are reported in the abstract. Results for both subgroups were similar. There was no difference in all-cause mortality between people receiving aggressive transfusions and those receiving conservative transfusions. No deaths occurred in either subgroup. There were no differences between the aggressive transfusion group and conservative transfusion group in the number of people developing: • an acute chest syndrome, risk ratio (RR) 0.84 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.38 to 1.84) (one trial, 230 participants, very low-quality evidence); • vaso-occlusive crisis, risk ratio 0.30 (95% CI 0.09 to 1.04) (one trial, 230 participants, very low quality evidence); • serious infection, risk ratio 1.75 (95% CI 0.59 to 5.18) (one trial, 230 participants, very low-quality evidence); • any perioperative complications, RR 0.75 (95% CI 0.36 to 1.55) (one trial, 230 participants, very low-quality evidence); • a transfusion-related complication, RR 1.85 (95% CI 0.89 to 3.88) (one trial, 230 participants, very low-quality evidence). Preoperative transfusion versus no preoperative transfusion Two trials (434 participants) compared a preoperative transfusion plus standard care to a group receiving standard care. Overall, the quality of the evidence was low to very low across different outcomes according to GRADE methodology. This was due to the trials being at high risk of bias due to lack of blinding, and outcome estimates being imprecise. One trial was stopped early because more people in the no transfusion arm developed an acute chest syndrome. There was no difference in all-cause mortality between people receiving preoperative transfusions and those receiving no preoperative transfusions (two trials, 434 participants, no deaths occurred). There was significant heterogeneity between the two trials in the number of people developing an acute chest syndrome, a meta-analysis was therefore not performed. One trial showed a reduced number of people developing acute chest syndrome between people receiving preoperative transfusions and those receiving no preoperative transfusions, risk ratio 0.11 (95% confidence interval 0.01 to 0.80) (65 participants), whereas the other trial did not, RR 4.81 (95% CI 0.23 to 99.61) (369 participants). There were no differences between the preoperative transfusion groups and the groups without preoperative transfusion in the number of people developing: • a vaso-occlusive crisis, Peto odds ratio (OR) 1.91 (95% confidence interval 0.61 to 6.04) (two trials, 434 participants, very low-quality evidence). • a serious infection, Peto OR 1.29 (95% CI 0.29 to 5.71) (two trials, 434 participants, very low-quality evidence); • any perioperative complications, RR 0.24 (95% CI 0.03 to 2.05) (one trial, 65 participants, low-quality evidence). There was an increase in the number of people developing circulatory overload in those receiving preoperative transfusions compared to those not receiving preoperative transfusions in one of the two trials, and no events were seen in the other trial (no meta-analysis performed). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS:There is insufficient evidence from randomised trials to determine whether conservative preoperative blood transfusion is as effective as aggressive preoperative blood transfusion in preventing sickle-related or surgery-related complications in people with HbSS disease. There is very low quality evidence that preoperative blood transfusion may prevent development of acute chest syndrome. Due to lack of evidence this review cannot comment on management for people with HbSC or HbSβ+ disease or for those with high baseline haemoglobin concentrations.   \n",
       "14  The objective of this study was to analyze acute care utilization of sickle cell disease (SCD) and sickle cell trait (SCT) in children and identify trends in emergency department (ED) visits and inpatient admissions over a 10-year period. This is a retrospective population-based study of SCD- and SCT-related ED visits and admissions from 2006 to 2015. Data were acquired from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP), National Inpatient Sample (NIS), and National Emergency Department Sample (NEDS) database. Cost-to-charge and estimated professional fee ratios were applied to approximate costs. Over 80% of medical expenditure on HbSS is through ED-based admissions. There is a statistically significant increase from 2006 to 2015 in the direct hospital admissions associated with patients less than 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with SCT.Conclusion: Among patients less than 18 years of age with HbSS, inpatient admissions through the emergency department accounted for the largest medical expenditure of the SCD subtypes.What is Known:• There are currently no multi-year, nationwide analyses of acute care utilization in sickle cell disease and sickle cell trait (SCT) in the pediatric population.• SCT is more common than SCD, affecting 1.5% of all infants born in the USA.What is New:• Comprehensive annual costs of acute care utilization of patients less than 18 years of age with SCD and SCT in the USA which includes aggregated demographical patient care data and to illustrate temporal trends of acute care utilization in children less than 18 years of age with SCD and SCT• Among patients less than 18 years of age with HbSS, inpatient admissions through the emergency department accounted for the largest medical expenditure of the sickle cell disease subtypes.

       "0   Background: Education is needed as an action to reduce morbidity and mortality from sickle cell disease (SCD), an important but largely neglected risk to child survival in most African countries as Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).Objective: To assess the knowledge of Kisangani University students in DRC regarding SCD.Methods: In this non-experimental, cross-sectional study, a validated questionnaire was used to assess the knowledge of 2 112 Kisangani University students in DRC and data were analyzed using SPSS version 20.Results: Most participants, 92.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 91.7-93.9) were knowledgeable about SCD and have heard about it through schools and/or universities (46.3%), followed by family (34.5%) and health-care workers (23.5%). Nine hundred and seventy-three (46.1%; 95% CI: 44.0-48.2) and 37.9% (95% CI: 35.9-40.0) subjects indicated, respectively, that SCD is an acquired and hereditary disease. Moreover, 53.6% (95% CI: 51.5-55.7) said that the diagnosis of SCD is made by blood tests, while 46.2% (95% CI: 44.1-48.3) talked about urine tests. About 85.6% were unaware of the risk of children becoming sickle cell patients when both parents have SCD. To prevent SCD, pre-marital screening was cited by only 7.7% (95% CI: 6.6-8.9) of subjects and no measure was known by 25.4% (95% CI: 23.6-27.3). However, 79.6% (95% CI: 77.8-81.3) approved the need of pre-marital screening of SCD.Discussion: This study highlighted that the Kisangani university students' knowledge regarding SCD is poor and needs to be improved; education programs and motivational campaigns to be enhanced.

       "13  INTRODUCTION:In sickle cell disease (SCD), hemoglobin S (HbS) red blood cells (RBCs) are characteristically deformed and inflexible. Often breaking down in the circulation, they exhibit increased adhesive properties with the endothelium and activated neutrophils and platelets, increasing the risk of occlusion of the microcirculation. SCD is categorized into two sub-phenotypes: hyperhemolytic, associated with priapism, leg ulcers, pulmonary hypertension, and stroke, and high hemoglobin/viscosity, which may promote vaso-occlusion-associated pain, acute chest syndrome, and osteonecrosis. AREAS COVERED:The sub-phenotypes are not completely distinct. Hemolysis may trigger vaso-occlusion, contributing to vascular complications. Targeting P-selectin, a key mediator of cross-talk between hyperhemolysis and vaso-occlusion, may be beneficial for vascular and vaso-occlusion-associated complications. English-language articles from PubMed on the topic of SCD and vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs) were reviewed from 1 January 2000 to 1 January 2019 using the search terms 'sickle cell disease,' 'vaso-occlusive crises,' and 'selectin.' EXPERT OPINION:Besides targeting P-selectin, other strategies to counter VOCs and RBC sickling are being pursued. These include platelet inhibition to counter aggregation, intercellular adhesion, and thrombosis during VOCs; gene therapy to correct the homozygous missense mutation in the β-globin gene, causing polymerization of HbS; L-glutamine, possibly reducing oxidative stress in sickled RBCs; and fetal hemoglobin inducers.

       "6   Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is an important cause of vascular morbidity and mortality. Many risk factors have been identified for venous thrombosis that lead to alterations in blood flow, activate the vascular endothelium, and increase the propensity for blood coagulation. However, the precise molecular and cellular mechanisms that cause blood clots in the venous vasculature have not been fully elucidated. Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) demonstrate all the risk factors for venous stasis, activated endothelium, and blood hypercoagulability, making them particularly vulnerable to VTE. In this review, we will discuss how mouse models have elucidated the complex vascular pathobiology of SCD. We review the dysregulated pathways of inflammation and coagulation in SCD and how the resultant hypercoagulable state can potentiate thrombosis through down-regulation of vascular anticoagulants. Studies of VTE pathogenesis using SCD mouse models may provide insight into the intersection between the cellular and molecular processes involving inflammation and coagulation and help to identify novel mechanistic pathways.

       "11  Sickle hepatopathy is a severe and not rare complication of sickle cell disease (SCD), showing mainly a cholestatic pattern. So far, no effective approaches to prevent or treat this condition have been recognized. We conducted a single-center observational study in 68 adult sickle cell patients, encompassing 17 with sickle cell anemia (SCA), 38 with sickle cell thalassemia (HbS/β-Thal), and 13 with HbSC disease. The aim of our study was to assess liver damage in the three main forms of SCD, through the evaluation of clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings. In our population, the role of hepatotropic viruses, high BMI, and alcohol consumption in liver damage was ruled out. SCA and HbS/β-Thal patients with lower Hb (p < 0.001), higher HbS (p < 0.001), and frequent vaso-occlusive crises showed functional (GGT values: SCA and HbS/β-Thal vs HbSC p = 0.047 and p = 0.009, respectively) and structural liver abnormalities, defined by abdominal ultrasound and vibration-controlled transient elastography (liver stiffness values: SCA and HbS/β-Thal vs HbSC p 0.022 and p 0.19, respectively), more severe than HbSC patients. Through univariate and multivariate analyses, male sex, SCA genotype, lower HbF, frequent transfusions, increased GGT values, and abnormal liver ultrasound and stiffness were identified as potentially early markers of sickle hepatopathy.

       "9   Hemolysis is one of the main pathophysiological characteristics of sickle cell disease (SCD) and might cause or could be the result of oxidative stress. Antioxidants are studied in SCD due to their potential to ensure redox balance and minimize deleterious effects on erythrocyte membranes. The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the efficacy of antioxidant nutrient supplementation on reducing hemolysis in SCD patients through randomized clinical trials. We conducted our study according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses and the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions investigating whether antioxidants could improve the hemolytic status of SCD patients. This study included 587 articles published until April 2020. We reduced this pool to 12 articles by excluding duplicates, reviews, comments, and studies with non-human subjects. Omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin A, and zinc were the antioxidants that reportedly improved the indirect hemolysis parameters such as hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume, or red blood cells. High-dose vitamin C and E supplementation worsened hemolysis, causing increased reticulocytes, lactate dehydrogenase, indirect bilirubin, and haptoglobin. More intervention studies especially high-quality controlled randomized clinical trials are needed to investigate the effects of antioxidant nutrients in reducing hemolysis in SCD.

       "8   BACKGROUND:Sickle cell disease (SCD) is associated with significant medical challenges that often worsen in adolescence when caregivers are beginning to transfer responsibility for disease management. Behavioral activation (BA) is an important precedent to improvements in self-management and ultimately health outcomes; however, few interventions targeting BA have been developed for the SCD population. The goal of the present study was to evaluate a technology-enhanced self-management intervention for adolescents and young adults (AYA) with SCD targeting BA domains (ie, disease knowledge, self-efficacy, motivation, and self-management skills). DESIGN/METHODS:Participants were randomized to one of two study arms. SCThrive participants (N = 26) completed six weekly group sessions, an in-person booster session, and used a companion app (iManage) to record symptoms, progress on goals, and connect with other group members. Each SCHealthEd participant (N = 27) received six weekly phone calls on SCD-related and general health education topics. All AYA completed questionnaires assessing BA at baseline and posttreatment. RESULTS:Separate mixed ANOVA analyses to assess for the effects of group (SCThrive/SCHealthEd), time (baseline/posttreatment), and group × time interaction indicated that there was a clinically meaningful improvement (8-point change) in self-efficacy, with a medium effect size, P = .09, η2  = .06, and there was statistically significant improvement in one self-management skill (tracking health), P = .001, d = .71, among SCThrive participants. CONCLUSIONS:The results support the potential for a self-management intervention to improve self-efficacy in AYA with SCD. Health care providers are encouraged to target BA skills to support self-management of AYA with SCD.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "5   Sickle cell disease is a debilitating hematologic process that affects the entire body. Disease manifestations in the abdomen most commonly result from vaso-occlusion, hemolysis, or infection due to functional asplenia. Organ specific manifestations include those involving the liver (eg, hepatopathy, iron deposition), gallbladder (eg, stone formation), spleen (eg, infarction, abscess formation, sequestration), kidneys (eg, papillary necrosis, infarction), pancreas (eg, pancreatitis), gastrointestinal tract (eg, infarction), reproductive organs (eg, priapism, testicular atrophy), bone (eg, marrow changes, avascular necrosis), vasculature (eg, vasculopathy), and lung bases (eg, acute chest syndrome, infarction). Imaging provides an important clinical tool for evaluation of acute and chronic disease manifestations and complications. In summary, there are multifold abdominal manifestations of sickle cell disease. Recognition of these sequela helps guide management and improves outcomes. The purpose of this article is to review abdominal manifestations of sickle cell disease and discuss common and rare complications of the disease within the abdomen.

       "15  PURPOSE:Sickle cell trait affects 8% of African Americans. Once believed to represent a benign carrier state, it has been linked to an increased risk of several of the pathological conditions that arise in sickle cell disease in at-risk individuals with hematologic and vascular comorbidities. Macular infarction is a known complication of sickle cell disease, but this report illustrates this unique presentation in a patient with sickle cell trait. METHODS:Case report PATIENT:: A 74-year old African American male presented with the complaint of a central scotoma of the right eye. RESULTS:Multimodal retinal imaging identified central macular infarction with severe inner retinal atrophy. Laboratory testing confirmed the presence of sickle cell trait. Other pertinent positives included low levels of protein C and protein S, untreated obstructive sleep apnea, and elevated levels of homocysteine in the setting of alcoholic liver cirrhosis and chronic kidney disease. CONCLUSIONS:Ocular manifestations of sickle cell trait have most frequently been reported in individuals with systemic medical comorbidities that predispose to red blood cell sickling and vaso-occlusive disease. This case identifies a novel complication of sickle cell trait disorder, macular infarction, in a patient with comorbid associations.

       "17  Background/Objective: Stroke is a potentially fatal complication of sickle cell disease (SCD). Transcranial Doppler (TCD) is useful at identifying increased risk of stroke in children with SCD and vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage. The main aim of this study was to determine the proportion of patients with SCD in the Gulf region who are at a high risk of stroke, as determined by TCD.Methods: This multicenter (Oman, Qatar, and UAE), descriptive, cross-sectional study in patients (aged 2-16 years) with SCD included a baseline visit, 1 follow-up visit for patients with conditional TCD, and 3-year retrospective data analysis for all patients.Results: Of the 410 eligible patients (Oman, 86.5%; Qatar, 8.2%; UAE, 5.1%), most had a TCD finding (left side, 91.7%; right side, 92.0%) of normal velocity (<155 cm/s) at baseline. For 6 of 7 patients with conditional velocity (155-179 cm/s) and 1 patient with high velocity (≥180 cm/s), baseline TCD results were not confirmed at follow-up. As per bivariate linear regression, age, race, transfusion type, and transfusion frequency were significant predictors of the TCD velocities. Multivariate logistic regressions revealed that TCD velocities were significantly correlated with sex, race, and type of transfusion. No patients reported any adverse events at follow-up. No deaths occurred during the study.Discussion/Conclusions: The study results show that far fewer patients with SCD in the Gulf have abnormal TCD findings than the internationally reported. Larger studies are needed to identify the factors underlying this observation.

       "      <td>BACKGROUND:The prevalence of fungal disease in cystic fibrosis (CF) and non-CF bronchiectasis is increasing and the clinical spectrum is widening. Poor sensitivity and a lack of standard diagnostic criteria renders interpretation of culture results challenging. In order to develop effective management strategies, a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of the airways fungal microbiome is required. The study aimed to use DNA sequences from sputum to assess the load and diversity of fungi in adults with CF and non-CF bronchiectasis. METHODS:Next generation sequencing of the ITS2 region was used to examine fungal community composition (n = 176) by disease and underlying clinical subgroups including allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, chronic necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis, non-tuberculous mycobacteria, and fungal bronchitis. Patients with no known active fungal disease were included as disease controls. RESULTS:ITS2 sequencing greatly increased the detection of fungi from sputum. In patients with CF fungal diversity was lower, while burden was higher than those with non-CF bronchiectasis. The most common operational taxonomic unit (OTU) in patients with CF was Candida parapsilosis (20.4%), whereas in non-CF bronchiectasis sputum Candida albicans (21.8%) was most common. CF patients with overt fungal bronchitis were dominated by Aspergillus spp., Exophiala spp., Candida parapsilosis or Scedosporium spp. CONCLUSION:This study provides a framework to more accurately characterize the extended spectrum of fungal airways diseases in adult suppurative lung diseases.</td>\n",

       "      <td>PURPOSE OF REVIEW:Liver disease in cystic fibrosis (CF) usually develops before puberty, is often asymptomatic and slowly progressive. Multilobular cirrhosis develops in approximately 5-10% of patients by the age of 18, and is a significant contributor to the morbidity and mortality. No therapy, including ursodeoxycholic acid and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator correctors or potentiators, has proven effective to prevent or halt the progression of liver disease towards cirrhosis and portal hypertension. This review provides the current knowledge in the epidemiology of CF liver disease and development of noninvasive tools to assess liver disease severity and progression overtime in order to optimize clinical management and therapeutic options. RECENT FINDINGS:Liver disease not only develops during childhood but also later in the lifetime of patients with CF; the incidence of cirrhosis with portal hypertension increases progressively reaching 10% by age 30. Several noninvasive tools to measure liver stiffness as an indirect measure of fibrosis are being investigated, and show promising results for the assessment of early stages of liver fibrosis and disease progression. SUMMARY:Identifying noninvasive biomarkers is fundamental to improving early diagnosis, monitoring disease evolution and measuring treatment effects. A prerequisite is the use of consistent definitions for CF- liver disease (LD) in clinical trials.</td>\n",

Illinois employs a two-step process which includes the measurement of the immunoreactive trypsinogen followed by an assay designed to detect 74 of the most common genetic mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein. We report the case of an infant born in Illinois with a positive cystic fibrosis newborn screening with an elevated immunoreactive trypsinogen and two genetic mutations identified (F508del/F508del). The primary care physician informed the parents their child had cystic fibrosis and referred her for a confirmatory sweat test which was negative for cystic fibrosis. Upon further investigation, the assay was found to have been set up incorrectly and repeat analysis identified the genotype F508del/F508C. This case highlights the importance of performing the confirmatory sweat test prior to making a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis.</td>\n",

Cystic Fibrosis affects multiple organs but progressive remodeling of the airways, mucus accumulation, and chronic inflammation in the lung, result in lung disease as the major cause of morbidity and mortality. While advances in management of CF symptoms have increased the life expectancy of this devastating disease, and there is tremendous excitement about the potential of new agents targeting the CFTR molecule itself, there is still no curative treatment. With the recent advances in the identification of endogenous airway progenitor cells and in directed differentiation of pluripotent cell sources, cell-based therapeutic approaches for CF have become a plausible treatment method with the potential to ultimately cure the disease. In this review, we highlight the current state of cell therapy in the CF field focusing on the relevant autologous and allogeneic cell populations under investigation and the challenges associated with their use. In addition, we present advances in induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell approaches and emerging new genetic engineering methods, which have the capacity to overcome the current limitations hindering cell therapy approaches.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease caused by mutations in the CFTR gene. Although viral respiratory tract infections are, in general, more severe in patients with CF compared to the general population, a small number of studies indicate that SARS-CoV-2 does not cause a worse infection in CF. This is surprising since comorbidities including preexisting lung disease have been reported to be associated with worse outcomes in SARS-CoV-2 infections. Several recent studies provide insight into why SARS-CoV-2 may not produce more severe outcomes in CF. First, ACE and ACE2, genes that play key roles in SARS-CoV-2 infection have some variants that are predicted to reduce the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Second, mRNA for ACE2 is elevated and the mRNA for TMPRSS2, a serine protease, is decreased in CF airway epithelial cells. Increased ACE2 is predicted to enhance SARS-CoV-2 binding to cells, but would increase conversion of angiotensin II, which is proinflammatory, to angiotensin-1-7, which is anti-inflammatory. Thus, increased ACE2 would reduce inflammation and lung damage due to SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, decreased TMPRSS2 would reduce SARS-CoV-2 entry into airway epithelial cells. Second, many CF patients are treated with azithromycin, which suppresses viral infection and lung inflammation, and inhibits the activity of furin, a serine protease. Finally, the CF lung contains high levels of serine protease inhibitors including ecotin and SERPINB1, which are predicted to reduce the ability of TMPRSS2 to facilitate SARS-CoV-2 entry into airway epithelial cells. Thus, a variety of factors may mitigate the severity of SARS-CoV-2 in CF.</td>\n",

       "      <td>BACKGROUND:Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a multisystem disease caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator is extensively expressed in the intestine and has an important role in the regulation of the viscosity and pH of gut secretions. Several studies have reported a delay in small bowel and colonic transit times in patients with CF which have been attributed to the secretory dysfunction. Our aim was to determine whether intestinal contractility is affected in these patients. METHODS:Consecutive patients with CF referred to our institution between 2014 and 2017 (n = 16) were prospectively investigated using automated non-invasive techniques for morpho-functional evaluation of the gut developed in our laboratory. On separate days, intraluminal images of the gut were obtained by capsule endoscopy and external images by abdominal MRI. Analysis of images (endoluminal and external) was performed with original, previously validated programs based on computer vision and machine learning techniques and compared with age- and sex-matched controls. KEY RESULTS:Patients with CF exhibited important reduction in contractile activity and increased retention of static turbid luminal content in the small bowel by endoluminal image analysis. Morpho-volumetric analysis of MRI images found increased ileo-colonic volumes in CF. Significant correlations between abnormalities detected by intraluminal and external imaging techniques were found. The presence and severity of digestive symptoms were not related to abnormal gut function. CONCLUSION AND INFERENCES:Impaired transit and pooling of gut contents in patients with CF is associated with impaired intestinal motility.</td>\n",

Historically, therapeutic development has focused on the mutated cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), leading to the discovery of small molecules aiming at modulating and potentiating the presence and activity of CFTR at the plasma membrane. However, treatment burden sustained by CF patients, side effects of current medications, and recent advances in other therapeutic areas have highlighted the need to develop novel disease targeting of the inflammatory component driving CF lung damage. Furthermore, current issues with standard treatment emphasize the need for directed lung therapies that could minimize systemic side effects.

       "      <td>BACKGROUND:Several agents are used to clear secretions from the airways of people with cystic fibrosis. Mannitol increases mucociliary clearance, but its exact mechanism of action is unknown. The dry powder formulation of mannitol may be more convenient and easier to use compared with established agents which require delivery via a nebuliser. Phase III trials of inhaled dry powder mannitol for the treatment of cystic fibrosis have been completed and it is now available in Australia and some countries in Europe. This is an update of a previous review. OBJECTIVES:To assess whether inhaled dry powder mannitol is well tolerated, whether it improves the quality of life and respiratory function in people with cystic fibrosis and which adverse events are associated with the treatment. SEARCH METHODS:We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic databases, handsearching relevant journals and abstracts from conferences. Date of last search: 12 December 2019. SELECTION CRITERIA:All randomised controlled studies comparing mannitol with placebo, active inhaled comparators (for example, hypertonic saline or dornase alfa) or with no treatment. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS:Authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, carried out data extraction and assessed the risk of bias in included studies. The quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE. MAIN RESULTS:Six studies (reported in 36 unique publications) were included with a total of 784 participants. Duration of treatment in the included studies ranged from 12 days to six months, with open-label treatment for an additional six months in two of the studies. Five studies compared mannitol with control (a very low dose of mannitol or non-respirable mannitol) and the final study compared mannitol to dornase alfa alone and to mannitol plus dornase alfa. Two large studies had a similar parallel design and provided data for 600 participants, which could be pooled where data for a particular outcome and time point were available. The remaining studies had much smaller sample sizes (ranging from 22 to 95) and data could not be pooled due to differences in design, interventions and population. Pooled evidence from the two large parallel studies was judged to be of low to moderate quality and from the smaller studies was judged to be of low to very low quality. In all studies, there was an initial test to see if participants tolerated mannitol, with only those who could tolerate the drug being randomised; therefore, the study results are not applicable to the cystic fibrosis population as a whole. While the published papers did not provide all the data required for our analysis, additional unpublished data were provided by the drug's manufacturer and the author of one of the studies. Pooling the large parallel studies comparing mannitol to control, up to and including six months, lung function (forced expiratory volume at one second) measured in both mL and % predicted was significantly improved in the mannitol group compared to the control group (moderate-quality evidence). Beneficial results were observed in these studies in adults and in both concomitant dornase alfa users and non-users in these studies. In the smaller studies, statistically significant improvements in lung function were also observed in the mannitol groups compared to the non-respirable mannitol groups; however, we judged this evidence to be of low to very low quality. For the comparisons of mannitol and control, we found no consistent differences in health-related quality of life in any of the domains except for burden of treatment, which was less for mannitol up to four months in the two pooled studies of a similar design; this difference was not maintained at six months. It should be noted that the tool used to measure health-related quality of life was not designed to assess mucolytics and pooling of the age-appropriate tools (as done in some of the included studies) may not be valid so results were judged to be low to very low quality and should be interpreted with caution. Cough, haemoptysis, bronchospasm, pharyngolaryngeal pain and post-tussive vomiting were the most commonly reported side effects in both treatment groups. Where rates of adverse events could be compared, statistically no significant differences were found between mannitol and control groups; although some of these events may have clinical relevance for people with CF. For the comparisons of mannitol to dornase alfa alone and to mannitol plus dornase alfa, very low-quality evidence from a 12-week cross-over study of 28 participants showed no statistically significant differences in the recorded domains of health-related quality of life or measures of lung function. Cough was the most common side effect in the mannitol alone arm but there was no occurrence of cough in the dornase alfa alone arm and the most commonly reported reason of withdrawal from the mannitol plus dornase alfa arm was pulmonary exacerbations. In terms of secondary outcomes of the review (pulmonary exacerbations, hospitalisations, symptoms, sputum microbiology), evidence provided by the included studies was more limited. For all comparisons, no consistent statistically significant and clinically meaningful differences were observed between mannitol and control treatments (including dornase alfa). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS:There is moderate-quality evidence to show that treatment with mannitol over a six-month period is associated with an improvement in some measures of lung function in people with cystic fibrosis compared to control. There is low to very low-quality evidence suggesting no difference in quality of life for participants taking mannitol compared to control. This review provides very low-quality evidence suggesting no difference in lung function or quality of life comparing mannitol to dornase alfa alone and to mannitol plus dornase alfa. The clinical implications from this review suggest that mannitol could be considered as a treatment in cystic fibrosis; but further research is required in order to establish who may benefit most and whether this benefit is sustained in the longer term. Furthermore, studies comparing its efficacy against other (established) mucolytic therapies need to be undertaken before it can be considered for mainstream practice.</td>\n",

To date, there are four approved medications, which are mutation-specific. Although the number of mutations that respond to these agents is expanding, effective CFTR modulators are not available to all cystic fibrosis patients. The purpose of this article is to review the approved CFTR modulators and discuss the mutations that can be treated with these agents, as well as, review the long-term benefits of modulator therapy. RECENT FINDINGS:More people with cystic fibrosis can be effectively treated with CFTR modulators. The new, highly effective triple therapy, elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor is indicated for more than 90% of patients with cystic fibrosis and ivacaftor is now approved for children as young as 6 months of age with 1 of 30 CFTR mutations. Long-term use of modulator therapy is associated with fewer pulmonary exacerbations, maintenance of lung function, improved weight gain, and quality of life. SUMMARY:CFTR modulators are the first therapies developed to treat the underlying defect in cystic fibrosis. Their use is associated with preserved lung function and improved health in patients with cystic fibrosis.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) affect the homeostasis of chloride flux by epithelial cells. This has deleterious consequences, especially in respiratory epithelia, where the defect results in mucus accumulation distinctive of cystic fibrosis. CFTR is, however, also expressed in phagocytic cells, like macrophages. Immune cells are highly sensitive to conditioning by their environment; thus, CFTR dysfunction in epithelia influences macrophages by affecting the lung milieu, but the mutations also appear to be directly consequential for intrinsic macrophage functions. Particular mutations can alter CFTR's folding, traffic of the protein to the membrane and function. As such, understanding the intrinsic effects of CFTR mutation requires distinguishing the secondary effects of misfolded CFTR on cell stress pathways from the primary defect of CFTR dysfunction/absence. Investigations into CFTR's role in macrophages have exploited various models, each with their own advantages and limitations. This review summarizes these methodologic approaches, discussing their physiological correspondence and highlighting key findings. The controversy surrounding CFTR-dependent acidification is used as a case study to highlight difficulties in commensurability across model systems. Recent work in macrophage biology, including polarization and host-pathogen interaction studies, brought into the context of CFTR research, offers potential explanations for observed discrepancies between studies. Moreover, the rapid advancement of novel gene editing technologies and new macrophage model systems makes this assessment of the field's models and methodologies timely.</td>\n",

BACKGROUND:Cystic fibrosis is one of the most difficult chronic diseases to manage long term because of numerous challenges faced on a day-to-day basis. The majority of studies focus on improving symptom response to new treatment regimens with the hope of prolonging life. Yet few qualitative studies explore the experience of adults with CF. What is missing from the current literature are the voices of people living with CF, especially as they age. DESIGN:This study follows a hermeneutic phenomenology design guided by Martin Heidegger's philosophy. METHODS:Semi-structured interviews were conducted with nine adults living with CF. Hermeneutic phenomenology guided the data interpretation. This manuscript follows COREQ reporting guidelines. RESULTS:Hermeneutic analysis revealed the overarching theme The Dance of Cystic Fibrosis which is supported by five themes: (a) the paradox of control, (b) living deaths, (c) dancing with death, (d) relearning to dance, and (e) role of the dance partner. CONCLUSIONS:The experience of living with CF as an adult is multidimensional and unique to each person. Despite the uniqueness, there is a shared experience that manifested as The Dance of Cystic Fibrosis. As life expectancy continues to increase for persons with CF, it is essential that researchers and healthcare professionals intentionally consider the life-prolonging effects of the treatment regimen alongside the persons' experience with those effects. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE:Nurses at all levels of practice should be prepared to address the multifaceted experience of living with CF through thoughtful incorporation of open-ended questions. This allows patients to share their experience with nurses, augmenting their practice of delivering holistic care.</td>\n",

Vitamin K is known to play an important role in both blood coagulation and bone formation, hence the role of supplementation of vitamin K in this category needs to be reviewed. This is an updated version of the review. OBJECTIVES:To assess the effects of vitamin K supplementation in people with cystic fibrosis and to investigate the hypotheses that vitamin K will decrease deficiency-related coagulopathy, increase bone mineral density, decrease risk of fractures and improve quality of life in people with CF. Also to determine the optimal dose and route of administration of vitamin K for people with CF (for both routine and therapeutic use). SEARCH METHODS:We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Most recent search: 12 August 2019. SELECTION CRITERIA:Randomised controlled trials of all preparations of vitamin K used as a supplement compared to either no supplementation (or placebo) at any dose or route and for any duration, in patients with cystic fibrosis. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS:Two authors independently screened papers, extracted trial details and assessed their risk of bias. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE criteria. MAIN RESULTS:Three trials (total 70 participants, aged 8 to 46 years) assessed as having a moderate risk of bias were included. One trial compared vitamin K to placebo, a second to no supplementation and the third compared two doses of vitamin K. No trial in either comparison reported our primary outcomes of coagulation and quality of life or the secondary outcomes of nutritional parameters and adverse events. Vitamin K versus control Two trials compared vitamin K to control, but data were not available for analysis. One 12-month trial (n = 38) compared 10 mg vitamin K daily or placebo in a parallel design and one trial (n = 18) was of cross-over design with no washout period and compared 5 mg vitamin K/week for four-weeks to no supplementation for four-weeks. Only the 12-month trial reported on the primary outcome of bone formation; we are very uncertain whether vitamin K supplementation has any effect on bone mineral density at the femoral hip or lumbar spine (very low-quality evidence). Both trials reported an increase in serum vitamin K levels and a decrease in undercarboxylated osteocalcin levels. The cross-over trial also reported that levels of proteins induced by vitamin K absence (PIVKA) showed a decrease and a return to normal following supplementation, but due to the very low-quality evidence we are not certain that this is due to the intervention. High-dose versus low-dose vitamin K One parallel trial (n = 14) compared 1 mg vitamin K/day to 5 mg vitamin K/day for four weeks. The trial did report that there did not appear to be any difference in serum undercarboxylated osteocalcin or vitamin K levels (very low-quality evidence). While the trial reported that serum vitamin K levels improved with supplementation, there was no difference between the high-dose and low-dose groups. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS:There is very low-quality evidence of any effect of vitamin K in people with cystic fibrosis. While there is no evidence of harm, until better evidence is available the ongoing recommendations by national CF guidelines should be followed.</td>\n",

       "      <td>BACKGROUND:Cystic fibrosis is a multi-system disease characterised by the production of thick secretions causing recurrent pulmonary infection, often with unusual bacteria. This leads to lung destruction and eventually death through respiratory failure. There are no antibiotics in development that exert a new mode of action and many of the current antibiotics are ineffective in eradicating the bacteria once chronic infection is established. Antibiotic adjuvants - therapies that act by rendering the organism more susceptible to attack by antibiotics or the host immune system, by rendering it less virulent or killing it by other means, would be a significant therapeutic advance. This is an update of a previously published review. OBJECTIVES:To determine if antibiotic adjuvants improve clinical and microbiological outcome of pulmonary infection in people with cystic fibrosis. SEARCH METHODS:We searched the Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register which is compiled from database searches, hand searches of appropriate journals and conference proceedings. Date of most recent search: 16 January 2020. We also searched MEDLINE (all years) on 14 February 2019 and ongoing trials registers on 06 April 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA:Randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised controlled trials of a therapy exerting an antibiotic adjuvant mechanism of action compared to placebo or no therapy for people with cystic fibrosis. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS:Two of the authors independently assessed and extracted data from identified trials. MAIN RESULTS:We identified 42 trials of which eight (350 participants) that examined antibiotic adjuvant therapies are included. Two further trials are ongoing and five are awaiting classification. The included trials assessed β-carotene (one trial, 24 participants), garlic (one trial, 34 participants), KB001-A (a monoclonal antibody) (two trials, 196 participants), nitric oxide (two trials, 30 participants) and zinc supplementation (two trials, 66 participants). The zinc trials recruited children only, whereas the remaining trials recruited both adults and children. Three trials were located in Europe, one in Asia and four in the USA. Three of the interventions measured our primary outcome of pulmonary exacerbations (β-carotene, mean difference (MD) -8.00 (95% confidence interval (CI) -18.78 to 2.78); KB001-A, risk ratio (RR) 0.25 (95% CI 0.03 to 2.40); zinc supplementation, RR 1.85 (95% CI 0.65 to 5.26). β-carotene and KB001-A may make little or no difference to the number of exacerbations experienced (low-quality evidence); whereas, given the moderate-quality evidence we found that zinc probably makes no difference to this outcome. Respiratory function was measured in all of the included trials. β-carotene and nitric oxide may make little or no difference to forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) (low-quality evidence), whilst garlic probably makes little or no difference to FEV1 (moderate-quality evidence). It is uncertain whether zinc or KB001-A improve FEV1 as the certainty of this evidence is very low. Few adverse events were seen across all of the different interventions and the adverse events that were reported were mild or not treatment-related (quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate). One of the trials (169 participants) comparing KB001-A and placebo, reported on the time to the next course of antibiotics; results showed there is probably no difference between groups, HR 1.00 (95% CI 0.69 to 1.45) (moderate-quality evidence). Quality of life was only reported in the two KB001-A trials, which demonstrated that there may be little or no difference between KB001-A and placebo (low-quality evidence). Sputum microbiology was measured and reported for the trials of KB001-A and nitric oxide (four trials). There was very low-quality evidence of a numerical reduction in Pseudomonas aeruginosa density with KB001-A, but it was not significant. The two trials looking at the effects of nitric oxide reported significant reductions in Staphylococcus aureus and near-significant reductions in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but the quality of this evidence is again very low. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS:We could not identify an antibiotic adjuvant therapy that we could recommend for treating of lung infection in people with cystic fibrosis. The emergence of increasingly resistant bacteria makes the reliance on antibiotics alone challenging for cystic fibrosis teams. There is a need to explore alternative strategies, such as the use of adjuvant therapies. Further research is required to provide future therapeutic options.</td>\n",

For CF patients and CF mice, we developed a HCO3 - drinking test to assess the role of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in urinary HCO3 -excretion and applied it in the patients before and after treatment with the novel CFTR modulator drug, lumacaftor-ivacaftor. RESULTS:β-Intercalated cells express basolateral secretin receptors and apical CFTR and pendrin. In vivo application of secretin induced a marked urinary alkalization, an effect absent in mice lacking pendrin or CFTR. In perfused cortical collecting ducts, secretin stimulated pendrin-dependent Cl-/HCO3 - exchange. In collecting ducts in CFTR knockout mice, baseline pendrin activity was significantly lower and not responsive to secretin. Notably, patients with CF (F508del/F508del) and CF mice showed a greatly attenuated or absent urinary HCO3 --excreting ability. In patients, treatment with the CFTR modulator drug lumacaftor-ivacaftor increased the renal ability to excrete HCO3 -. CONCLUSIONS:These results define the mechanism of secretin-induced urinary HCO3 - excretion, explain metabolic alkalosis in patients with CF, and suggest feasibility of an in vivo human CF urine test to validate drug efficacy.</td>\n",

       "      <td>BACKGROUND:General movements (GMs) in infants occur as fidgety movements (FMs) between postterm 9 and 20 weeks. We aimed to evaluate FMs and motor repertoire in infants with cystic fibrosis (CF) and their relation with clinical findings. METHODS:Demographic and clinical characteristics were recorded. FMs and motor repertoire were analyzed from a 5-min video recording of each infant. Videos were rated based on the Prechtl General Movement Assessment and motor optimality score (MOS) was calculated. RESULTS:The analysis included 18 infants with CF and 20 healthy infants at postterm age of 3-5 months. MOS was significantly lower in the infants with CF compared to controls (p &lt; 0.05). Fifty percent of the infants with CF had abnormal or absent/sporadic FMs. MOS was negatively associated with hospitalization duration (r = -0.378, p = 0.036); and positively associated with vitamin A level in CF infants (r = 0.665, p = 0.026). CONCLUSIONS:Infants with genetically anticipated severe CF phenotype tended to have lower MOS. MOS may be used in addition to genetic testing to predict disease severity in infants with CF. Infants with CF, absent/sporadic FMs, and lower MOS could be considered for planning specific age-adequate early intervention programs. IMPACT:Motor repertoire was age-inadequate in infants with cystic fibrosis (CF).50% of infants with CF had abnormal or absent/sporadic fidgety movements (FMs).Motor optimality score (MOS) was positively associated with vitamin A level and negatively correlated with hospitalization duration in infants with CF.MOS tended to decrease as genetically anticipated disease severity increased; thus, MOS might enable us to predict disease severity in CF. The relationship between motor repertoire and phenotype and genotype is unclear and warrants further study.CF infants with absent/sporadic FMs, and lower MOS could be considered for planning early intervention.</td>\n",

       "1   BACKGROUND:The prevalence of fungal disease in cystic fibrosis (CF) and non-CF bronchiectasis is increasing and the clinical spectrum is widening. Poor sensitivity and a lack of standard diagnostic criteria renders interpretation of culture results challenging. In order to develop effective management strategies, a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of the airways fungal microbiome is required. The study aimed to use DNA sequences from sputum to assess the load and diversity of fungi in adults with CF and non-CF bronchiectasis. METHODS:Next generation sequencing of the ITS2 region was used to examine fungal community composition (n = 176) by disease and underlying clinical subgroups including allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, chronic necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis, non-tuberculous mycobacteria, and fungal bronchitis. Patients with no known active fungal disease were included as disease controls. RESULTS:ITS2 sequencing greatly increased the detection of fungi from sputum. In patients with CF fungal diversity was lower, while burden was higher than those with non-CF bronchiectasis. The most common operational taxonomic unit (OTU) in patients with CF was Candida parapsilosis (20.4%), whereas in non-CF bronchiectasis sputum Candida albicans (21.8%) was most common. CF patients with overt fungal bronchitis were dominated by Aspergillus spp., Exophiala spp., Candida parapsilosis or Scedosporium spp. CONCLUSION:This study provides a framework to more accurately characterize the extended spectrum of fungal airways diseases in adult suppurative lung diseases.

       "5   PURPOSE OF REVIEW:Liver disease in cystic fibrosis (CF) usually develops before puberty, is often asymptomatic and slowly progressive. Multilobular cirrhosis develops in approximately 5-10% of patients by the age of 18, and is a significant contributor to the morbidity and mortality. No therapy, including ursodeoxycholic acid and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator correctors or potentiators, has proven effective to prevent or halt the progression of liver disease towards cirrhosis and portal hypertension. This review provides the current knowledge in the epidemiology of CF liver disease and development of noninvasive tools to assess liver disease severity and progression overtime in order to optimize clinical management and therapeutic options. RECENT FINDINGS:Liver disease not only develops during childhood but also later in the lifetime of patients with CF; the incidence of cirrhosis with portal hypertension increases progressively reaching 10% by age 30. Several noninvasive tools to measure liver stiffness as an indirect measure of fibrosis are being investigated, and show promising results for the assessment of early stages of liver fibrosis and disease progression. SUMMARY:Identifying noninvasive biomarkers is fundamental to improving early diagnosis, monitoring disease evolution and measuring treatment effects. A prerequisite is the use of consistent definitions for CF- liver disease (LD) in clinical trials.

       "7   Newborn screening for cystic fibrosis is universal across the United States; however, each state chooses the method by which they screen. Illinois employs a two-step process which includes the measurement of the immunoreactive trypsinogen followed by an assay designed to detect 74 of the most common genetic mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein. We report the case of an infant born in Illinois with a positive cystic fibrosis newborn screening with an elevated immunoreactive trypsinogen and two genetic mutations identified (F508del/F508del). The primary care physician informed the parents their child had cystic fibrosis and referred her for a confirmatory sweat test which was negative for cystic fibrosis. Upon further investigation, the assay was found to have been set up incorrectly and repeat analysis identified the genotype F508del/F508C. This case highlights the importance of performing the confirmatory sweat test prior to making a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis.

       "15  Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a multisystem disease affecting the gastrointestinal (GI) tract as well as the lungs. As survival has increased significantly over the past few decades, complications not seen previously have become apparent. There is an overall increased rate of malignancy in CF, particularly from the GI tract and in the post-transplant population. The most common sites of malignancy are the pancreatico-biliary and digestive tract, as well as an increased rate of testicular cancer. Using an illustrative case of metastatic oesophageal malignancy which initially appeared to be hepatic in origin, we have reviewed the literature surrounding malignancy in CF with a particular focus on the GI tract.

       "10  Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a chronic autosomal recessive disease caused by defects in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene (CFTR). Cystic Fibrosis affects multiple organs but progressive remodeling of the airways, mucus accumulation, and chronic inflammation in the lung, result in lung disease as the major cause of morbidity and mortality. While advances in management of CF symptoms have increased the life expectancy of this devastating disease, and there is tremendous excitement about the potential of new agents targeting the CFTR molecule itself, there is still no curative treatment. With the recent advances in the identification of endogenous airway progenitor cells and in directed differentiation of pluripotent cell sources, cell-based therapeutic approaches for CF have become a plausible treatment method with the potential to ultimately cure the disease. In this review, we highlight the current state of cell therapy in the CF field focusing on the relevant autologous and allogeneic cell populations under investigation and the challenges associated with their use. In addition, we present advances in induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell approaches and emerging new genetic engineering methods, which have the capacity to overcome the current limitations hindering cell therapy approaches.

       "13  Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease caused by mutations in the CFTR gene. Although viral respiratory tract infections are, in general, more severe in patients with CF compared to the general population, a small number of studies indicate that SARS-CoV-2 does not cause a worse infection in CF. This is surprising since comorbidities including preexisting lung disease have been reported to be associated with worse outcomes in SARS-CoV-2 infections. Several recent studies provide insight into why SARS-CoV-2 may not produce more severe outcomes in CF. First, ACE and ACE2, genes that play key roles in SARS-CoV-2 infection have some variants that are predicted to reduce the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Second, mRNA for ACE2 is elevated and the mRNA for TMPRSS2, a serine protease, is decreased in CF airway epithelial cells. Increased ACE2 is predicted to enhance SARS-CoV-2 binding to cells, but would increase conversion of angiotensin II, which is proinflammatory, to angiotensin-1-7, which is anti-inflammatory. Thus, increased ACE2 would reduce inflammation and lung damage due to SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, decreased TMPRSS2 would reduce SARS-CoV-2 entry into airway epithelial cells. Second, many CF patients are treated with azithromycin, which suppresses viral infection and lung inflammation, and inhibits the activity of furin, a serine protease. Finally, the CF lung contains high levels of serine protease inhibitors including ecotin and SERPINB1, which are predicted to reduce the ability of TMPRSS2 to facilitate SARS-CoV-2 entry into airway epithelial cells. Thus, a variety of factors may mitigate the severity of SARS-CoV-2 in CF.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "8   BACKGROUND:Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a multisystem disease caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator is extensively expressed in the intestine and has an important role in the regulation of the viscosity and pH of gut secretions. Several studies have reported a delay in small bowel and colonic transit times in patients with CF which have been attributed to the secretory dysfunction. Our aim was to determine whether intestinal contractility is affected in these patients. METHODS:Consecutive patients with CF referred to our institution between 2014 and 2017 (n = 16) were prospectively investigated using automated non-invasive techniques for morpho-functional evaluation of the gut developed in our laboratory. On separate days, intraluminal images of the gut were obtained by capsule endoscopy and external images by abdominal MRI. Analysis of images (endoluminal and external) was performed with original, previously validated programs based on computer vision and machine learning techniques and compared with age- and sex-matched controls. KEY RESULTS:Patients with CF exhibited important reduction in contractile activity and increased retention of static turbid luminal content in the small bowel by endoluminal image analysis. Morpho-volumetric analysis of MRI images found increased ileo-colonic volumes in CF. Significant correlations between abnormalities detected by intraluminal and external imaging techniques were found. The presence and severity of digestive symptoms were not related to abnormal gut function. CONCLUSION AND INFERENCES:Impaired transit and pooling of gut contents in patients with CF is associated with impaired intestinal motility.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "3   Cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease is characterized by unconventional mechanisms of inflammation, implicating a chronic immune response dominated by innate immune cells. Historically, therapeutic development has focused on the mutated cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), leading to the discovery of small molecules aiming at modulating and potentiating the presence and activity of CFTR at the plasma membrane. However, treatment burden sustained by CF patients, side effects of current medications, and recent advances in other therapeutic areas have highlighted the need to develop novel disease targeting of the inflammatory component driving CF lung damage. Furthermore, current issues with standard treatment emphasize the need for directed lung therapies that could minimize systemic side effects. Here, we summarize current treatment used to target immune cells in the lungs, and highlight potential benefits and caveats of novel therapeutic strategies.

       "4   BACKGROUND:Several agents are used to clear secretions from the airways of people with cystic fibrosis. Mannitol increases mucociliary clearance, but its exact mechanism of action is unknown. The dry powder formulation of mannitol may be more convenient and easier to use compared with established agents which require delivery via a nebuliser. Phase III trials of inhaled dry powder mannitol for the treatment of cystic fibrosis have been completed and it is now available in Australia and some countries in Europe. This is an update of a previous review. OBJECTIVES:To assess whether inhaled dry powder mannitol is well tolerated, whether it improves the quality of life and respiratory function in people with cystic fibrosis and which adverse events are associated with the treatment. SEARCH METHODS:We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic databases, handsearching relevant journals and abstracts from conferences. Date of last search: 12 December 2019. SELECTION CRITERIA:All randomised controlled studies comparing mannitol with placebo, active inhaled comparators (for example, hypertonic saline or dornase alfa) or with no treatment. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS:Authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, carried out data extraction and assessed the risk of bias in included studies. The quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE. MAIN RESULTS:Six studies (reported in 36 unique publications) were included with a total of 784 participants. Duration of treatment in the included studies ranged from 12 days to six months, with open-label treatment for an additional six months in two of the studies. Five studies compared mannitol with control (a very low dose of mannitol or non-respirable mannitol) and the final study compared mannitol to dornase alfa alone and to mannitol plus dornase alfa. Two large studies had a similar parallel design and provided data for 600 participants, which could be pooled where data for a particular outcome and time point were available. The remaining studies had much smaller sample sizes (ranging from 22 to 95) and data could not be pooled due to differences in design, interventions and population. Pooled evidence from the two large parallel studies was judged to be of low to moderate quality and from the smaller studies was judged to be of low to very low quality. In all studies, there was an initial test to see if participants tolerated mannitol, with only those who could tolerate the drug being randomised; therefore, the study results are not applicable to the cystic fibrosis population as a whole. While the published papers did not provide all the data required for our analysis, additional unpublished data were provided by the drug's manufacturer and the author of one of the studies. Pooling the large parallel studies comparing mannitol to control, up to and including six months, lung function (forced expiratory volume at one second) measured in both mL and % predicted was significantly improved in the mannitol group compared to the control group (moderate-quality evidence). Beneficial results were observed in these studies in adults and in both concomitant dornase alfa users and non-users in these studies. In the smaller studies, statistically significant improvements in lung function were also observed in the mannitol groups compared to the non-respirable mannitol groups; however, we judged this evidence to be of low to very low quality. For the comparisons of mannitol and control, we found no consistent differences in health-related quality of life in any of the domains except for burden of treatment, which was less for mannitol up to four months in the two pooled studies of a similar design; this difference was not maintained at six months. It should be noted that the tool used to measure health-related quality of life was not designed to assess mucolytics and pooling of the age-appropriate tools (as done in some of the included studies) may not be valid so results were judged to be low to very low quality and should be interpreted with caution. Cough, haemoptysis, bronchospasm, pharyngolaryngeal pain and post-tussive vomiting were the most commonly reported side effects in both treatment groups. Where rates of adverse events could be compared, statistically no significant differences were found between mannitol and control groups; although some of these events may have clinical relevance for people with CF. For the comparisons of mannitol to dornase alfa alone and to mannitol plus dornase alfa, very low-quality evidence from a 12-week cross-over study of 28 participants showed no statistically significant differences in the recorded domains of health-related quality of life or measures of lung function. Cough was the most common side effect in the mannitol alone arm but there was no occurrence of cough in the dornase alfa alone arm and the most commonly reported reason of withdrawal from the mannitol plus dornase alfa arm was pulmonary exacerbations. In terms of secondary outcomes of the review (pulmonary exacerbations, hospitalisations, symptoms, sputum microbiology), evidence provided by the included studies was more limited. For all comparisons, no consistent statistically significant and clinically meaningful differences were observed between mannitol and control treatments (including dornase alfa). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS:There is moderate-quality evidence to show that treatment with mannitol over a six-month period is associated with an improvement in some measures of lung function in people with cystic fibrosis compared to control. There is low to very low-quality evidence suggesting no difference in quality of life for participants taking mannitol compared to control. This review provides very low-quality evidence suggesting no difference in lung function or quality of life comparing mannitol to dornase alfa alone and to mannitol plus dornase alfa. The clinical implications from this review suggest that mannitol could be considered as a treatment in cystic fibrosis; but further research is required in order to establish who may benefit most and whether this benefit is sustained in the longer term. Furthermore, studies comparing its efficacy against other (established) mucolytic therapies need to be undertaken before it can be considered for mainstream practice.   \n",
       "2   PURPOSE OF REVIEW:Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance receptor (CFTR) modulators are a new class of drugs that treat the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis. To date, there are four approved medications, which are mutation-specific. Although the number of mutations that respond to these agents is expanding, effective CFTR modulators are not available to all cystic fibrosis patients. The purpose of this article is to review the approved CFTR modulators and discuss the mutations that can be treated with these agents, as well as, review the long-term benefits of modulator therapy. RECENT FINDINGS:More people with cystic fibrosis can be effectively treated with CFTR modulators. The new, highly effective triple therapy, elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor is indicated for more than 90% of patients with cystic fibrosis and ivacaftor is now approved for children as young as 6 months of age with 1 of 30 CFTR mutations. Long-term use of modulator therapy is associated with fewer pulmonary exacerbations, maintenance of lung function, improved weight gain, and quality of life. SUMMARY:CFTR modulators are the first therapies developed to treat the underlying defect in cystic fibrosis. Their use is associated with preserved lung function and improved health in patients with cystic fibrosis.

       "12  Mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) affect the homeostasis of chloride flux by epithelial cells. This has deleterious consequences, especially in respiratory epithelia, where the defect results in mucus accumulation distinctive of cystic fibrosis. CFTR is, however, also expressed in phagocytic cells, like macrophages. Immune cells are highly sensitive to conditioning by their environment; thus, CFTR dysfunction in epithelia influences macrophages by affecting the lung milieu, but the mutations also appear to be directly consequential for intrinsic macrophage functions. Particular mutations can alter CFTR's folding, traffic of the protein to the membrane and function. As such, understanding the intrinsic effects of CFTR mutation requires distinguishing the secondary effects of misfolded CFTR on cell stress pathways from the primary defect of CFTR dysfunction/absence. Investigations into CFTR's role in macrophages have exploited various models, each with their own advantages and limitations. This review summarizes these methodologic approaches, discussing their physiological correspondence and highlighting key findings. The controversy surrounding CFTR-dependent acidification is used as a case study to highlight difficulties in commensurability across model systems. Recent work in macrophage biology, including polarization and host-pathogen interaction studies, brought into the context of CFTR research, offers potential explanations for observed discrepancies between studies. Moreover, the rapid advancement of novel gene editing technologies and new macrophage model systems makes this assessment of the field's models and methodologies timely.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "0   AIMS AND OBJECTIVES:This study sought to understand the experience of living with cystic fibrosis (CF) as an adult. BACKGROUND:Cystic fibrosis is one of the most difficult chronic diseases to manage long term because of numerous challenges faced on a day-to-day basis. The majority of studies focus on improving symptom response to new treatment regimens with the hope of prolonging life. Yet few qualitative studies explore the experience of adults with CF. What is missing from the current literature are the voices of people living with CF, especially as they age. DESIGN:This study follows a hermeneutic phenomenology design guided by Martin Heidegger's philosophy. METHODS:Semi-structured interviews were conducted with nine adults living with CF. Hermeneutic phenomenology guided the data interpretation. This manuscript follows COREQ reporting guidelines. RESULTS:Hermeneutic analysis revealed the overarching theme The Dance of Cystic Fibrosis which is supported by five themes: (a) the paradox of control, (b) living deaths, (c) dancing with death, (d) relearning to dance, and (e) role of the dance partner. CONCLUSIONS:The experience of living with CF as an adult is multidimensional and unique to each person. Despite the uniqueness, there is a shared experience that manifested as The Dance of Cystic Fibrosis. As life expectancy continues to increase for persons with CF, it is essential that researchers and healthcare professionals intentionally consider the life-prolonging effects of the treatment regimen alongside the persons' experience with those effects. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE:Nurses at all levels of practice should be prepared to address the multifaceted experience of living with CF through thoughtful incorporation of open-ended questions. This allows patients to share their experience with nurses, augmenting their practice of delivering holistic care.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "6   BACKGROUND:Malabsorption and deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins K may occur in cystic fibrosis, a genetic disorder affecting multiple organs. Vitamin K is known to play an important role in both blood coagulation and bone formation, hence the role of supplementation of vitamin K in this category needs to be reviewed. This is an updated version of the review. OBJECTIVES:To assess the effects of vitamin K supplementation in people with cystic fibrosis and to investigate the hypotheses that vitamin K will decrease deficiency-related coagulopathy, increase bone mineral density, decrease risk of fractures and improve quality of life in people with CF. Also to determine the optimal dose and route of administration of vitamin K for people with CF (for both routine and therapeutic use). SEARCH METHODS:We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Most recent search: 12 August 2019. SELECTION CRITERIA:Randomised controlled trials of all preparations of vitamin K used as a supplement compared to either no supplementation (or placebo) at any dose or route and for any duration, in patients with cystic fibrosis. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS:Two authors independently screened papers, extracted trial details and assessed their risk of bias. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE criteria. MAIN RESULTS:Three trials (total 70 participants, aged 8 to 46 years) assessed as having a moderate risk of bias were included. One trial compared vitamin K to placebo, a second to no supplementation and the third compared two doses of vitamin K. No trial in either comparison reported our primary outcomes of coagulation and quality of life or the secondary outcomes of nutritional parameters and adverse events. Vitamin K versus control Two trials compared vitamin K to control, but data were not available for analysis. One 12-month trial (n = 38) compared 10 mg vitamin K daily or placebo in a parallel design and one trial (n = 18) was of cross-over design with no washout period and compared 5 mg vitamin K/week for four-weeks to no supplementation for four-weeks. Only the 12-month trial reported on the primary outcome of bone formation; we are very uncertain whether vitamin K supplementation has any effect on bone mineral density at the femoral hip or lumbar spine (very low-quality evidence). Both trials reported an increase in serum vitamin K levels and a decrease in undercarboxylated osteocalcin levels. The cross-over trial also reported that levels of proteins induced by vitamin K absence (PIVKA) showed a decrease and a return to normal following supplementation, but due to the very low-quality evidence we are not certain that this is due to the intervention. High-dose versus low-dose vitamin K One parallel trial (n = 14) compared 1 mg vitamin K/day to 5 mg vitamin K/day for four weeks. The trial did report that there did not appear to be any difference in serum undercarboxylated osteocalcin or vitamin K levels (very low-quality evidence). While the trial reported that serum vitamin K levels improved with supplementation, there was no difference between the high-dose and low-dose groups. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS:There is very low-quality evidence of any effect of vitamin K in people with cystic fibrosis. While there is no evidence of harm, until better evidence is available the ongoing recommendations by national CF guidelines should be followed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "14  BACKGROUND:Cystic fibrosis is a multi-system disease characterised by the production of thick secretions causing recurrent pulmonary infection, often with unusual bacteria. This leads to lung destruction and eventually death through respiratory failure. There are no antibiotics in development that exert a new mode of action and many of the current antibiotics are ineffective in eradicating the bacteria once chronic infection is established. Antibiotic adjuvants - therapies that act by rendering the organism more susceptible to attack by antibiotics or the host immune system, by rendering it less virulent or killing it by other means, would be a significant therapeutic advance. This is an update of a previously published review. OBJECTIVES:To determine if antibiotic adjuvants improve clinical and microbiological outcome of pulmonary infection in people with cystic fibrosis. SEARCH METHODS:We searched the Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register which is compiled from database searches, hand searches of appropriate journals and conference proceedings. Date of most recent search: 16 January 2020. We also searched MEDLINE (all years) on 14 February 2019 and ongoing trials registers on 06 April 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA:Randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised controlled trials of a therapy exerting an antibiotic adjuvant mechanism of action compared to placebo or no therapy for people with cystic fibrosis. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS:Two of the authors independently assessed and extracted data from identified trials. MAIN RESULTS:We identified 42 trials of which eight (350 participants) that examined antibiotic adjuvant therapies are included. Two further trials are ongoing and five are awaiting classification. The included trials assessed β-carotene (one trial, 24 participants), garlic (one trial, 34 participants), KB001-A (a monoclonal antibody) (two trials, 196 participants), nitric oxide (two trials, 30 participants) and zinc supplementation (two trials, 66 participants). The zinc trials recruited children only, whereas the remaining trials recruited both adults and children. Three trials were located in Europe, one in Asia and four in the USA. Three of the interventions measured our primary outcome of pulmonary exacerbations (β-carotene, mean difference (MD) -8.00 (95% confidence interval (CI) -18.78 to 2.78); KB001-A, risk ratio (RR) 0.25 (95% CI 0.03 to 2.40); zinc supplementation, RR 1.85 (95% CI 0.65 to 5.26). β-carotene and KB001-A may make little or no difference to the number of exacerbations experienced (low-quality evidence); whereas, given the moderate-quality evidence we found that zinc probably makes no difference to this outcome. Respiratory function was measured in all of the included trials. β-carotene and nitric oxide may make little or no difference to forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) (low-quality evidence), whilst garlic probably makes little or no difference to FEV1 (moderate-quality evidence). It is uncertain whether zinc or KB001-A improve FEV1 as the certainty of this evidence is very low. Few adverse events were seen across all of the different interventions and the adverse events that were reported were mild or not treatment-related (quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate). One of the trials (169 participants) comparing KB001-A and placebo, reported on the time to the next course of antibiotics; results showed there is probably no difference between groups, HR 1.00 (95% CI 0.69 to 1.45) (moderate-quality evidence). Quality of life was only reported in the two KB001-A trials, which demonstrated that there may be little or no difference between KB001-A and placebo (low-quality evidence). Sputum microbiology was measured and reported for the trials of KB001-A and nitric oxide (four trials). There was very low-quality evidence of a numerical reduction in Pseudomonas aeruginosa density with KB001-A, but it was not significant. The two trials looking at the effects of nitric oxide reported significant reductions in Staphylococcus aureus and near-significant reductions in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but the quality of this evidence is again very low. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS:We could not identify an antibiotic adjuvant therapy that we could recommend for treating of lung infection in people with cystic fibrosis. The emergence of increasingly resistant bacteria makes the reliance on antibiotics alone challenging for cystic fibrosis teams. There is a need to explore alternative strategies, such as the use of adjuvant therapies. Further research is required to provide future therapeutic options.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "9   BACKGROUND:Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) do not respond with increased urinary HCO3 - excretion after stimulation with secretin and often present with metabolic alkalosis. METHODS:By combining RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, isolated tubule perfusion, in vitro cell studies, and in vivo studies in different mouse models, we elucidated the mechanism of secretin-induced urinary HCO3 - excretion. For CF patients and CF mice, we developed a HCO3 - drinking test to assess the role of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in urinary HCO3 -excretion and applied it in the patients before and after treatment with the novel CFTR modulator drug, lumacaftor-ivacaftor. RESULTS:β-Intercalated cells express basolateral secretin receptors and apical CFTR and pendrin. In vivo application of secretin induced a marked urinary alkalization, an effect absent in mice lacking pendrin or CFTR. In perfused cortical collecting ducts, secretin stimulated pendrin-dependent Cl-/HCO3 - exchange. In collecting ducts in CFTR knockout mice, baseline pendrin activity was significantly lower and not responsive to secretin. Notably, patients with CF (F508del/F508del) and CF mice showed a greatly attenuated or absent urinary HCO3 --excreting ability. In patients, treatment with the CFTR modulator drug lumacaftor-ivacaftor increased the renal ability to excrete HCO3 -. CONCLUSIONS:These results define the mechanism of secretin-induced urinary HCO3 - excretion, explain metabolic alkalosis in patients with CF, and suggest feasibility of an in vivo human CF urine test to validate drug efficacy.

       "11  BACKGROUND:General movements (GMs) in infants occur as fidgety movements (FMs) between postterm 9 and 20 weeks. We aimed to evaluate FMs and motor repertoire in infants with cystic fibrosis (CF) and their relation with clinical findings. METHODS:Demographic and clinical characteristics were recorded. FMs and motor repertoire were analyzed from a 5-min video recording of each infant. Videos were rated based on the Prechtl General Movement Assessment and motor optimality score (MOS) was calculated. RESULTS:The analysis included 18 infants with CF and 20 healthy infants at postterm age of 3-5 months. MOS was significantly lower in the infants with CF compared to controls (p < 0.05). Fifty percent of the infants with CF had abnormal or absent/sporadic FMs. MOS was negatively associated with hospitalization duration (r = -0.378, p = 0.036); and positively associated with vitamin A level in CF infants (r = 0.665, p = 0.026). CONCLUSIONS:Infants with genetically anticipated severe CF phenotype tended to have lower MOS. MOS may be used in addition to genetic testing to predict disease severity in infants with CF. Infants with CF, absent/sporadic FMs, and lower MOS could be considered for planning specific age-adequate early intervention programs. IMPACT:Motor repertoire was age-inadequate in infants with cystic fibrosis (CF).50% of infants with CF had abnormal or absent/sporadic fidgety movements (FMs).Motor optimality score (MOS) was positively associated with vitamin A level and negatively correlated with hospitalization duration in infants with CF.MOS tended to decrease as genetically anticipated disease severity increased; thus, MOS might enable us to predict disease severity in CF. The relationship between motor repertoire and phenotype and genotype is unclear and warrants further study.CF infants with absent/sporadic FMs, and lower MOS could be considered for planning early intervention.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

The prevalence and significance of such abnormalities in classical (cEDS) or hypermobile EDS (hEDS) remain unclear. We report the prevalence of cardiac abnormalities in patients with cEDS and hEDS. METHODS:We identified 532 pediatric patients with potential EDS evaluated at our institution from January 2014 through April 2019 by retrospective chart review. Ninety-five patients (12 cEDS and 83 hEDS patients) met 2017 EDS diagnostic criteria and had an echocardiogram. One patient was excluded due to complex congenital heart disease, and two were excluded due to lack of images. We reviewed echocardiograms for all structural abnormalities. RESULTS:Of these 95 patients, 1 had mild aortic root dilation, and 1 had mild ascending aorta dilation in the setting of a bicuspid aortic valve. Eleven patients (11.6%) had a cardiac valve abnormality, all of which were trivial to mild. None of the patients required cardiac intervention. CONCLUSION:Our results demonstrate that aortic dilation and valvular anomalies are uncommon in cEDS or hEDS patients. Given the lack of evidence, we do not recommend echocardiographic evaluation and surveillance in patients with cEDS and hEDS in the absence of clinical findings or positive family history.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Ehlers-Danlos Syndromes (EDS) are a group of heritable disorders of connective tissue (HDCT) characterized by joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility, and tissue fragility. Orthostatic intolerance (OI) is highly prevalent in EDS however mechanisms linking OI to EDS remain poorly understood. We hypothesize that impaired blood pressure (BP) and heart rate control is associated with lower arterial stiffness in people with EDS. Orthostatic vital signs and arterial stiffness were assessed in a cohort of 60 people with EDS (49 female, 36 ± 16 years). Arterial elasticity was assessed by central and peripheral pulse wave velocity (PWV). Central PWV was lower in people with EDS compared to reference values in healthy subjects. In participants with EDS, central PWV was correlated to supine systolic BP (r = 0.387, p = 0.002), supine diastolic BP (r = 0.400, p = 0.002), and seated systolic BP (r = 0.399, p = 0.002). There were no significant correlations between PWV and changes in BP or heart rate with standing (p &gt; 0.05). Between EDS types, there were no differences in supine hemodynamics or PWV measures (p &gt; 0.05). These data demonstrate that increased arterial elasticity is associated with lower BP in people with EDS which may contribute to orthostatic symptoms and potentially provides a quantitative clinical measure for future genotype-phenotype investigations.</td>\n",

       "      <td>PURPOSE:Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) is an inherited connective tissue disorder caused by abnormal collagen synthesis. Little is known about its effects on pregnancy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the pregnancy outcomes in women with EDS. MATERIALS AND METHODS:We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study using the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Nationwide Inpatient Sample database from the United States. The study included women who delivered between 1999 and 2014. We measured the prevalence of EDS over time, and compared the baseline, obstetrical, and neonatal outcomes among women with EDS to the general obstetrical population without EDS. Unconditional logistic regression models were used to calculate the adjusted effect of EDS on maternal and neonatal outcomes. RESULTS:The overall prevalence of EDS in pregnancy was 7 per 100,000 births, with the trend increasing over the 16 year study period (p &lt; .0001). Women with EDS were more likely to be Caucasian, belong to a higher income quartile, and smoke. Pregnancies in women with EDS were associated with prematurity, 1.47 (1.18-1.82), cervical incompetence, 3.11 (1.99-4.85), antepartum hemorrhage, 1.71 (1.16-2.50), placenta previa, 2.26 (1.35-3.77) and maternal death, 9.04 (1.27-64.27). Pregnant women with EDS were more likely to be delivered by cesarean section, 1.55 (1.36-1.76), have longer postpartum stays (&gt;7 days), 2.82 (2.08-3.85), and have a neonate with intra-uterine growth restriction, 1.81 (1.29-2.54). CONCLUSIONS:EDS in pregnancy is a high-risk condition with increased maternal morbidity and mortality, as well as newborn morbidity. Consideration should be given to prematurity preventative measures and high-risk pregnancy consultation.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) are a group of inherited connective tissue disorders characterized by joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility, and variable tissue fragility. However, there are limited published data on the dental manifestations of EDS. This review systematically assessed the spectrum of published dental anomalies in various types of EDS. Twenty-four individual case reports/series and 3 longer case-control studies, reporting on a total of 84 individuals with a clinical diagnosis of EDS, were included in the data analysis. The main dental features listed in classical EDS were pulp calcification and localized root hypoplasia. Common dental abnormalities observed in vascular EDS were pulp shape modifications (52.2%), exceeding root length (34.8%), and molar root fusion (47.8%). Dentinogenesis imperfecta is a consistent finding in osteogenesis imperfecta/EDS overlap syndrome. Data on dental manifestations in other types of EDS are both rare and generally inconclusive.</td>\n",

However, there are only two previously published cases of synovial metaplasia in EDS. We present a third case in a 56-year-old woman with painful redundant skin in both elbows and knees for whom a skin fold of the left elbow was removed to relieve her symptoms. The biopsy showed preservation of the elastic and collagen fibers. The main alteration was the evidence of dermal cystic spaces lined by fibrinoid rests with focal pseudopapillary projections. However, in some zones the cellular lining was preserved, and it was composed of vimentin-positive, fibroblast-like flat, elongated cells, as well as CD68-positive macrophages. No birefringent particles were found in an examination under polarized light.</td>\n",

       "      <td>BACKGROUND:The Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) are a group of connective tissue disorders with several recognised types. Patients with a type of EDS have connective tissue abnormalities resulting in a varying degree of joint hypermobility, skin and vascular fragility and generalised tissue friability. Classical EDS (cEDS) typically occurs as a result of dominant pathogenic variants in COL5A1 or COL5A2. The cardinal features of cEDS are hyperextensible skin, atrophic scarring and joint hypermobility. Arterial complications are more characteristically a feature of vascular EDS although individual cases of arterial events in cEDS have been reported. METHODS:A cohort of 154 patients with a clinical diagnosis of cEDS from the UK was analysed. RESULTS:Seven patients (4.5%) with a diagnosis of cEDS (four pathogenic, one likely pathogenic and two variants of uncertain significance in COL5A1) who had experienced arterial complications were identified. Arterial complications mostly involved medium-sized vessels and also two abdominal aortic aneurysms. No unique clinical features were identified in this group of patients. CONCLUSION:There is a possible increased risk of arterial complications in patients with cEDS, although not well-defined. Clinicians need to be aware of this possibility when presented with a patient with an arterial complication and features of cEDS. Long-term management in families with cEDS and a vascular complication should be individually tailored to the patient's history and their family's history of vascular events.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) are a group of heritable connective tissue disorders (HCTDs) characterized by a variable degree of skin hyperextensibility, joint hypermobility and tissue fragility. The current EDS classification distinguishes 13 subtypes and 19 different causal genes mainly involved in collagen and extracellular matrix synthesis and maintenance. EDS need to be differentiated from other HCTDs with a variable clinical overlap including Marfan syndrome and related disorders, some types of skeletal dysplasia and cutis laxa. Clinical recognition of EDS is not always straightforward and for a definite diagnosis, molecular testing can be of great assistance, especially in patients with an uncertain phenotype. Currently, the major challenging task in EDS is to unravel the molecular basis of the hypermobile EDS that is the most frequent form, and for which the diagnosis is only clinical in the absence of any definite laboratory test. This EDS subtype, as well as other EDS-reminiscent phenotypes, are currently investigated worldwide to unravel the primary genetic defect and related pathomechanisms. The research articles, case report, and reviews published in this Special Issue focus on different clinical, genetic and molecular aspects of several EDS subtypes and some related disorders, offering novel findings and future research and nosological perspectives.</td>\n",

A comprehensive national review encompassing all hospitalizations for the Marfan Syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome patient population is lacking. METHODS:The National (Nationwide) Inpatient Sample from 2010 to 2014 was reviewed for all inpatient vascular surgery procedures including those with a diagnosis of Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. National estimates of vascular surgery rates were generated from provided weights. Patient demographics, procedure type, and outcomes were assessed. RESULTS:There were 3103 Marfan syndrome and 476 Ehlers-Danlos syndrome vascular procedures identified as well as 3,895,381 vascular procedures in the remainder of population (control group). The percent of aortic procedures from all vascular procedures in Marfan syndrome (23.5%) and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (23.5%) were 2.5-fold higher than controls (9.1%), p &lt; 0.0001. Open aortic aneurysm repair was also significantly greater in both Marfan syndrome (16.8%) and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (11.2%) compared to controls (4.4%), p &lt; 0.0001. Endovascular aortic repair (p &lt; 0.2302) was similar among the groups. Marfan syndrome (7.7%) and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (5.1%) had more thoracic endovascular aortic repair performed than controls (0.7%), p &lt; 0.0001. Percutaneous procedures were fewer in Marfan syndrome (6.3%) than controls (31.3%) and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (26.3%), p &lt; 0.0001, while repair of peripheral arteries was greater in Marfan syndrome (5.9%) and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (4.1%) than controls (1.5%), p &lt; 0.0001. For total aortic procedures, the mean age of aortic procedures was 68.2 years in controls vs 45.8 years in Marfan syndrome and 55.3 years in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, p &lt; 0.0001. Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome had fewer comorbidities overall, while controls had significantly higher rates of coronary artery disease (controls 39.9% vs Marfan syndrome 8.3% and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome 13.0%, p &lt; 0.0001), peripheral vascular disease (controls 34.5% vs Marfan syndrome 4.2% and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome 8.7%, p &lt; 0.0001), and diabetes (controls 20.6% vs Marfan syndrome 6.6 and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome 4.4%, p &lt; 0.0001). Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome had higher overall complication rate (65.5% and 52.2%) compared to controls (44.6%), p &lt; 0.0001. Postoperative hemorrhage was more likely in Marfan syndrome (42.9%) and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (39.1%) than controls (22.2%), p &lt; 0.0001. Increased respiratory failure was noted in Marfan syndrome (20.2%) vs controls (10.7%) and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (8.7%), p = .0003. Finally, length of stay was increased in Marfan syndrome 12.5 days vs Ehlers-Danlos syndrome 7.4 days and controls 7.2 days (p &lt; 0.0001) as well as a higher median costs of index hospitalization in Marfan syndrome ($57,084 vs Ehlers-Danlos syndrome $22,032 and controls $26,520, p &lt; 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS:Patients with Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome differ from other patients undergoing vascular surgical procedures, with a significantly higher proportion of aortic procedures including open aneurysm repair and thoracic endovascular aortic repair. While they are younger with fewer comorbidities, due to the unique pathogenesis of their underlying connective tissue disorder, there is an overall higher rate of procedural complications and increased length of stay and cost for Marfan syndrome patients undergoing aortic surgery.</td>\n",

       "      <td>BACKGROUND:Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is a multifaceted disease that can present with a variety of types of pain. Unfortunately, both the mechanisms and treatments for pain are poorly understood. The proposed treatments for the various musculoskeletal pain syndromes in EDS have had variable success, and it becomes much more imperative to better define and evaluate the current treatment modalities in treating this debilitating disease. OBJECTIVES:The purpose of this study was to investigate the currently available treatment modalities for patients with EDS and their efficacies in pain and symptom relief. STUDY DESIGN:Retrospective cohort study. SETTING:Institutional physical medicine and rehabilitation primary care clinic. METHODS:All patients were seen between January 2015 and April 2019, in which 98 patients with EDS were identified through retrospective chart review. Institutional review board approval was obtained, and all patients provided written consent to be included in the study. We reviewed various treatment modalities, including complimentary/alternative treatments, opioids/opioid-like medications, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, physical therapy, occupational therapy, muscle relaxants, neuropathic modulators, steroids, surgery/procedures, and acetaminophen. Treatment methods were extracted from individual patient charts, and efficacy was grouped into 3 categories: improvement, no effect, or worsened symptoms. RESULTS:The most common treatments used were complimentary/alternative treatments (n = 88). Occupational therapy and bracing were the most effective options with 70% of patients reporting improvement. Neuropathic modulators were the least well tolerated with 47% of patients reporting adverse effects. LIMITATIONS:Men were a small percentage of the study. Patients were not randomized, and pain score reporting was subjective. Patient data were extracted from a single practice setting. Timing and symptom onset were not measured. CONCLUSIONS:There is a relative paucity of published literature regarding the various treatment methods for EDS. Although our study is able to identify positive and negative trends with certain modalities, it is vital to understand that EDS is not a uniform diagnosis among patients, and that a combination of several different treatments usually is needed for optimal symptom control. Further research and investigation are necessary to develop a comprehensive treatment database for this complex condition.

RECENT FINDINGS:Low bone mineral density and fractures seem to be frequent in some of the rare EDS types (kyphoscoliotic, arthrochalasia, spondylodysplastic, and classic-like EDS). For the more prevalent hypermobile and classic EDS types, some case-control studies found mildly decreased bone mineral density, but it was not clear that fracture rates were increased. Nevertheless, abnormalities in vertebral shape seem to be common in classical and hypermobile EDS types. In a cohort of individuals with EDS followed since birth, no fractures were observed during infancy. Bone mineral density varies widely among the different types of EDS, and vertebral abnormalities seem to be common in classical and hypermobile EDS. It might be justified to perform spine radiographs and bone mineral density assessments in newly diagnosed EDS.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is a connective tissue disorder characterized by joint hypermobility and skin extensibility and is often accompanied by chronic pain. Rhythmic sensory stimulation (RSS) can be defined as the stimulation of the senses in a periodic manner within a range of low frequencies. Music plus sound delivered through a vibroacoustic device is a form of RSS and has demonstrated utility in managing pain. In this current study, we conducted an open-label pilot study of 15 patients with hypermobile EDS using RSS as the intervention. Posttreatment improvements were seen in 11 of the 15 patients (73%), whereas 3 of the 15 patients (20%) experienced worse outcomes. Of the 14 patients that completed the experiment, 6 participants (43%) were classified as \"responders\" to the device while 8 participants (57%) were classified as \"nonresponders.\" Responders demonstrated significant improvements in pain interference (51.5 ± 16 preintervention vs. 43.5 ± 16.4 postintervention BPI score) and depression symptoms (34.0 ± 15.9 preintervention vs. 26.8 ± 12.1 postintervention CESD score). Poststudy interviews confirm the improvements of pain interference, mood, and bowel symptoms. Furthermore, analysis of medical conditions within the responder group indicates that the presence of depression, anxiety, irritable bowel syndrome, and fibromyalgia may indicate a greater likelihood for patients to benefit with vibroacoustic applications. These results indicate a possible potential for RSS, delivered using a vibroacoustic device, in managing pain-related symptoms. Further research is necessary to elucidate the exact mechanism behind the physiological benefits of RSS.</td>\n",

       "      <td>BACKGROUND:Patients with vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) occasionally suffer from arterial dissection. Eagle syndrome, which is caused by an elongated styloid process and also causes arterial dissection, is difficult to diagnose and could sometimes be overlooked. Little is known of the coexistence of these two diseases, and treatment strategy is not established. Here, we present a case of bilateral internal carotid artery (ICA) dissection due to Eagle syndrome in a patient with vascular EDS. CASE PRESENTATION:A 30-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of sudden onset of mild sensory disturbance in his left limbs. He had a history of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) and also had left cervical internal carotid artery (ICA) dissection 3 years before. Diffusion-weighted imaging showed acute cerebral infarcts in the right hemisphere. Cervical computed tomography angiography (CTA) revealed the right ICA narrowing at the cervical portion in addition to the previous left cervical ICA dissection. Cervical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed double-lumen and intramural hematoma at the narrowing portion of the right cervical ICA, which indicates arterial dissection. CT also revealed bilateral elongated styloid processes which are close to each side of cervical ICA. We diagnosed him as bilateral ICA dissection due to bilateral Eagle syndrome. Considering vascular complications due to vascular EDS, we performed closer follow-up with transoral carotid ultrasonography (TOCU). In 4 months, his right ICA dissection gradually improved without stroke recurrence or deterioration of dissection. CONCLUSIONS:Since patients with vascular EDS easily develop arterial dissection, Eagle syndrome may be overlooked. Clinicians should consider Eagle syndrome in the case of vascular EDS with extracranial ICA dissection and close follow-up should be prioritized in cases of Eagle syndrome with vascular EDS.</td>\n",

Although ophthalmic conditions associated with EDS have been described, little data exist concerning ophthalmic surgical outcomes experienced by EDS patients. METHODS:Patients with EDS were surveyed via the EDS Society and asked about their ophthalmic surgical experiences including procedure, complications, and the timing with respect to receiving the EDS diagnosis. Complications were confirmed as such by subspecialists. RESULTS:Of 579 respondents, 467 reported confirmed EDS, and 112 of those had an ophthalmic procedure, including refractive surgery, cataract/lens surgery, retinal surgery, strabismus surgery, oculoplastic surgery, corneal surgery, and laser surgery for glaucoma. The rate of confirmed complications was: 23%-refractive, 33%-lens/cataract, 33%-retina, 59%-strabismus, 23%- oculoplastics, 0%-cornea, and 25%-glaucoma laser. In addition, 76% of patients underwent surgery prior to the EDS diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS:Patients with EDS may have elevated risk of postoperative ophthalmic surgical complications. It would seem reasonable to systemically and prospectively explore how patients with EDS respond to ophthalmic surgery. Furthermore, it would seem circumspect to ask surgical candidates patients about whether they carry a diagnosis of EDS or have signs and symptoms of EDS prior to surgery.</td>\n",

OBJECTIVE:To report the cases of patients with EDS and severe obesity that underwent bariatric surgery. SETTING:Five French hospitals (University Hospital of Nantes, APHP Pitié Salpêtrière Hospital, APHP Bichat Hospital, Clinique St Gregoire Rennes, and Clinique Mutualiste de l'Estuaire St Nazaire). METHODS:We report the cases of 7 patients with EDS and severe obesity who underwent surgery. RESULTS:All patients showed classical postoperative course except for 1 case of excessive bleeding. There was no increased pain, leak, and solid parietal healing was achieved in all patients at 1 month postoperatively. The percent excess weight loss at 1 and 6 months were 13.9 ± 3.8% and 45.3 ± 16%, respectively.

Allograft reconstruction of the shoulder capsule in EDS has the potential to increase stability by providing healthier connective tissue. The purpose of this study was to report the surgical technique and outcome of open capsulorraphy and augmentation of the anterior capsule with Achilles tendon allograft in patients with shoulder instability in the setting of EDS. METHODS:Five shoulders (4 patients) with EDS and severe anteroinferior or multidirectional instability underwent open capsular shift combined with Achilles allograft augmentation of the anterior capsule. Patients were evaluated for pain, motion, recurrent instability, subjective shoulder value (SSV), ASES score, complications and reoperations. The mean follow-up time was 3.6 years (range, 2 to 5 years). RESULTS:Shoulder stability was restored in 4 of 5 (80%) shoulders. At final follow-up, the mean SSV and ASES scores were 84 and 77.3, respectively. One shoulder developed recurrent posterior instability after an injury 1.6 years after the index procedure. The mean pain VAS was 7 preoperatively and 2 at most recent follow-up. Before surgery, all patients reported use of narcotic pain medication, whereas at most recent follow-up only the one patient who had experienced recurrence reported moderate pain. Except for the shoulder that required revision surgery for posterior shoulder instability, there were no complications or other reoperations. CONCLUSION:Open capsulorraphy with Achilles Allograft augmentation improved stability and pain 4 of 5 shoulders with instability in the setting of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. In this small case series of EDS patients, Achilles tendon allograft augmentation was safe and effective as a primary or revision surgical procedure for anterior shoulder instability. A larger patient cohort with longer follow-up is needed to confirm these findings. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE:Level IV; Case Series; Treatment Study.</td>\n",

       "6   PURPOSE:Cardiac-valvular and vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) have significant cardiovascular issues. The prevalence and significance of such abnormalities in classical (cEDS) or hypermobile EDS (hEDS) remain unclear. We report the prevalence of cardiac abnormalities in patients with cEDS and hEDS. METHODS:We identified 532 pediatric patients with potential EDS evaluated at our institution from January 2014 through April 2019 by retrospective chart review. Ninety-five patients (12 cEDS and 83 hEDS patients) met 2017 EDS diagnostic criteria and had an echocardiogram. One patient was excluded due to complex congenital heart disease, and two were excluded due to lack of images. We reviewed echocardiograms for all structural abnormalities. RESULTS:Of these 95 patients, 1 had mild aortic root dilation, and 1 had mild ascending aorta dilation in the setting of a bicuspid aortic valve. Eleven patients (11.6%) had a cardiac valve abnormality, all of which were trivial to mild. None of the patients required cardiac intervention. CONCLUSION:Our results demonstrate that aortic dilation and valvular anomalies are uncommon in cEDS or hEDS patients. Given the lack of evidence, we do not recommend echocardiographic evaluation and surveillance in patients with cEDS and hEDS in the absence of clinical findings or positive family history.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "13  Ehlers-Danlos Syndromes (EDS) are a group of heritable disorders of connective tissue (HDCT) characterized by joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility, and tissue fragility. Orthostatic intolerance (OI) is highly prevalent in EDS however mechanisms linking OI to EDS remain poorly understood. We hypothesize that impaired blood pressure (BP) and heart rate control is associated with lower arterial stiffness in people with EDS. Orthostatic vital signs and arterial stiffness were assessed in a cohort of 60 people with EDS (49 female, 36 ± 16 years). Arterial elasticity was assessed by central and peripheral pulse wave velocity (PWV). Central PWV was lower in people with EDS compared to reference values in healthy subjects. In participants with EDS, central PWV was correlated to supine systolic BP (r = 0.387, p = 0.002), supine diastolic BP (r = 0.400, p = 0.002), and seated systolic BP (r = 0.399, p = 0.002). There were no significant correlations between PWV and changes in BP or heart rate with standing (p > 0.05). Between EDS types, there were no differences in supine hemodynamics or PWV measures (p > 0.05). These data demonstrate that increased arterial elasticity is associated with lower BP in people with EDS which may contribute to orthostatic symptoms and potentially provides a quantitative clinical measure for future genotype-phenotype investigations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "0   PURPOSE:Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) is an inherited connective tissue disorder caused by abnormal collagen synthesis. Little is known about its effects on pregnancy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the pregnancy outcomes in women with EDS. MATERIALS AND METHODS:We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study using the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Nationwide Inpatient Sample database from the United States. The study included women who delivered between 1999 and 2014. We measured the prevalence of EDS over time, and compared the baseline, obstetrical, and neonatal outcomes among women with EDS to the general obstetrical population without EDS. Unconditional logistic regression models were used to calculate the adjusted effect of EDS on maternal and neonatal outcomes. RESULTS:The overall prevalence of EDS in pregnancy was 7 per 100,000 births, with the trend increasing over the 16 year study period (p < .0001). Women with EDS were more likely to be Caucasian, belong to a higher income quartile, and smoke. Pregnancies in women with EDS were associated with prematurity, 1.47 (1.18-1.82), cervical incompetence, 3.11 (1.99-4.85), antepartum hemorrhage, 1.71 (1.16-2.50), placenta previa, 2.26 (1.35-3.77) and maternal death, 9.04 (1.27-64.27). Pregnant women with EDS were more likely to be delivered by cesarean section, 1.55 (1.36-1.76), have longer postpartum stays (>7 days), 2.82 (2.08-3.85), and have a neonate with intra-uterine growth restriction, 1.81 (1.29-2.54). CONCLUSIONS:EDS in pregnancy is a high-risk condition with increased maternal morbidity and mortality, as well as newborn morbidity. Consideration should be given to prematurity preventative measures and high-risk pregnancy consultation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "5   Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) are a group of inherited connective tissue disorders characterized by joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility, and variable tissue fragility. However, there are limited published data on the dental manifestations of EDS. This review systematically assessed the spectrum of published dental anomalies in various types of EDS. Twenty-four individual case reports/series and 3 longer case-control studies, reporting on a total of 84 individuals with a clinical diagnosis of EDS, were included in the data analysis. The main dental features listed in classical EDS were pulp calcification and localized root hypoplasia. Common dental abnormalities observed in vascular EDS were pulp shape modifications (52.2%), exceeding root length (34.8%), and molar root fusion (47.8%). Dentinogenesis imperfecta is a consistent finding in osteogenesis imperfecta/EDS overlap syndrome. Data on dental manifestations in other types of EDS are both rare and generally inconclusive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "17  Of the 13 subtypes of Ehlers-Danlos Syndromes (EDSs) identified in the 2017 international classification of EDSs, 12 have a recognized, associated genetic mutation. However, hypermobile EDS (hEDS) currently has no identifiable associated gene. Therefore, patients with hEDS are identified through a set of clinical diagnosis guidelines and criteria, which are meant to differentiate hEDS from other hypermobile joint conditions and other EDSs subtypes. In this article, the authors provide an overview of hEDS symptoms and comborbidities, current treatment options, and the clinical criteria currently guiding the standard of care.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "10  Classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is a connective tissue disorder characterized by laxity. The skin, as one of the organs involved, shows hyperextensibility, which makes it prone to trauma. In this context, it would seem logical for cutaneous synovial metaplasia, which is considered a form of repair, to be commonly found in cases of EDS. However, there are only two previously published cases of synovial metaplasia in EDS. We present a third case in a 56-year-old woman with painful redundant skin in both elbows and knees for whom a skin fold of the left elbow was removed to relieve her symptoms. The biopsy showed preservation of the elastic and collagen fibers. The main alteration was the evidence of dermal cystic spaces lined by fibrinoid rests with focal pseudopapillary projections. However, in some zones the cellular lining was preserved, and it was composed of vimentin-positive, fibroblast-like flat, elongated cells, as well as CD68-positive macrophages. No birefringent particles were found in an examination under polarized light.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "12  BACKGROUND:The Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) are a group of connective tissue disorders with several recognised types. Patients with a type of EDS have connective tissue abnormalities resulting in a varying degree of joint hypermobility, skin and vascular fragility and generalised tissue friability. Classical EDS (cEDS) typically occurs as a result of dominant pathogenic variants in COL5A1 or COL5A2. The cardinal features of cEDS are hyperextensible skin, atrophic scarring and joint hypermobility. Arterial complications are more characteristically a feature of vascular EDS although individual cases of arterial events in cEDS have been reported. METHODS:A cohort of 154 patients with a clinical diagnosis of cEDS from the UK was analysed. RESULTS:Seven patients (4.5%) with a diagnosis of cEDS (four pathogenic, one likely pathogenic and two variants of uncertain significance in COL5A1) who had experienced arterial complications were identified. Arterial complications mostly involved medium-sized vessels and also two abdominal aortic aneurysms. No unique clinical features were identified in this group of patients. CONCLUSION:There is a possible increased risk of arterial complications in patients with cEDS, although not well-defined. Clinicians need to be aware of this possibility when presented with a patient with an arterial complication and features of cEDS. Long-term management in families with cEDS and a vascular complication should be individually tailored to the patient's history and their family's history of vascular events.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "8   Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) are a group of heritable connective tissue disorders (HCTDs) characterized by a variable degree of skin hyperextensibility, joint hypermobility and tissue fragility. The current EDS classification distinguishes 13 subtypes and 19 different causal genes mainly involved in collagen and extracellular matrix synthesis and maintenance. EDS need to be differentiated from other HCTDs with a variable clinical overlap including Marfan syndrome and related disorders, some types of skeletal dysplasia and cutis laxa. Clinical recognition of EDS is not always straightforward and for a definite diagnosis, molecular testing can be of great assistance, especially in patients with an uncertain phenotype. Currently, the major challenging task in EDS is to unravel the molecular basis of the hypermobile EDS that is the most frequent form, and for which the diagnosis is only clinical in the absence of any definite laboratory test. This EDS subtype, as well as other EDS-reminiscent phenotypes, are currently investigated worldwide to unravel the primary genetic defect and related pathomechanisms. The research articles, case report, and reviews published in this Special Issue focus on different clinical, genetic and molecular aspects of several EDS subtypes and some related disorders, offering novel findings and future research and nosological perspectives.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "1   Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) describes a group of heritable disorders of connective tissue comprising mutations in the genes involved in the structure and/or biosynthesis of collagen. Thirteen EDS subtypes are recognized, with a wide degree of symptom overlap among subtypes and with other connective tissue disorders.

       "11  OBJECTIVES:Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome represent two connective tissue vascular diseases requiring unique consideration in their vascular surgical care. A comprehensive national review encompassing all hospitalizations for the Marfan Syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome patient population is lacking. METHODS:The National (Nationwide) Inpatient Sample from 2010 to 2014 was reviewed for all inpatient vascular surgery procedures including those with a diagnosis of Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. National estimates of vascular surgery rates were generated from provided weights. Patient demographics, procedure type, and outcomes were assessed. RESULTS:There were 3103 Marfan syndrome and 476 Ehlers-Danlos syndrome vascular procedures identified as well as 3,895,381 vascular procedures in the remainder of population (control group). The percent of aortic procedures from all vascular procedures in Marfan syndrome (23.5%) and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (23.5%) were 2.5-fold higher than controls (9.1%), p < 0.0001. Open aortic aneurysm repair was also significantly greater in both Marfan syndrome (16.8%) and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (11.2%) compared to controls (4.4%), p < 0.0001. Endovascular aortic repair (p < 0.2302) was similar among the groups. Marfan syndrome (7.7%) and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (5.1%) had more thoracic endovascular aortic repair performed than controls (0.7%), p < 0.0001. Percutaneous procedures were fewer in Marfan syndrome (6.3%) than controls (31.3%) and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (26.3%), p < 0.0001, while repair of peripheral arteries was greater in Marfan syndrome (5.9%) and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (4.1%) than controls (1.5%), p < 0.0001. For total aortic procedures, the mean age of aortic procedures was 68.2 years in controls vs 45.8 years in Marfan syndrome and 55.3 years in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, p < 0.0001. Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome had fewer comorbidities overall, while controls had significantly higher rates of coronary artery disease (controls 39.9% vs Marfan syndrome 8.3% and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome 13.0%, p < 0.0001), peripheral vascular disease (controls 34.5% vs Marfan syndrome 4.2% and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome 8.7%, p < 0.0001), and diabetes (controls 20.6% vs Marfan syndrome 6.6 and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome 4.4%, p < 0.0001). Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome had higher overall complication rate (65.5% and 52.2%) compared to controls (44.6%), p < 0.0001. Postoperative hemorrhage was more likely in Marfan syndrome (42.9%) and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (39.1%) than controls (22.2%), p < 0.0001. Increased respiratory failure was noted in Marfan syndrome (20.2%) vs controls (10.7%) and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (8.7%), p = .0003. Finally, length of stay was increased in Marfan syndrome 12.5 days vs Ehlers-Danlos syndrome 7.4 days and controls 7.2 days (p < 0.0001) as well as a higher median costs of index hospitalization in Marfan syndrome ($57,084 vs Ehlers-Danlos syndrome $22,032 and controls $26,520, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS:Patients with Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome differ from other patients undergoing vascular surgical procedures, with a significantly higher proportion of aortic procedures including open aneurysm repair and thoracic endovascular aortic repair. While they are younger with fewer comorbidities, due to the unique pathogenesis of their underlying connective tissue disorder, there is an overall higher rate of procedural complications and increased length of stay and cost for Marfan syndrome patients undergoing aortic surgery.   \n",
       "16  Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), hypermobility type, is probably the most common EDS type, as well as the most common heritable connective tissue disorder. Bladder dysfunction is a rare clinical manifestation of EDS and manifests itself as primary nocturnal enuresis. We present a 10-year-old boy referred to the paediatrics nephrology consultation due to primary nocturnal enuresis and day time symptoms of urinary urgency. During the appointment, a tendency to joint hypermobility was noted. On evaluation the skin was hyperextensible and the Beighton score was positive. The genetic testing revealed a variant of the COL5A1 gene not yet described in the literature.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "2   BACKGROUND:Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is a multifaceted disease that can present with a variety of types of pain. Unfortunately, both the mechanisms and treatments for pain are poorly understood. The proposed treatments for the various musculoskeletal pain syndromes in EDS have had variable success, and it becomes much more imperative to better define and evaluate the current treatment modalities in treating this debilitating disease. OBJECTIVES:The purpose of this study was to investigate the currently available treatment modalities for patients with EDS and their efficacies in pain and symptom relief. STUDY DESIGN:Retrospective cohort study. SETTING:Institutional physical medicine and rehabilitation primary care clinic. METHODS:All patients were seen between January 2015 and April 2019, in which 98 patients with EDS were identified through retrospective chart review. Institutional review board approval was obtained, and all patients provided written consent to be included in the study. We reviewed various treatment modalities, including complimentary/alternative treatments, opioids/opioid-like medications, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, physical therapy, occupational therapy, muscle relaxants, neuropathic modulators, steroids, surgery/procedures, and acetaminophen. Treatment methods were extracted from individual patient charts, and efficacy was grouped into 3 categories: improvement, no effect, or worsened symptoms. RESULTS:The most common treatments used were complimentary/alternative treatments (n = 88). Occupational therapy and bracing were the most effective options with 70% of patients reporting improvement. Neuropathic modulators were the least well tolerated with 47% of patients reporting adverse effects. LIMITATIONS:Men were a small percentage of the study. Patients were not randomized, and pain score reporting was subjective. Patient data were extracted from a single practice setting. Timing and symptom onset were not measured. CONCLUSIONS:There is a relative paucity of published literature regarding the various treatment methods for EDS. Although our study is able to identify positive and negative trends with certain modalities, it is vital to understand that EDS is not a uniform diagnosis among patients, and that a combination of several different treatments usually is needed for optimal symptom control. Further research and investigation are necessary to develop a comprehensive treatment database for this complex condition.

       "9   PURPOSE OF REVIEW:To summarize the bone findings, mainly bone mass and fracture risk, in Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS). RECENT FINDINGS:Low bone mineral density and fractures seem to be frequent in some of the rare EDS types (kyphoscoliotic, arthrochalasia, spondylodysplastic, and classic-like EDS). For the more prevalent hypermobile and classic EDS types, some case-control studies found mildly decreased bone mineral density, but it was not clear that fracture rates were increased. Nevertheless, abnormalities in vertebral shape seem to be common in classical and hypermobile EDS types. In a cohort of individuals with EDS followed since birth, no fractures were observed during infancy. Bone mineral density varies widely among the different types of EDS, and vertebral abnormalities seem to be common in classical and hypermobile EDS. It might be justified to perform spine radiographs and bone mineral density assessments in newly diagnosed EDS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "14  Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is a connective tissue disorder characterized by joint hypermobility and skin extensibility and is often accompanied by chronic pain. Rhythmic sensory stimulation (RSS) can be defined as the stimulation of the senses in a periodic manner within a range of low frequencies. Music plus sound delivered through a vibroacoustic device is a form of RSS and has demonstrated utility in managing pain. In this current study, we conducted an open-label pilot study of 15 patients with hypermobile EDS using RSS as the intervention. Posttreatment improvements were seen in 11 of the 15 patients (73%), whereas 3 of the 15 patients (20%) experienced worse outcomes. Of the 14 patients that completed the experiment, 6 participants (43%) were classified as \"responders\" to the device while 8 participants (57%) were classified as \"nonresponders.\" Responders demonstrated significant improvements in pain interference (51.5 ± 16 preintervention vs. 43.5 ± 16.4 postintervention BPI score) and depression symptoms (34.0 ± 15.9 preintervention vs. 26.8 ± 12.1 postintervention CESD score). Poststudy interviews confirm the improvements of pain interference, mood, and bowel symptoms. Furthermore, analysis of medical conditions within the responder group indicates that the presence of depression, anxiety, irritable bowel syndrome, and fibromyalgia may indicate a greater likelihood for patients to benefit with vibroacoustic applications. These results indicate a possible potential for RSS, delivered using a vibroacoustic device, in managing pain-related symptoms. Further research is necessary to elucidate the exact mechanism behind the physiological benefits of RSS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "18  BACKGROUND:Patients with vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) occasionally suffer from arterial dissection. Eagle syndrome, which is caused by an elongated styloid process and also causes arterial dissection, is difficult to diagnose and could sometimes be overlooked. Little is known of the coexistence of these two diseases, and treatment strategy is not established. Here, we present a case of bilateral internal carotid artery (ICA) dissection due to Eagle syndrome in a patient with vascular EDS. CASE PRESENTATION:A 30-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of sudden onset of mild sensory disturbance in his left limbs. He had a history of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) and also had left cervical internal carotid artery (ICA) dissection 3 years before. Diffusion-weighted imaging showed acute cerebral infarcts in the right hemisphere. Cervical computed tomography angiography (CTA) revealed the right ICA narrowing at the cervical portion in addition to the previous left cervical ICA dissection. Cervical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed double-lumen and intramural hematoma at the narrowing portion of the right cervical ICA, which indicates arterial dissection. CT also revealed bilateral elongated styloid processes which are close to each side of cervical ICA. We diagnosed him as bilateral ICA dissection due to bilateral Eagle syndrome. Considering vascular complications due to vascular EDS, we performed closer follow-up with transoral carotid ultrasonography (TOCU). In 4 months, his right ICA dissection gradually improved without stroke recurrence or deterioration of dissection. CONCLUSIONS:Since patients with vascular EDS easily develop arterial dissection, Eagle syndrome may be overlooked. Clinicians should consider Eagle syndrome in the case of vascular EDS with extracranial ICA dissection and close follow-up should be prioritized in cases of Eagle syndrome with vascular EDS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "15  BACKGROUND:Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) is a rare disease affecting approximately 1 in 5,000 people. Although ophthalmic conditions associated with EDS have been described, little data exist concerning ophthalmic surgical outcomes experienced by EDS patients. METHODS:Patients with EDS were surveyed via the EDS Society and asked about their ophthalmic surgical experiences including procedure, complications, and the timing with respect to receiving the EDS diagnosis. Complications were confirmed as such by subspecialists. RESULTS:Of 579 respondents, 467 reported confirmed EDS, and 112 of those had an ophthalmic procedure, including refractive surgery, cataract/lens surgery, retinal surgery, strabismus surgery, oculoplastic surgery, corneal surgery, and laser surgery for glaucoma. The rate of confirmed complications was: 23%-refractive, 33%-lens/cataract, 33%-retina, 59%-strabismus, 23%- oculoplastics, 0%-cornea, and 25%-glaucoma laser. In addition, 76% of patients underwent surgery prior to the EDS diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS:Patients with EDS may have elevated risk of postoperative ophthalmic surgical complications. It would seem reasonable to systemically and prospectively explore how patients with EDS respond to ophthalmic surgery. Furthermore, it would seem circumspect to ask surgical candidates patients about whether they carry a diagnosis of EDS or have signs and symptoms of EDS prior to surgery.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "4   BACKGROUND:Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is a heterogeneous disease affecting connective tissues. EDS patients have a high susceptibility for developing anastomotic leak after visceral surgery. Although patients with EDS can also develop severe obesity and might be referred to bariatric surgery, there is just 1 case report in the literature regarding the outcomes of bariatric surgery in this specific context. OBJECTIVE:To report the cases of patients with EDS and severe obesity that underwent bariatric surgery. SETTING:Five French hospitals (University Hospital of Nantes, APHP Pitié Salpêtrière Hospital, APHP Bichat Hospital, Clinique St Gregoire Rennes, and Clinique Mutualiste de l'Estuaire St Nazaire). METHODS:We report the cases of 7 patients with EDS and severe obesity who underwent surgery. RESULTS:All patients showed classical postoperative course except for 1 case of excessive bleeding. There was no increased pain, leak, and solid parietal healing was achieved in all patients at 1 month postoperatively. The percent excess weight loss at 1 and 6 months were 13.9 ± 3.8% and 45.3 ± 16%, respectively. CONCLUSION:Our study shows that bariatric surgery is a relevant and apparently safe surgical option to consider in severely obese patients with EDS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "7   BACKGROUND:Musculocontractural Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a new and rare subtype of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome in which anesthetic considerations for airway and respiratory management, prevention of skin injuries and joint dislocations, and hemostatic management for severe perioperative bleeding are required. CASE PRESENTATION:A 19-year-old woman with musculocontractural Ehlers-Danlos syndrome was scheduled to undergo posterior spinal fusion from the 4th thoracic to the 4th lumbar vertebrae under general anesthesia. Her trachea was easily intubated with a videolaryngoscope despite a small mouth and micrognathia. Pressure-controlled ventilation with limited peak inspiratory pressure was performed for prevention of pneumothorax. Skin damage and joint luxation were prevented by using a low rebounding mattress, terpolymer-based barrier film, and careful patient positioning. Blood transfusion was effectively performed on the basis of point-of-care viscoelastic hemostatic assay monitoring. She had an uneventful postoperative course without any complications. CONCLUSIONS:We safely managed a patient with musculocontractural Ehlers-Danlos syndrome undergoing scoliosis surgery.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "3   BACKGROUND:Surgical management of shoulder instability in patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) remains challenging secondary to the pathologic nature of their connective tissue. Allograft reconstruction of the shoulder capsule in EDS has the potential to increase stability by providing healthier connective tissue. The purpose of this study was to report the surgical technique and outcome of open capsulorraphy and augmentation of the anterior capsule with Achilles tendon allograft in patients with shoulder instability in the setting of EDS. METHODS:Five shoulders (4 patients) with EDS and severe anteroinferior or multidirectional instability underwent open capsular shift combined with Achilles allograft augmentation of the anterior capsule. Patients were evaluated for pain, motion, recurrent instability, subjective shoulder value (SSV), ASES score, complications and reoperations. The mean follow-up time was 3.6 years (range, 2 to 5 years). RESULTS:Shoulder stability was restored in 4 of 5 (80%) shoulders. At final follow-up, the mean SSV and ASES scores were 84 and 77.3, respectively. One shoulder developed recurrent posterior instability after an injury 1.6 years after the index procedure. The mean pain VAS was 7 preoperatively and 2 at most recent follow-up. Before surgery, all patients reported use of narcotic pain medication, whereas at most recent follow-up only the one patient who had experienced recurrence reported moderate pain. Except for the shoulder that required revision surgery for posterior shoulder instability, there were no complications or other reoperations. CONCLUSION:Open capsulorraphy with Achilles Allograft augmentation improved stability and pain 4 of 5 shoulders with instability in the setting of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. In this small case series of EDS patients, Achilles tendon allograft augmentation was safe and effective as a primary or revision surgical procedure for anterior shoulder instability. A larger patient cohort with longer follow-up is needed to confirm these findings.

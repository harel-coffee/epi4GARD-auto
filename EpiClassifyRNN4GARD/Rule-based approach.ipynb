      "Two brothers had retinal degeneration, lens subluxation, and myopia since early life. There was no evidence of Marfan syndrome, homocystinuria, or other systemic disease. They had nystagmus, myopia, inferior dislocation of the lens, and posterior subcapsular opacities in both eyes. Fundus examination showed attenuated retinal vessels, macular atrophy with occasional pigment accumulation as clumps, and perivascular sleeves. Electroretinography revealed decreased photopic and scotopic responses. The visual fields were constricted. We believe this to be the first report of retinal degeneration with bilateral lens subluxation in a family. It appears to be inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion.\n",
      "The molecular basis of X-linked recessive anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia with immunodeficiency (EDA-ID) has remained elusive. Here we report hypomorphic mutations in the gene IKBKG in 12 males with EDA-ID from 8 kindreds, and 2 patients with a related and hitherto unrecognized syndrome of EDA-ID with osteopetrosis and lymphoedema (OL-EDA-ID). Mutations in the coding region of IKBKG are associated with EDA-ID, and stop codon mutations, with OL-EDA-ID. IKBKG encodes NEMO, the regulatory subunit of the IKK (IkappaB kinase) complex, which is essential for NF-kappaB signaling. Germline loss-of-function mutations in IKBKG are lethal in male fetuses. We show that IKBKG mutations causing OL-EDA-ID and EDA-ID impair but do not abolish NF-kappaB signaling. We also show that the ectodysplasin receptor, DL, triggers NF-kappaB through the NEMO protein, indicating that EDA results from impaired NF-kappaB signaling. Finally, we show that abnormal immunity in OL-EDA-ID patients results from impaired cell responses to lipopolysaccharide, interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-18, TNFalpha and CD154. We thus report for the first time that impaired but not abolished NF-kappaB signaling in humans results in two related syndromes that associate specific developmental and immunological defects.\n",
      "Identification of a novel compound heterozygous of GNB5 in a patient with intellectual developmental disorder with cardiac arrhytmia (IDDCA), from non-consaguineous family. Three-dimensional modelling and in silico predictions suggest that GNB5 variants are causative of the phenotype, extending the number of IDDCA patients so far identified.\n",
      "A combination of the Robin sequence with pre- and postaxial oligodactyly was observed in a mother and her son. This familial association has not been reported before and probably represents a previously unrecognized heritable malformation syndrome.\n",
      "Children presenting with disseminated viral infections should be carefully investigated because they almost invariably have an underlying immunodeficiency.

      "We report a 16-year-old girl with neonatal progeroid features and congenital lipodystrophy who was considered at birth as a possible variant of Wiedemann-Rautenstrauch syndrome. The emergence of additional clinical signs (marfanoid habitus, severe myopia and dilatation of the aortic bulb) lead to consider the diagnosis of the progeroid variant of Marfan syndrome. A de novo donor splice-site mutation (c.8226+1G>A) was identified in FBN1. We show that this mutation leads to exon 64 skipping and to the production of a stable mRNA that should allow synthesis of a truncated profibrillin-1, in which the C-terminal furin cleavage site is altered. FBN1 mutations associated with a similar phenotype have only been reported in four other patients. We confirm the correlation between marfanoid phenotype with congenital lipodystrophy and neonatal progeroid features (marfanoid-progeroid-lipodystrophy syndrome) and frameshift mutations at the 3' end of FBN1. This syndrome should be considered in differential diagnosis of neonatal progeroid syndromes.\n",
      "Milroy's primary congenital lymphedema (PCL) (hereditary lymphedema type I, Milroy disease) is present at birth, and mostly affects the dorsal aspects of feet. It is mostly a life-long condition but does not affect longevity. Complications are rare except for chronic discomfort and warmness of affected areas. PCL is an autosomal dominant disease with incomplete penetrance due to a mutation in the gene locus encoding for VEGFR3 with resultant dysgenesis of microlymphatic vessels. We report on two fetuses where ultrasonographic examination at 15 weeks of gestation showed significant edema of the dorsal aspects of both feet with no evidence of other major malformations. Whereas in one fetus the edema resolved completely, it persisted in the second fetus and proved after birth to be of lymphedematous nature. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of early prenatal diagnosis of primary congenital lymphedema via fetal ultrasonographic examination and of spontaneous resolution of lymphedema during fetal life.\n",
      "We report the first family with adult onset cervical dystonia in which monozygotic twins and multiple family members are affected. In this family, the disease exhibits an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, and all affected members have only cervical dystonia. Five members have definite cervical dystonia, and five others have possible cervical dystonia. Although identical genotypically, the twins demonstrate some phenotypic variation. Despite long follow-up, no family members have shown progression from focal to generalized dystonia. This family may prove valuable in identifying a gene locus for cervical dystonia and hence determine whether a single gene locus exists for hereditable focal dystonia and generalized dystonia.\n",
      "Enlarged parietal foramina (>5 mm) is an extremely rare developmental defect of the parietal bone, which is distinguished from the normal small parietal foramina, as genes associated with this entity have been identified, suggesting that it is hereditary in nature. We describe a dry skull of a 35-year-old female, with enlarged parietal foramina symmetrically situated bilaterally, oval in shape, measuring 4.5 √ó 9.3 mm (right) and 4.9 √ó 9.2 mm (left) in size. The foramina coexisted with multiple Wormian bones in several sites of the skull. On the inner parietal bone surface, the anterior, posterior and lateral foramina's rims carried grooves, which were continuous with the middle meningeal vessels' branches, indicating that a rich vascular network existed around the foramina. These vascular grooves also notched the external table at the margin of the foramina, which suggests a potential communication between the meningeal and the scalp vessels. In addition, this vascular variation should be taken into consideration when performing surgical interventions in the area, because the large vascular supply to the foramina is a possible source of extensive bleeding. Moreover, the interaction of intracranial and extracranial veins and the fact that the blood flows in them in both directions, as they are valveless, could represent a possible pathway for infections to spread in the cranial cavity.\n",
      "We describe 3 unrelated newborn males with a previously unreported constellation of congenital anomalies. All 3 died neonatally of hepatic failure. Clinically, they presented with a pattern of malformations characterized by prenatal linear growth deficiency, hypertrophied alveolar ridges, redundant nuchal skin, and postaxial polydactyly. All 3 cases had male external genitalia with cryptorchidism, and 2 of them, a small penis. Necropsies showed similar internal anomalies, consisting of m√ºllerian duct remnants, lymphangiectasis, and renal anomalies. The karyotypes were normal (46, XY) in skin fibroblasts (Case 1) and in peripheral blood lymphocytes (Case 3). Although this pattern of congenital anomalies must be differentiated from several other lethal syndromes, to our knowledge, no similar cases have been described previously. Cause of this syndrome is unknown. Because Case 2 had a previous brother with similar anomalies, we suspect that this new entity probably is an autosomal recessive or X-linked trait.\n",
      "An unusually high frequency of atypical Parkinson syndrome has been delineated over the last 5 years in the French West Indies. Postural instability with early falls, prominent frontal lobe dysfunction and pseudo-bulbar palsy were common and three-quarters of the patients were L-dopa unresponsive. One-third of all patients seen had probable progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). This new focus of atypical parkinsonism is reminiscent of the one described in Guam and may be linked to exposure to tropical plants containing mitochondrial complex I inhibitors (quinolines, acetogenins, rotenoids). Two hundred and twenty consecutive patients with Parkinson's syndrome seen by the neurology service at Pointe √† Pitre, Guadeloupe University Hospital were studied. Currently accepted operational clinical criteria for Parkinson's syndromes were applied. The pathological findings of three patients who came to autopsy are reported. Fifty-eight patients had probable PSP, 96 had undetermined parkinsonism and 50 had Parkinson's disease, 15 had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with parkinsonism and one had probable multiple system atrophy. All three PSP patients in whom post-mortem study was performed had early postural instability, gaze palsy and parkinsonian symptoms, followed by a frontolimbic dementia and corticobulbar signs. Neuropathological examination showed an accumulation of tau proteins, predominating in the midbrain. There was an exceptionally large accumulation of neuropil threads in Case 1. Biochemical studies detected a major doublet of pathological tau at 64 and 69 kDa in brain tissue homogenates. All cases were homozygous for the H1 tau haplotype, but no mutation of the tau gene was observed. Clinical, neuropathological and biochemical features were compatible with the diagnosis of PSP, although some unusual pathological features were noted in Case 1. A cluster of cases presenting with atypical parkinsonism is reported. Guadeloupean parkinsonism may prove to be a tauopathy identical or closely related to PSP.\n",
      "Two previous case reports described two sibs affected with both sensorineural hearing loss and oligodontia. Here, we report a similar syndrome in a male patient with an, as yet, undescribed vestibular aqueduct enlargement on tomodensitometry. The analysis of the parent's audiograms is consistent with the suggested autosomal recessive mode of inheritance of this disorder.\n",
      "We describe two sisters with distal, slowly progressive muscular weakness and hypotrophy since childhood, autonomic dysfunction characterized by profuse sweating, distal cyanosis related to cold weather, orthostatic hypotension, and esophageal achalasia. Nerve conduction velocity of several motor nerves was slow, and although no sensory abnormalities were present, sural nerve biopsy revealed severe nonspecific demyelination. No similar patients could be found in the literature and we therefore suggest the possibility that these individuals have a newly recognized hereditary syndrome.\n",
      "The hetero-octameric conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex is essential for the structure/function of the Golgi apparatus through regulation of membrane trafficking. Here, we describe a patient with a mild form of a congenital disorder of glycosylation type II (CDG-II), which is caused by a homozygous nonsense mutation in the hCOG8 gene. This leads to a premature stop codon resulting in a truncated Cog8 subunit lacking the 76 C-terminal amino acids. Mass spectrometric analysis of the N- and O-glycan structures identified a mild sialylation deficiency. We showed that the molecular basis of this defect in N- and O-glycosylation is caused by the disruption of the Cog1-Cog8 interaction due to truncation. As a result, Cog1 deficiency accompanies the Cog8 deficiency, preventing assembly of the intact, stable complex and resulting in the appearance of smaller subcomplexes. Moreover, levels of beta1,4-galactosytransferase were significantly reduced. The defects in O-glycosylation could be fully restored by transfecting the patient's fibroblasts with full-length Cog8. The Cog8 defect described here represents a novel type of CDG-II, which we propose to name as CDG-IIh or CDG caused by Cog8 deficiency (CDG-II/Cog8).\n",
      "In a highly consanguineous, predominantly Cree Indian community in northern Saskatchewan, Canada, 14 similarly malformed babies have been born to eight different mothers since 1953. Six of these infants are reported to assist delineation of the syndrome. The major manifestations of the condition are: Intrauterine growth retardation, perinatal death, marked microcephaly, and severe malformations of the limbs, especially the arms. Elbows are fused, forearms are greatly shortened and usually contain only a single bone, and the hands are very abnormal with only two to four malformed digits. Parental consanguinity, a sex ratio close to one, and a 25% segregation ratio all support autosomal recessive inheritance of this syndrome.\n",
      "We report on the case of a 17-year-old boy with clinical features compatible with Lowry-Wood syndrome: microcephaly, short stature, multiple epiphyseal dysplasia, tapetoretinal degeneration, and mental retardation. Bilateral restricted elbow extension, knock knees and hip dislocation were also present. Radiographs showed evidence of radial dislocation due to the absence of the radial heads, lateral dislocation of both patellae, multiple epiphyseal dysplasia that was more severe at the proximal femoral epiphyses, and dislocation of both hips with severe hip dysplasia. The patient developed a behavioral disorder at age 15. Conventional karyotyping was normal (46,XY). Molecular karyotyping, performed through array-based competitive genomic hybridization, showed copy number variants that were probably benign. We suggest that multiple joint dislocations, including the patellae, may be a sign of Lowry-Wood syndrome.\n",
      "Three unrelated Japanese patients who presented with ataxia and mild mental retardation were examined in this study. Early development was normal in two patients and slightly delayed in one. All could walk independently, but were unstable due to cerebellar ataxia. They had mild intellectual retardation and displayed slow, progressive, and mild clinical courses. Two patients lost the ability to walk at 12 and 25 years of age. Brain MRI of the three patients revealed diffuse cerebral hypomyelination, moderate cerebellar cortical atrophy, and hypoplasia of the corpus callosum, which were seen in other diffuse hypomyelination syndrome. No known abnormalities were found in biochemical and genetic studies. Auditory brainstem responses and nerve conduction studies were normal. A definite diagnosis could not be made because of the lack of hypodontia, hypogonadism, cataracts, or basal ganglia atrophy. Based on common MRI findings and the relatively mild clinical courses, we believe that these patients may have another subset form of diffuse hypomyelination syndrome involving the cerebral white matter and cerebellum.\n",
      "Prune-belly syndrome (PBS) is a rare congenital syndrome characterized by deficient abdominal muscles, urinary tract malformation, and in males, cryptorchidism and has an estimated incidence of 1 in 35,000 to 1 in 50,000 live births. The syndrome might be due to severe bladder outlet obstruction or to abdominal muscle deficiency secondary to a migrational defect of the lateral mesoblast between weeks 6 and 7 of pregnancy. The current review of the medical record reports a special focus on epidemiology, genetic factors, early prenatal diagnosis clusters, treatment, and prognosis of PBS.\n",
      "Trisomy of the long arm of chromosome 1 is a very rare cytogenetic anomaly that is difficult to diagnose because of tissue-limited mosaicism. This study aimed to further characterize the prenatal and post-natal findings associated with this anomaly, including the first reported chromosomal microarray finding.This is a retrospective study of six cases of mos 46,X,der(Y)t(Y;1)(q12;q21)/46,XY, diagnosed both prenatally and post-natally. Detailed clinical features and pregnancy outcome were documented.Recurrent prenatal and post-natal features of our case series, as well as the previously reported cases, were described, suggesting a Fryns-like phenotype. A diagnosis of mosaic trisomy 1q is difficult to confirm post-natally in some cases because of the tissue provided for analysis, emphasizing the need to study multiple tissue types in cases of fetal loss with a suspected underlying chromosomal imbalance.The overlap of clinical features between mosaic trisomy 1q and Fryns syndrome emphasizes the need to obtain appropriate samples for genetic analysis. The present cases and a review of the literature suggest that partial trisomy of the long arm of chromosome 1 is a distinct de novo clinical entity with low recurrence risk. √Ç¬© 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\n",
      "Three patients are described with antibody deficiency, recurrent infections, and alopecia. One patient had congenital agammaglobulinemia; the other two patients, a brother and sister, had an incomplete antibody deficiency syndrome. The loss of hair in each patient was total; the history was typical of alopecia areata. The association of alopecia and antibody deficiency has not previously been described to our knowledge in children.\n",
      "BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Copenhagen syndrome, or progressive noninfectious anterior vertebral fusion, is a rare disorder of unknown etiology that usually presents with thoracolumbar kyphosis in childhood. There have been no long-term reports on outcome in children with multiple affected levels with longitudinal imaging from infancy to adulthood. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to report the long-term outcome of nonoperative management of a child with Copenhagen syndrome affecting 19 vertebral levels. STUDY DESIGN: This study is a case report. METHODS: The study included longitudinal clinical and radiological follow-ups. RESULTS: A 1-year-old female presented with thoracolumbar kyphosis. Plain radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated kyphosis associated with anterior disc space narrowing plus T11-T12 and L2-L3 vertebral end-plate abnormalities. Initial treatment with a plaster jacket followed by brace failed to prevent progressive vertebral involvement and kyphosis during childhood. At skeletal maturity, no further levels became involved, and progression was halted. In total, 19 levels showed anterior fusion. CONCLUSIONS: This case describes the long-term outcome of nonoperative management for progressive noninfectious anterior vertebral fusion affecting multiple levels. Extensive vertebral involvement does not always require surgical intervention. There is a need for future research on the prognostic indicators for progression and long-term outcome.\n",
      "Ameloblastic carcinoma (AC) is a rare malignant lesion with characteristic histologic features and clinical behavior that dictates a more aggressive surgical approach than that of a simple ameloblastoma. The tumor cells resemble the cells seen in ameloblastoma, but they show cytologic atypia. Direct extension of the tumor, lymph node involvement, and metastasis to various sites (frequently the lung) have been reported. Wide local excision is the treatment of choice. Regional lymph node dissection should be considered and performed selectively. Literature shows that radiotherapy and chemotherapy is of limited value for the treatment of AC. A case of AC of maxillary region is presented here. Clinical/histological characteristics of this tumor and current knowledge on the classification of odontogenic malignancies are also discussed.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Mutations in the four-and-a-half LIM domain 1 gene (FHL1) cause X-linked late-onset scapuloaxioperoneal myopathy characterized by postural muscle atrophy with rigid spine syndrome with pseudoathleticism/hypertrophy (XMPMA), reducing body myopathy (RBM), and scapuloperoneal myopathy. Divergences in these diseases are hitherto unclear; therefore, we searched for additional families to elucidate differences and similarities of these allelic FHL1opathies. METHODS: Using genotyping and phenotyping (mutational analysis, muscle histopathology, and Western blotting) we characterized 10 affected men and 8 women from 7 families. RESULTS: All patients displayed the XMPMA phenotype. In 1 family with a novel missense mutation, 2 affected men had an aneurysm of the sinus of Valsalva in addition. In 5 affected men and 2 affected women from 4 families, the C224W missense mutation in FHL1 was detected, which putatively disrupts the fourth LIM domain. In 3 other families with 5 affected men and 1 female, 2 novel missense variants and a novel splice-site mutation in the C terminus of FHL1 were found. Muscle morphology revealed mild to moderate degenerative myopathy with myofiber hypertrophy of both fiber types at younger age and cytoplasmic bodies in the majority of the samples. Reducing bodies, pathognomonic for RBM, were not found. Western blotting revealed no detectable FHL1A protein in our patients. CONCLUSIONS: As a consequence of C terminal FHL1 gene mutations, the X-linked myopathy characterized by postural muscle atrophy (XMPMA) phenotype and morphotype with cytoplasmic bodies are found. In the spectrum of FHL1opathies, the preserved FHL1C protein is likely responsible for the moderate XMPMA phenotype compared with the more severe reducing body myopathy/scapuloperoneal myopathy phenotype.\n",
      "We describe a family with an unusual autosomal dominant anterior corneal dystrophy. The onset was characterized by frequent, recurrent corneal erosions in the first decade. This subsided during adolescence and was followed by progressive decreased vision. Slit-lamp examination revealed bilateral subepithelial opacities and haze, involving the entire cornea, but most dense centrally. Histopathological study revealed a subepithelial band of eosinophilic, periodic acid-Schiff-positive, alcian blue-positive, hyaluronidase-sensitive material anterior to Bowman's layer. Electron microscopy demonstrated subepithelial deposition of fine fibrillar material consistent with glycosaminoglycan. Immunohistochemical analysis indicated that the accumulated material contained a combination of chondroitin 4-sulfate and dermatan sulfate. This unique condition clinically resembled Grayson-Wilbrandt dystrophy, but differed histochemically. To our knowledge, this anterior corneal dystrophy has not previously been reported, and it is best described by the name \"subepithelial mucinous corneal dystrophy.\"\n",
      "A 16-month-old girl with cutaneomeningospinal angiomatosis became paraplegic because of the intraspinal arteriovenous malformation. Since skin hemangiomas occurred in three successive generations of the girl's family, this may represent the first inherited case of this condition. In children with signs of a spinal space-occupying lesion, the presence of a skin hemangioma, especially if it is in a corresponding dermatome, could be the clue to early diagnosis of a spinal angioma.\n",
      "Congenital diarrheal disorders (CDDs) are a collection of rare, heterogeneous enteropathies with early onset and often severe outcomes. Here, we report a family of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, with 2 out of 3 children affected by CDD. Both affected children presented 3 days after birth with severe, intractable diarrhea. One child died from complications at age 17 months. The second child showed marked improvement, with resolution of most symptoms at 10 to 12 months of age. Using exome sequencing, we identified a rare splice site mutation in the DGAT1 gene and found that both affected children were homozygous carriers. Molecular analysis of the mutant allele indicated a total loss of function, with no detectable DGAT1 protein or activity produced. The precise cause of diarrhea is unknown, but we speculate that it relates to abnormal fat absorption and buildup of DGAT substrates in the intestinal mucosa. Our results identify DGAT1 loss-of-function mutations as a rare cause of CDDs. These findings prompt concern for DGAT1 inhibition in humans, which is being assessed for treating metabolic and other diseases.\n",
      "Segmental duplications, which comprise approximately 5%-10% of the human genome, are known to mediate medically relevant deletions, duplications, and inversions through nonallelic homologous recombination (NAHR) and have been suggested to be hot spots in chromosome evolution and human genomic instability. We report seven individuals with microdeletions at 17q23.1q23.2, identified by microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH). Six of the seven deletions are approximately 2.2 Mb in size and flanked by large segmental duplications of >98% sequence identity and in the same orientation. One of the deletions is approximately 2.8 Mb in size and is flanked on the distal side by a segmental duplication, whereas the proximal breakpoint falls between segmental duplications. These characteristics suggest that NAHR mediated six out of seven of these rearrangements. These individuals have common features, including mild to moderate developmental delay (particularly speech delay), microcephaly, postnatal growth retardation, heart defects, and hand, foot, and limb abnormalities. Although all individuals had at least mild dysmorphic facial features, there was no characteristic constellation of features that would elicit clinical suspicion of a specific disorder. The identification of common clinical features suggests that microdeletions at 17q23.1q23.2 constitute a novel syndrome. Furthermore, the inclusion in the minimal deletion region of TBX2 and TBX4, transcription factors belonging to a family of genes implicated in a variety of developmental pathways including those of heart and limb, suggests that these genes may play an important role in the phenotype of this emerging syndrome.\n",
      "An Arab family is reported in which the proband and two affected sibs had bilateral rhizomelia of the humerus and other skeletal, craniofacial and cardiac abnormalities. Since all three affected sibs died during early childhood, this may be a lethal condition. We believe this constellation of findings which has not been previously described represents a new syndrome, most probably transmitted as an autosomal recessive disorder.\n",
      "A distinctive phenotype of severe microcephaly and self-limiting dilated cardiomyopathy has been observed in two sibs suggesting autosomal recessive inheritance. Mental retardation, delayed developmental milestones, and minor dysmorphism were additional features.\n",
      "In a male patient with developmental delay, autistic behaviour, obesity, lymphedema, hypertension, macrocephaly, and facial features of chromosome 5p duplication (trisomy 5p) a 3.7 Mb de novo tandem microduplication of 5p13.1-13.2 (rs4703415-rs261752, i.e., chr5:35.62-39.36 Mb) was identified. This observation contributes to the characterization and dissection of the 5p13 duplication syndrome. The possible role of increased NIPBL gene dosage is discussed.\n",
      "We report a case study spanning three generations of familial spastic paraplegia, distal amyotrophy and poikiloderma. This study is the first description of an association between these three disorders. The gait disorder, the sensory and motor involvement and the skin disorder coincide in all the affected members, suggesting autosomal dominant inheritance with complete penetrance.\n",
      "Biallelic defects in the RIN2 gene, encoding the Ras and Rab interactor 2 protein, are associated with a rare autosomal recessive connective tissue disorder, with only nine patients from four independent families reported to date. The condition was initially termed MACS syndrome (macrocephaly, alopecia, cutis laxa, and scoliosis), based on the clinical features of the first identified family; however, with the expansion of the clinical phenotype in additional families, it was subsequently coined RIN2 syndrome. Hallmark features of this condition include dysmorphic facial features with striking, progressive facial coarsening, sparse hair, normal to enlarged occipitofrontal circumference, soft redundant and/or hyperextensible skin, and scoliosis. Patients with RIN2 syndrome present phenotypic overlap with other conditions, including EDS (especially the dermatosparaxis and kyphoscoliosis subtypes). Here, we describe a 10th patient, the first patient of Caucasian origin and the oldest reported patient so far, who harbors the previously identified homozygous RIN2 mutation c.1878dupC (p. (Ile627Hisfs*7)). Besides the hallmark features, this patient also presents problems not previously associated with RIN2 syndrome, including cervical vertebral fusion, mild hearing loss, and colonic fibrosis. We provide an overview of the clinical findings in all reported patients with RIN2 mutations and summarize some of the possible pathogenic mechanisms that may underlie this condition. √Ç¬© 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\n",
      "Tetrasomy 9p is a rare condition initially reported by Ghymers et al. Reported cases are a mix of prenatal and neonatal/pediatric cases in non-mosaic and mosaic cases. We report on the common mechanism leading to this form of chromosome abnormality, the various types of tetrasomy 9p as well as the prenatal sonographic and laboratory presentation of our case and previously reported cases with mosaic and non-mosaic tetrasomy 9p. From these reported cases, a recognizable syndrome is emerging. Multiple fetal abnormalities amenable to ultrasound diagnosis are likely to be present. However, neither ultrasound study alone nor the first-trimester screen for the common aneuploidies can suggest the correct diagnosis. Chromosome study of more than a single tissue is necessary in order to establish the correct diagnosis and to differentiate between mosaic and non-mosaic tetrasomy 9p cases.\n",
      "Dihydropyrimidinase (DHP) deficiency is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the DPYS gene. Patients present with highly elevated levels of dihydrouracil and dihydrothymine in their urine, blood and cerebrospinal fluid. The analysis of the effect of mutations in DPYS on pre-mRNA splicing is hampered by the fact that DHP is primarily expressed in liver and kidney cells. The minigene approach can detect mRNA splicing aberrations using cells that do not express the endogenous mRNA. We have used a minigene-based approach to analyze the effects of a presumptive pre-mRNA splicing mutation in two newly identified Chinese pediatric patients with DHP deficiency. Mutation analysis of DPYS showed that both patients were compound heterozygous for a novel intronic mutation c.1443+5G>A in intron 8 and a previously described missense mutation c.1001A>G (p.Q334R) in exon 6. Wild-type and the mutated minigene constructs, containing exons 7, 8 and 9 of DPYS, yielded different splicing products after expression in HEK293 cells. The c.1443+5G>A mutation resulted in altered pre-mRNA splicing of the DPYS minigene construct with full skipping of exon 8. Analysis of the DHP crystal structure showed that the deletion of exon 8 severely affects folding, stability and homooligomerization of the enzyme as well as disruption of the catalytic site. Thus, the analysis suggests that the c.1443+5G>A mutation results in aberrant splicing of the pre-mRNA encoding DHP, underlying the DHP deficiency in two unrelated Chinese patients.\n",
      "Neonatal screening for phenylketonuria (PKU) was introduced as a pilot project in Thailand from 1992--1995, and mass screening was started in 1996 by the Department of Medical Sciences, Ministry of Public Health. Blood samples were collected by heelprick on filter paper either at 48 hours of life or before discharge from the hospital. Elevated blood phenylalanine was identified by screening with the Guthrie method, then followed by the fluorometric method: All infants with a phenylalanine level equal to or greater than 4 mg/dl were recalled and retested using the fluorometric method and confirmed by plasma amino acid analysis and urinary pterins for tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency. A total of 1,062,676 newborns were screened from October 1992--March 2001, with 5 cases confirmed with PKU. The incidence was 1 in 212,535. All patients have been treated with low phenylalanine diet. The results of this study confirm the benefit of early detection and treatment of PKU through the screening program.\n",
      "CDAGS syndrome is an autosomal recessive syndrome characterized by craniosynostosis, large open fontanelles, hearing loss, anal anomalies, genitourinary malformations and porokeratosis. To our knowledge, only four families from different geographic regions and ethnic backgrounds have been reported until now and no molecular defect has been identified. Here we report two sisters presenting with craniosynostosis, microcephaly, short downslanting palpebral fissures, sparse hair, eyelashes, and eyebrows and porokeratosis that appeared at the age of one month. The youngest sister had an imperforate anus with rectoperineal fistula. Array-CGH did not reveal any pathological CNV. Molecular analysis of the c16orf57, RECQL4 and MCM5 genes was normal.\n",
      "Pancreatic agenesis is an extremely rare cause of neonatal diabetes mellitus and has enabled the discovery of several key transcription factors essential for normal pancreas and beta cell development.We report a case of a Caucasian female with complete pancreatic agenesis occurring together with semilobar holoprosencephaly (HPE), a more common brain developmental disorder. Clinical findings were later confirmed by autopsy, which also identified agenesis of the gallbladder. Although the sequences of a selected set of genes related to pancreas agenesis or HPE were wild-type, the patient's phenotype suggests a genetic defect that emerges early in embryonic development of brain, gallbladder and pancreas.Developmental defects of the pancreas and brain can occur together. Identifying the genetic defect may identify a novel key regulator in beta cell development.\n",
      "Inflammation is an important contributor to pediatric and adult neurodegeneration. Understanding the genetic determinants of neuroinflammation provides valuable insight into disease mechanism. We characterize a disorder of recurrent immune-mediated neurodegeneration. We report two sisters who presented with neurodegeneration triggered by infections. The proband, a previously healthy girl, presented at 22.5 months with ataxia and dysarthria following mild gastroenteritis. MRI at onset showed a symmetric signal abnormality of the cerebellar and peritrigonal white matter. Following a progressive course of partial remissions and relapses, she died at 5 years of age. Her older sister had a similar course following varicella infection, she died within 13 months. Both sisters had unremarkable routine laboratory testing, with exception of a transient mild cytopenia in the proband 19 months after presentation. Exome sequencing identified a biallelic perforin1 mutation (PRF1; p.R225W) previously associated with familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (FHL). In contrast to FHL, these girls did not have hematopathology or cytokine overproduction. However, 3 years after disease onset, the proband had markedly deficient interleukin-1 beta (IL-1√é¬≤) production. These observations extend the spectrum of disease associated with perforin mutations to immune-mediated neurodegeneration triggered by infection and possibly due to primary immunodeficiency.\n",
      "Onychomatricoma (OM) is a fibroepithelial tumor of nail matrix that occurs in the digits of both the hands and feet. This was first reported by Baran and Kint. They initially described 3 cases, all of which demonstrated a filamentous tumor of matrix tissue that resulted in a thickened funnel-shaped nail. Although apparently benign, it is subject to recurrence, and long-term follow-up is recommended because it is not known whether there is a conversion to malignancy. Even though this neoplasm was first described more than 18 years ago, there remains a dearth of case reports (currently fewer than 50) in the literature. This is a single case report and literature review.                                  Levels of Evidence               : Therapeutic, Level IV.\n",
      "Even as a rare multiple congenital anomalies/mental retardation syndrome, the C-syndrome (CS, or Opitz C-trigonoecephaly syndrome) is, at long last, beginning to attract attention because of its developmental and causal complexity. Also, the possibility that the apparently balanced translocation recently described in an affected Japanese boy may soon provide a molecular/causal insight into this disorder. The manifestations recorded in the previously published patients, those autopsied within recent years, and the unpublished instances in our files suggest that the CS is a heterogeneous genetic disorder, predominantly sporadic but with sufficient familial cases (at times with consanguinity) to allow postulation of an entity due to autosomal dominant mutations with a high rate of germinal mosaicism, or due to both autosomal dominant mutations and an autosomal recessive genocopy. In any event, elucidation of cause and pathogenesis of CS will, in due time, shed light on its developmental pleiotropy, rarity in liveborn infants, prevalence in stillborn fetuses, recurrence risk in humans, and occurrence in other animals (e.g., mice) to further understanding of pathogenesis.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Roifman syndrome (OMIM 300258) is a multi-system disorder with a physical phenotype that includes Beta-cell immunodeficiency, intra-uterine and postnatal growth retardation, spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, retinal dystrophy and characteristic facial dysmorphism. So far, six cases, all boys, have been reported in the literature. Roifman postulated that the syndrome may be due to a mutation in an X-linked gene or an autosomal gene giving rise to a sex-limited trait, but the definitive pathogenetic mechanism has still not been elucidated. Very little is known about the cognitive and behavioural phenotype of Roifman syndrome and no standardized measures of cognitive abilities have been reported. METHODS: We report the seventh case of a boy with Roifman syndrome and present the first systematic documentation of the cognitive and behavioural phenotype of an individual with the syndrome. RESULTS: In spite of having been reported as appearing intellectually 'able', formal evaluation showed very significant intellectual disability and neuropsychological impairment across cognitive domains. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that Roifman syndrome may be an example of an X-linked mental retardation syndrome (XLMRS).\n",
      "A pair of monozygotic twins manifested widespread ichthyosis on the trunk and extremities, mainly on the extensor surface of the lower legs. Both patients had severe developmental retardation, microcephalus, spastic quadriplegia, myoclonus, and hearing impairment. Cranial computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed diffuse cortical atrophy. Electroencephalography documented diffuse slow wave dysrhythmia and marked epileptic discharges, namely bilateral occipital dominant, and low-voltage multifocal spikes which appeared asynchronously as a burst, mainly during sleep. Skin biopsy revealed hyperkeratosis with parakeratosis. Granular cell layer was not thickened and diminished. Papillomatosis was absent. Electron microscopy did not reveal any distinctive abnormalities. Sj√É¬∂gren-Larsson syndrome and other known ichthyosis syndromes were excluded because of the difference in localization of skin lesions, skin manifestations, lack of papillomatosis, the nature and severity of neurologic symptoms and marked electroencephalographic abnormalities.\n",
      "This paper describes the presence of an interstitial pure duplication of 19p13.3 (4.95‚ÄâMb) in a patient with intellectual disability studied by array-CGH which was initially considered as a de novo alteration. The discovery of the same chromosomal alteration in a first-degree cousin of this patient led us to investigate the presence of insertional translocations, which were consequently found in three family generations. The same duplication was found in three intellectually disabled patients and among the translocation carrier family members a very high incidence of miscarriages are reported. A review of other published cases has allowed us to find three other patients with a similar pure duplication, all of them sharing some common clinical findings such as intrauterine growth retardation, microcephaly, motor and speech delay, moderate to severe intellectual disability, and dysmorphic features. These findings allow us to suggest the presence of a new microduplication syndrome in chromosomal region 19p13.3.\n",
      "We report on a female newborn baby with a \"myopathic\" stiff face, open mouth, high-arched palate, microgenia, generalized muscular hypotonia, limited extension of elbows, wrists and knees, flexed adducted thumbs, velopharyngeal insufficiency, and hypertrichosis. Death occurred at 3 months due to respiratory insufficiency. Muscular biopsy revealed myopathic abnormalities.\n",
      "Blepharophimosis-mental retardation syndromes (BMRS) include a group of clinically and etiologically heterogeneous conditions, which can occur as isolated features or as part of distinct disorders displaying multiple congenital anomalies. We report on two siblings, a 6-year-old girl and an 18-month-old male, presenting with overlapping clinical findings. Major characteristics included facial dysmorphisms with upward slanted palpebral fissures, blepharophimosis, telecanthus, hypertelorism, posteriorly rotated and abnormal ears, and micrognathia. Ectodermal abnormalities consisted of fine hair, sparse eyebrows, and thin skin. Both patients had feeding difficulties with gastro-esophageal reflux and growth retardation. Psychomotor skills were severely delayed with no verbal capacity. The male sib also displayed low growth hormone (GH) levels, while the older sister had low cholesterol and mildly elevated TSH levels. Numerous metabolic/genetic investigations, including cholesterol precursors, dosage, and high-resolution array-CGH, were negative. BMR syndromes, including Dubowitz syndrome, Marden-Walker syndrome, Ohdo/Ohdo-like syndromes, and the cholesterol storage disorders were considered. We concluded that these two patients are affected by a possible autosomal recessive condition within the heterogeneous clinical spectrum of BMRS, fitting with the Young-Simpson syndrome subtype.\n",
      "Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) with thin corpus callosum (TCC) and mental impairment is a frequent subtype of complicated HSP, often inherited as an autosomal recessive (AR) trait. It is clear from molecular genetic analyses that there are several underlying causes of this syndrome, with at least six genetic loci identified to date. However, SPG11 and SPG15 are the two major genes for this entity. To map the responsible gene in a large AR-HSP-TCC family of Tunisian origin, we investigated a consanguineous family with a diagnosis of AR-HSP-TCC excluded for linkage to the SPG7, SPG11, SPG15, SPG18, SPG21, and SPG32 loci. A genome-wide scan was undertaken using 6,090 SNP markers covering all chromosomes. The phenotypic presentation in five patients was suggestive of a complex HSP that associated an early-onset spastic paraplegia with mild handicap, mental deterioration, congenital cataract, cerebellar signs, and TCC. The genome-wide search identified a single candidate region on chromosome 9, exceeding the LOD score threshold of +3. Fine mapping using additional markers narrowed the candidate region to a 45.1-Mb interval (15.4 cM). Mutations in three candidate genes were excluded. The mapping of a novel AR-HSP-TCC locus further demonstrates the extensive genetic heterogeneity of this condition. We propose that testing for this locus should be performed, after exclusion of mutations in SPG11 and SPG15 genes, in AR-HSP-TCC families, especially when cerebellar ataxia and cataract are present.\n",
      "We present three patients with familial congenital hypertrichosis localized to the anterior cervical region, associated with peripheral sensory and motor neuropathy. This association may represent a new neurocutaneous syndrome. The association of anterior midline cutaneous lesions with an underlying malformation is discussed.\n",
      "A patient is reported with a form of epidermolysis bullosa, hitherto undescribed to the best of our knowledge, characterized by the slow centripetal progression of symmetrical blister formation, milia, scarring, atrophy, and nail dystrophy. Electron microscopy, immunofluorescence mapping, and KF-1 monoclonal antibody studies confirm this disease to be a form of dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, probably of autosomal recessive transmission despite the absence of acral deformities, contractures, mucosal involvement, and growth retardation.\n",
      "Three sibs out of four, born to unrelated parents, developed early cutaneous photosensitivity and severe colitis. All of them died from untreatable diarrhoea. A fourth boy, whose father was different, did not have the same symptoms. The origin of this syndrome remains unclear and, in particular, no metabolic defect could be detected.\n",
      "We present four children, three of them boys, affected with an identical clinical pattern consisting of early-onset ataxia, delayed dentition, hypomyelination and cerebellar atrophy. Dental radiographs showed variable absence of succedaneous teeth. Proton MR spectroscopy in one child showed elevated white matter myo-inositol. As the clinical and radiological picture in these patients is identical to that of four cases described earlier, we suggest that this disorder with ataxia, delayed dentition and hypomyelination (ADDH) represents a new entity. With the characteristic tooth abnormalities it should be straightforward to identify new patients in order to facilitate the search for the underlying genetic defect.\n",
      "BACKGROUND:A38-year-old man presented with a history of fish odor (since age 5) and unusual muscle fatigue with increased serum creatine kinase. Our aim was to identify the metabolic error in this new condition. METHODS:We used 1H NMR spectroscopy to study serum and urine from the patient. RESULTS:The concentration of N, N-dimethylglycine (DMG) was increased approximately 100-fold in the serum and approximately 20-fold in the urine. The presence of DMG as a storage product was confirmed by use of 13C NMR spectroscopy and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The high concentration of DMG was caused by a deficiency of the enzyme dimethylglycine dehydrogenase (DMGDH). A homozygous missense mutation was found in the DMGDH gene of the patient. CONCLUSIONS:DMGDH deficiency must be added to the differential diagnosis of patients complaining of a fish odor. This deficiency is the first inborn error of metabolism discovered by use of in vitro 1H NMR spectroscopy of body fluids.\n",
      "Spastic paraplegia (SPG) type 28 is an autosomal recessive SPG caused by mutations in the DDHD1 gene. We examined a Japanese 54-years-old male patient with autosomal recessive SPG. His parents were consanguineous. He needed a wheelchair for transfer due to spastic paraplegia. There was a history of operations for bilateral hallux valgus, thoracic ossification of the yellow ligament, bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, bilateral ankle contracture, and lumbar spinal canal stenosis. He noticed gait disturbance at age 14. He used a cane for walking in his 40s. On neurological examination, he showed hyperreflexia, spasticity, and weakness in the lower extremities and bilateral Babinski reflexes. Urinary dysfunctions and impaired vibration sense in the lower limbs were observed. By exome sequencing analysis using Agilent SureSelect and Illumina MiSeq, we identified 17,248 homozygous nucleotide variants in the patient. Through the examination of 48 candidate genes known to be responsible for autosomal recessive SPG, we identified a novel homozygous 4-bp deletion, c.914_917delGTAA, p.Ser305Ilefs*2 in exon2 of the DDHD1 gene encoding phosphatidic acid-preferring phospholipase A1 (PA-PLA1). The mutation is expected to cause a frameshift generating a premature stop codon 3-bp downstream from the deletion. In consequence, the DDHD domain that is known to be critical for PLA1 activity is completely depleted in the mutated DDHD1 protein, predicted to be a functionally null mutation of the DDHD1 gene. By Sanger sequencing, we confirmed that both parents are heterozygous for the mutation. This variation was not detected in 474 Japanese control subjects as well as the data of the 1,000G Project. We conclude that the novel mutation in DDHD1 is the causative variant for the SPG28 patient that is the first record of the disease in Japanese population.\n",
      "We report on 2 sibs with generalized hypotonia, developmental retardation, unilateral radio-ulnar synostosis, and a characteristic facial appearance. We propose that they have a new autosomal recessive syndrome.\n",
      "We report on 4 boys (3 in one family) who have a remarkably constant syndrome of childhood-onset choreoathetosis with later spasticity, postnatal microcephaly, growth and mental retardation, apparent external ophthalmoplegia and varying degrees of deafness. The pedigrees are consistent with X-linked inheritance. The syndrome is compared and contrasted with others comprising basal ganglion dysfunction in childhood. It is concluded that clinically and genetically the condition is unique.\n",
      "Orthostatic intolerance is a syndrome characterized by lightheadedness, fatigue, altered mentation, and syncope and associated with postural tachycardia and plasma norepinephrine concentrations that are disproportionately high in relation to sympathetic outflow. We tested the hypothesis that impaired functioning of the norepinephrine transporter contributes to the pathophysiologic mechanism of orthostatic intolerance.In a patient with orthostatic intolerance and her relatives, we measured postural blood pressure, heart rate, plasma catecholamines, and systemic norepinephrine spillover and clearance, and we sequenced the norepinephrine-transporter gene and evaluated its function.The patient had a high mean plasma norepinephrine concentration while standing, as compared with the mean (+/-SD) concentration in normal subjects (923 vs. 439+/-129 pg per milliliter [5.46 vs. 2.59+/-0.76 nmol per liter]), reduced systemic norepinephrine clearance (1.56 vs. 2.42+/-0.71 liters per minute), impairment in the increase in the plasma norepinephrine concentration after the administration of tyramine (12 vs. 56+/-63 pg per milliliter [0.07 vs. 0.33+/-0.37 pmol per liter]), and a disproportionate increase in the concentration of plasma norepinephrine relative to that of dihydroxyphenylglycol. Analysis of the norepinephrine-transporter gene revealed that the proband was heterozygous for a mutation in exon 9 (encoding a change from guanine to cytosine at position 237) that resulted in more than a 98 percent loss of function as compared with that of the wild-type gene. Impairment of synaptic norepinephrine clearance may result in a syndrome characterized by excessive sympathetic activation in response to physiologic stimuli. The mutant allele in the proband's family segregated with the postural heart rate and abnormal plasma catecholamine homeostasis.Genetic or acquired deficits in norepinephrine inactivation may underlie hyperadrenergic states that lead to orthostatic intolerance.\n",
      "A daughter of second cousins is described as having lipoatrophic diabetes, unusual facial appearance, generalized hypotrichosis, two natal teeth with enamel dysplasia, eruption of four dysplastic deciduous teeth, absence of permanent dentition, low birth weight, short stature, lumbar scoliosis, renal alterations, aplasia of a breast and hypoplasia of the other, hypoplastic and hypopigmented areolae with diffuse limits, hyperostosis of the cranial vault, metacarpal hypoplasias, difficulty of grasping with the left hand, exertional dyspnea, absence of DIP extension and flexion creases, dermatoglyphic alterations, and other anomalies. Her sister, dead at 1 1/2 years, had had some manifestations of the condition; seven sibs are normal. It is more likely that the whole clinical picture represents a single syndrome rather than homozygosity of different autosomal-recessive genes.\n",
      "We describe two sibs with prenatal-onset growth deficiency, microcephaly, cataracts, mental retardation, enamel hypoplasia, immune deficiency, and generalized delay of ossification. The combination appears to constitute a previously undescribed autosomal recessive syndrome.\n",
      "2q23.1 microdeletion syndrome is a recently characterized chromosomal aberration disorder uncovered through array comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH). Although the cardinal feature is intellectual disability (ID), neurodevelopmental features of the syndrome have not been systematically reviewed. We present a 5-year-old boy with severe psychomotor developmental delay/ID, progressive microcephaly with brain atrophy, growth retardation, and several external anomalies. He manifested intractable epilepsy, effectively treated with combined antiepileptic drug therapy including topiramate. Array CGH demonstrated a de novo interstitial deletion of approximately 1‚ÄâMb at 2q23.1-q23.2, involving four genes including MBD5. Nineteen patients have been reported to have the syndrome, including present patient. All patients whose data were available had ID, 17 patients (89%) had seizures, and microcephaly was evident in 9 of 18 patients (50%). Deletion sizes ranged from 200‚Äâkb to 5.5‚ÄâMb, comprising 1-15 genes. MBD5, the only gene deleted in all patients, is considered to be responsible for ID and epilepsy. Furthermore, the deletion junction was sequenced for the first time in a patient with the syndrome; and homology of three nucleotides, identified at the distal and proximal breakpoints, suggested that the deletion might have been mediated by recently-delineated genomic rearrangement mechanism Fork Stalling and Template Switching (FoSTeS)/microhomology-mediated break-induced replication (MMBIR).\n",
      "The authors present three patients from a consanguineous family afflicted with novel recessive myoclonic epilepsy characterized by very early onset and a steadily progressive course. The onset is in early infancy, and death occurs in the first decade. In addition to various types of myoclonic seizures, episodic phenomena such as dystonias, postictal enduring hemipareses, autonomic involvements, and periods of obtundation and lethargy were also observed. Developmental and neurological retardation, coupled with systemic infections, leads to a full deterioration. The authors designated the disease progressive myoclonic epilepsy with dystonia (PMED). A genome scan for the family and subsequent fine mapping localized the gene responsible for the disease to the most telomeric 6.73 mega base pairs at the p-terminus of chromosome 16, with a maximum multipoint logarithm-of-odds score of 7.83 and a maximum two-point score of 4.25. A candidate gene was analyzed for mutations in patients, but no mutation was found.\n",
      "We describe a 16-year-old girl who presented with a 3-year history of telangiectatic patches on the extremities and trunk. Skin biopsies demonstrated dilated vessels with thickened walls containing hyaline material in the papillary dermis, resembling those seen in systemic amyloidosis, porphyrias, or lipoid proteinosis. A diagnosis of cutaneous collagenous vasculopathy was made. To our knowledge, cutaneous collagenous vasculopathy has previously only been described in adults aged 50 and older.\n",
      "We report on a newborn infant with characteristics of Laurin-Sandrow syndrome (LSS). She had hypertelorism, flat nose with grooved collumella, \"V\" shaped mouth with thin lips, 7 well-recognized and fused digits and 1 additional postaxial bilateral appendix on each hand. The right and left feet had 12 and 11 toes, respectively, the 4 external ones were recognizable, and the rest were fused in a uniform mass but with independent nails. There was also a 2.3 cm-long digitiform appendix in the internal part of both feet. Radiographs showed seven metacarpals and seven metatarsals with similar morphology; both hands lacking thumbs. The four lateral-most toes had regular shaped phalanges and the rest were irregular. The left digitiform appendix had three bones and the right only two. Tibiae were shorter than fibulae. Central Nervous System examination showed an abnormally shaped olivary nucleus, cerebellar cortical heterotopias, gray matter ectopias in both spinal cord and hemispheric white matter, marked ventricular dilatation, and moderate diffuse white matter gliosis. Karyotype was 46XX. A complete necropsy study is presented and all reported cases are reviewed focusing on their phenotypic differences and their nosologic classification. We propose the entity LSS only in cases with symmetric tetrameric polysyndactyly, especially cup-shaped hands and mirror feet, in association with nasal anomalies.\n",
      "Two siblings, a 17 year-old female and a 15 year-old boy, with a hitherto unidentified malformation syndrome are reported. Both presented with corneal clouding, subvalvular aortic stenosis, midfacial hypoplasia, skeletal anomalies, and a variable degree of growth- and mental retardation.\n",
      "Several inherited disorders of fatty acid beta-oxidation have been described that relate mainly to saturated precursors. This study is the first report of an enzyme defect related only to unsaturated fatty acid oxidation and provides the first in vivo evidence that fat oxidation in humans proceeds by the reductase-dependent pathway. The patient was a black female, presenting in the neonatal period with persistent hypotonia. Biochemical studies revealed hyperlysinemia, hypocarnitinemia, normal organic acid profile, and an unusual acylcarnitine species in both urine and blood. The new metabolite was positively identified by mass spectrometry as 2-trans,4-cis-decadienoylcarnitine, derived from incomplete oxidation of linoleic acid. In spite of dietary therapy, the patient died of respiratory acidosis at four months of age. Samples of liver and muscle from the autopsy were assayed for 2,4-dienoyl-coenzyme A reductase activity. Using the substrate 2-trans,4-cis-decadienoylcoenzyme A, the reductase activity was 40% of the control value in liver and only 17% of that found in normal muscle. It is suggested that unsaturated substrates should be used for in vitro testing to cover the full range of potential beta-oxidation defects and that acylcarnitine species identification be used for in vivo detection of this disorder.\n",
      "We report on two new cases of syndromic lissencephaly in two consanguineous sibs, with skeletal abnormality, born to young, healthy, second cousin parents with healthy children. In Case 1, fetal ultrasound screening at 32 weeks of gestation showed microcephaly, skin infiltration and equinovarus feet. MRI disclosed cerebral agyria, hypoplastic cerebral mantle and posterior agenesis of the corpus callosum. The propositus, a boy, died soon after birth at term. In Case 2, fetal ultrasound study performed at 16 weeks of gestation disclosed skin infiltration. MRI at 22 weeks of gestation showed microcephaly with agenesis of corpus callosum and cerebellar hypoplasia. Pregnancy was terminated at 22 weeks of gestation. The fetus had normal 46, XY karyotype and similar anomalies found in the index case, with cranio-facial edema and arthrogryposis. X-ray films showed epiphyseal stippling of cervical vertebrae, feet and sacrum. Metacarpal bones were shortened with hypoplastic distal phalanges. Neuropathological findings were concordant with the pattern described in type III lissencephaly: an agyric brain with hypoplastic brain stem and cerebellum, severe neuronal loss of the cortical plate, matrix zone, basal ganglia, brainstem nuclei and spinal cord with axonal swelling and microcalcification. This entity seems to be a new syndromic lissencephaly type III, because of epiphyseal calcifications and metacarpophalangeal bone dysplasia.\n",
      "We report two daughters of a Thai family affected with mental retardation, delayed speech, obesity, craniofacial manifestations, and ocular anomalies. Craniofacial manifestations included macrocephaly, maxillary hypoplasia, mandibular prognathism, and crowding of teeth. Ocular anomalies consisted of blepharophimosis, blepharoptosis, decreased visual acuity, abducens palsy, hyperopic astigmatism, and accommodative esotropia. Chronic atopic dermatitis, lateral deviation of the great toes, and cone-shaped epiphyses of the toes were observed. The disorder is suggested to be autosomal recessive. The combination of findings found in our patients has not hitherto been described.\n",
      "Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is clinically and genetically a heterogeneous disorder of connective tissue. Eleven different types of EDS have been documented, several of which have major cardiovascular complications as part of their clinical manifestations. The purpose of this report is to call attention to a form of EDS with minimal external features but severe internal vascular complications.\n",
      "Defects in glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan are associated with several forms of muscular dystrophies. Mutations in POMT2 gene have been identified in patients with congenital muscular dystrophy and brain involvement, either characterized by a Walker-Warburg/muscle-eye-brain phenotype, or by microcephaly, mental retardation, and cerebellar hypoplasia. We identified a POMT2 homozygous missense mutation in a girl with a mild limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) phenotype, marked elevated serum creatine kinase levels, and absence of brain involvement. Muscle biopsy revealed myopathic and inflammatory changes and severe alpha-dystroglycan reduction. In view of the remarkable mild clinical picture, we propose to designate this phenotype as LGMD2N.\n",
      "Five members of a kindred with brachydactyly and distal symphalangism, normal stature, pes cavus, and scoliosis were ascertained. The pedigree was consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance. The combination of clinical and radiological features is believed to be distinct from those previously reported in patients with brachydactyly/symphalangism.\n",
      "The conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex consists of eight subunits and plays a crucial role in Golgi trafficking and positioning of glycosylation enzymes. Mutations in all COG subunits, except subunit 3, have been detected in patients with congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) of variable severity. So far, 3 families with a total of 10 individuals with biallelic COG6 mutations have been described, showing a broad clinical spectrum. Here we present 7 additional patients with 4 novel COG6 mutations. In spite of clinical variability, we delineate the core features of COG6-CDG i.e. liver involvement (9/10), microcephaly (8/10), developmental disability (8/10), recurrent infections (7/10), early lethality (6/10), and hypohidrosis predisposing for hyperthermia (6/10) and hyperkeratosis (4/10) as ectodermal signs. Regarding all COG6-related disorders a genotype-phenotype correlation can be discerned ranging from deep intronic mutations found in Shaheen syndrome as the mildest form to loss-of-function mutations leading to early lethal CDG phenotypes. A comparison with other COG deficiencies suggests ectodermal changes to be a hallmark of COG6-related disorders. Our findings aid clinical differentiation of this complex group of disorders and imply subtle functional differences between the COG complex subunits.\n",
      "We describe a large inbred Syrian pedigree with an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder. The clinical picture of the affected patients is oligodontia, and a degenerative neurological condition with onset around age 12, characterized by progressive ataxia and pyramidal syndrome. Abnormalities in the white matter and cortical atrophy were assessed by magnetic resonance imaging. Differential diagnosis and the possibility of a fortuitous association or the report of a hitherto unreported dento-leukoencephalopathy are discussed.\n",
      "We report a 9 year old girl with microcephaly and self-limiting dilated cardiomyopathy. Additional features include mental retardation, delayed developmental milestones, and minor dysmorphic features. This is the second reported case of this phenotype, which is believed to be a new autosomal recessive syndrome.\n",
      "To describe the Alzheimer disease (AD)-like clinical and pathological features, including marked neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) pathology, of a familial prion disease due to a rare nonsense mutation of the prion gene (PRNP).Longitudinal clinical assessments were available for the proband and her mother. After death, both underwent neuropathological evaluation. PRNP was sequenced after failure to find immunopositive AŒ≤ deposits in the proband and the documentation of prion protein (PrP) immunopositive pathology.The proband presented at age 42 years with a 3-year history of progressive short-term memory impairment and depression. Neuropsychological testing found impaired memory performance, with relatively preserved attention and construction. She was diagnosed with AD and died at age 47 years. Neuropathologic evaluation revealed extensive limbic and neocortical NFT formation and neuritic plaques consistent with a Braak stage of VI. The NFTs were immunopositive, with multiple tau antibodies, and electron microscopy revealed paired helical filaments. However, the neuritic plaques were immunonegative for AŒ≤, whereas immunostaining for PrP was positive. The mother of the proband had a similar presentation, including depression, and had been diagnosed clinically and pathologically as AD. Reevaluation of her brain tissue confirmed similar tau and PrP immunostaining findings. Genetic analysis revealed that both the proband and her mother had a rare PRNP mutation (Q160X) that resulted in the production of truncated PrP.We suggest that PRNP mutations that result in a truncation of PrP lead to a prolonged clinical course consistent with a clinical diagnosis of AD and severe AD-like NFTs.\n",
      "MEHMO (Mental retardation, Epileptic seizures, Hypogenitalism, Microcephaly and Obesity) is an X-linked disorder characterised by mental retardation, epileptic seizures, hypogenitalism, microcephaly and obesity. It was recently assigned to the locus Xp21.1-p22.13. We describe a child with MEHMO and lactic acidosis whose muscle biopsy revealed markedly reduced activities of complexes 1,3 and 4 of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. Histological staining showed mitochondrial proliferation and lipid storage. Electron microscopy revealed abnormal and enlarged mitochondria with concentric cristae and electron dense bodies. This is the first identification of MEHMO as a mitochondrial disorder and one of the very few X-linked mitochondrial syndromes.\n",
      "A 19-year-old female with ectodermal dysplasia, lipoatrophy, diabetes mellitus, and amastia is described. This complex of symptoms is very similar to that of a case published by Pinheiro et al [1983] under the acronym of AREDYLD syndrome.\n",
      "A family of ten individuals aged 18 months to 75 years had biomicroscopic findings consisting of large, amorphous, sheet-like opacifications of the posterior stroma and Descemet's membrane, and alterations of the endothelium. A uniform thinning of the cornea was present. These findings do not conform to previously described corneal dystrophies. The condition appears minimally progressive and the three-generation pedigree indicated an autosomal-dominant inheritance pattern.\n",
      "A 27-yr-old woman with lifelong severe exercise intolerance manifested by muscle fatigue, lactic acidosis, and prominent symptoms of dyspnea and tachycardia induced by trivial exercise was found to have a skeletal muscle respiratory chain defect characterized by low levels of reducible cytochromes a + a3 and b in muscle mitochondria and marked deficiency of cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV) as assessed biochemically and immunologically. Investigation of the pathophysiology of the exercise response in the patient revealed low maximal oxygen uptake (1/3 that of normal sedentary women) in cycle exercise and impaired muscle oxygen extraction as indicated by profoundly low maximal systemic arteriovenous oxygen difference (5.8 ml/dl; controls = 15.4 +/- 1.4, mean +/- SD). The increases in cardiac output and ventilation during exercise, normally closely coupled to muscle metabolic rate, were markedly exaggerated (more than two- to threefold normal) relative to oxygen uptake and carbon dioxide production accounting for prominent tachycardia and dyspnea at low workloads. Symptoms in our patient are similar to those reported in other human skeletal muscle respiratory chain defects involving complexes I and III, and the exaggerated circulatory response resembles that seen during experimental inhibition of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. These results suggest that impaired oxidative phosphorylation in working muscle disrupts the normal regulation of cardiac output and ventilation relative to muscle metabolic rate in exercise.\n",
      "BACKGROUND:The first subjects with deficiency of mitochondrial tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (WARS2) were reported¬†in 2017. Their clinical characteristics can be subdivided into three phenotypes (neonatal phenotype, severe infantile onset phenotype, Parkinson-like phenotype). RESULTS:Here, we report on a subject who presented with early developmental delay, motor weakness and intellectual disability and who was considered during several years as having a non-progressive encephalopathy. At the age of six years, she had an epileptic seizure which was treated with sodium valproate. In the months after treatment was started, she developed acute liver failure and severe progressive encephalopathy. Although valproate was discontinued, she died six months later. Spectrophotometric analysis of the oxidative phosphorylation complexes in liver revealed a deficient activity of complex III and low normal activities of the complexes I and IV. Activity staining in the BN-PAGE gel confirmed the low activities of complex I, III and IV and, in addition, showed the presence of a subcomplex of complex V. Histochemically, a mosaic pattern was seen in hepatocytes after cytochrome c oxidase staining. Using Whole Exome Sequencing two known pathogenic variants were detected in WARS2 (c.797delC, p.Pro266ArgfsTer10/ c.938 A¬†>¬†T, p.Lys313Met). CONCLUSION:This is the first report of severe hepatopathy in a subject with WARS2 deficiency. The hepatopathy occurred soon after start of sodium valproate treatment. In the literature, valproate-induced hepatotoxicity was reported in the subjects with pathogenic mutations in POLG and TWNK. This case report illustrates that the course of the disease in the subjects with a mitochondrial defect can be non-progressive during several years. The subject reported here was first diagnosed as having cerebral palsy. Only after a mitochondriotoxic medication was started, the disease became progressive, and the diagnosis of a mitochondrial defect was made.\n",
      "Fanconi-Bickel syndrome (FBS, OMIM 227810) is a rare type of glycogen storage disease (GSD). It is caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations within GLUT2, the gene encoding the most important facilitative glucose transporter in hepatocytes, pancreatic beta-cells, enterocytes, and renal tubular cells. To date, 112 patients have been reported in the literature. Most patients have the typical combination of clinical symptoms: hepatomegaly secondary to glycogen accumulation, glucose and galactose intolerance, fasting hypoglycemia, a characteristic tubular nephropathy, and severely stunted growth. In 63 patients, mutation analysis has revealed a total of 34 different GLUT2 mutations with none of them being particularly frequent. No specific therapy is available for FBS patients. Symptomatic treatment is directed towards a stabilization of glucose homeostasis and compensation for renal losses of various solutes. In addition to the clinical and molecular genetic aspects of FBS, this review discusses the pathophysiology of the disease and compares it to recent findings in GLUT2 deficient transgenic animals. An overview is also provided on recently discovered members of the rapidly growing family of facilitative glucose transporters, which are novel candidates for congenital disorders of carbohydrate metabolism.\n",
      "Many patients with maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 7 (UPD7) have been described, mainly with intrauterine and postnatal growth retardation or with Silver-Russell syndrome. In contrast, only three cases of paternal UPD7 have been reported, all associated with recessive disorders. Here, we report on the clinical and molecular data of the third patient with paternal UPD7 and cystic fibrosis. Pre- and postnatal growth were normal. These findings support the hypothesis that paternal isodisomy for human chromosome 7 may have no phenotypic effect on growth.\n",
      "We report on a consanguineous Lebanese family in which two sibs had pre- and post-natal growth retardation, developmental delay, large anterior fontanel, prominent forehead, low-set ears, depressed nasal bridge, short nose, anteverted nares, increased nasal width, prominent abdomen, and short limbs. Radiographs disclosed the presence of wormian bones, platyspondyly, decreased interpedicular distance at the lumbar vertebrae, square iliac bones, horizontal acetabula, trident acetabula, hypoplastic ischia, partial agenesis of the sacrum, ribs with cupped ends, short long bones with abnormal modeling, slight widening of the distal femoral metaphyses, and delayed epiphyseal ossification. Both sibs had a severe cardiomegaly and died at around 24 months from a heart failure. Differential diagnosis suggests that this is a second family presenting a newly described early lethal chondrodysplasia first reported by [M√©garban√© et al. (2008); Am J Med Genet Part A 146A:2916-2919].\n",
      "Inherited immune deficiencies are a heterogeneous group of diseases that can be either isolated, with the immune defect being the exclusive manifestation, or associated with other abnormalities. We report on two sisters, born to consanguineous parents of Sri-Lankan descent, who presented in infancy with immunodeficiency, gonadal dysgenesis, and fatal lung fibrosis. Immune studies demonstrated combined humoral and cellular abnormalities including reduced immunoglobulin production, an absence of lymphoid tissue, markedly reduced T-lymphocyte numbers and function and reduced newly thymus-derived T-cells. Both infants succumbed to rapidly progressive lung fibrosis. Autopsy showed dysgenetic gonads bearing no discernible oocytes. In both, karyotypes were normal female (46,XX). Comparative genome hybridization and analysis of genes known to be associated with severe immune defects in infancy or gonadal dysgenesis showed no abnormality. The distinct findings in these two sisters have not been reported before and thus suggest a hitherto unknown autosomal recessive condition that includes immune dysfunction, gonadal dysgenesis, and pulmonary fibrosis.\n",
      "We report on sibs, the offspring of a consanguineous mating, whose mesomelic shortness and bowing of limbs with associated skin dimpling, retrognathia, mandibular hypoplasia, cleft palate, and camptodactyly represents a previously apparently unreported syndrome. The radiological findings are discussed, particularly with regard to the main known diagnostic possibilities.\n",
      "BACKGROUND:Galloway-Mowat syndrome (GAMOS) is a rare hereditary renal-neurological disease characterized by early-onset steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome in combination with microcephaly and brain anomalies. Recently, novel causative mutations for this disease have been identified in the genes encoding the four KEOPS subunits: OSGEP, TP53RK, TPRKB, and LAGE3. CASE PRESENTATION:We detected a novel homozygous TP53RK mutation (NM_033550, c.194A‚Äâ>‚ÄâT, p.Lys65Met) using whole exome sequencing in a familial case of GAMOS with three affected siblings. All three patients manifested similar phenotypes, including very early-onset nephrotic syndrome (8¬†days, 1¬†day, and 1¬†day after birth, respectively), microcephaly, dysmorphic faces, and early fatality (10¬†months, 21¬†days, and 25¬†days of age, respectively). One patient also showed hiatal hernia with gastric volvulus. Renal biopsy performed on one patient revealed focal segmental glomerulosclerosis with severe tubulo-interstitial changes. CONCLUSION:We report on a familial case of GAMOS with three affected siblings carrying a novel homozygous TP53RK mutation. To our knowledge, this is only the second report on GAMOS in association with a TP53RK mutation.\n",
      "Microdeletions of 17q24.2-q24.3 have been described in several patients with developmental and speech delay, growth retardation, and other features. The relatively large size and limited overlap of the deletions complicate the genotype-phenotype correlation. We identified a girl with intellectual disability, growth retardation, dysmorphic features, and a de novo 2.8 Mb long deletion of 17q24.2-q24.3. Her phenotype was strikingly similar to one previously described boy with Dubowitz syndrome (MIM 223370) and a de novo 3.9 Mb long deletion encompassing the deletion of our patient. In addition, both patients had the shortest telomeres among normal age-matched controls. Our review of all 17q24.2-q24.3 deletion patients revealed additional remarkable phenotypic features shared by the patients, some of which have consequences for their management. Proposed novel genotype-phenotype correlations based on new literature information on the region include the role of PSMD12 and BPTF, the genes recently associated with syndromic neurodevelopmental disorders, and a possible role of the complex topologically associated domain structure of the region, which may explain some of the phenotypic discrepancies observed between patients with similar but not identical deletions. Nevertheless, although different diagnoses including the Dubowitz, Nijmegen breakage (MIM 251260), Silver-Russell (MIM 180860), or Myhre (MIM 139210) syndromes were originally considered in the 17q24.2-q24.3 deletion patients, they clearly belong to one diagnostic entity defined by their deletions and characterized especially by developmental delay, specific facial dysmorphism, abnormalities of extremities and other phenotypes, and possibly also short telomere length.\n",
      "We used whole-exome sequencing to study three individuals with a distinct condition characterized by short stature, chondrodysplasia with brachydactyly, congenital joint dislocations, cleft palate, and facial dysmorphism. Affected individuals carried homozygous missense mutations in IMPAD1, the gene coding for gPAPP, a Golgi-resident nucleotide phosphatase that hydrolyzes phosphoadenosine phosphate (PAP), the byproduct of sulfotransferase reactions, to AMP. The mutations affected residues in or adjacent to the phosphatase active site and are predicted to impair enzyme activity. A fourth unrelated patient was subsequently found to be homozygous for a premature termination codon in IMPAD1. Impad1 inactivation in mice has previously been shown to produce chondrodysplasia with abnormal joint formation and impaired proteoglycan sulfation. The human chondrodysplasia associated with gPAPP deficiency joins a growing number of skeletoarticular conditions associated with defective synthesis of sulfated proteoglycans, highlighting the importance of proteoglycans in the development of skeletal elements and joints.\n",
      "We report on 2 unrelated fetuses with a multiple congenital anomaly pattern of severe limb deficiencies, vertebral/rib alterations, and mirror polydactyly similar to that described previously by us [Urioste et al., Hum Genet 97:214-217, 1996]. In addition, the two cases we present here have a more extense alteration of blastogenesis, expanding the phenotype of the cases previously reported. We have suggested [Urioste et al., Hum Genet 97:214-217, 1996] that this condition may be caused by a mutation in a developmental control gene that affects body-plan organization. The minimal estimate of the prevalence of this new entity in our population (the Spanish Collaborative Study of Congenital Malformations, ECEMC) is 3.0/ 1,000,000 live births.\n",
      "In this report we have described an affected sib in a large Turkish family who appears to have a new distinct dominantly-inherited blindness, scoliosis and arachnodactyly syndrome. The combination of clinical abnormalities in these patients did not initially suggest Marfan syndrome or other connective tissue disorders associated with ectopia lentis. The proband was a 16-year-old boy who was referred to our clinics for scoliosis. He had arachnodactyly of both fingers and toes. He had been suffering from progressive visual loss and strabismus since he was eight-years-old. His 20-year-old brother had severe kyphoscoliosis, and arachnodactyly of fingers and toes. He was 130 cm tall and was bilaterally blind. His 23-year-old sister had only eye findings but no arachnodactyly or scoliosis. His 60-year-old father had mild scoliosis, blindness and arachnodactyly and mother was normal. We performed routine mutation analyses in the genes FBN1, TGFBR1 and TGFBR2, but no mutation has been detected. Our Turkish patients are most likely affected by a hitherto unrecorded condition which is caused by an autosomal dominant gene defect with variable expression but we can not exclude multigenic inheritance. Further studies are needed to assess the contribution of sex influence to the syndrome because the female relative is less affected.\n",
      "Char syndrome is characterized by persistent patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) associated with hand-skeletal abnormalities and distinctive facial dysmorphism. Pathogenic variants in the transcription factor gene TFAP2B have been shown to cause Char syndrome; however, there is significant phenotypic variability linked to variant location. Here, we report a pediatric patient with a novel de novo variant in the fifth exon of TFAP2B, c.917C‚Äâ>‚ÄâT (p.Thr306Met), who presented with PDA, patent foramen ovale, postaxial polydactyly of the left fifth toe and clinodactyly of the left fourth toe, sensorineural hearing loss, scoliosis, dental anomalies, and central diabetes insipidus (CDI). CDI, scoliosis, and hearing loss have not previously been reported in a patient with Char syndrome, and while the association may be coincidental, this report expands the genotypes and potentially phenotypes associated with this syndrome.\n",
      "A peculiar form of metaphyseal dysplasia, mainly of the lower limbs, occurred in two male siblings born to healthy, unrelated parents. The clinical and radiological features were short stature, psychomotor retardation, accelerated bone maturation, the limbs and especially the knees showing cup-shaped widening of the ends of the metaphyses and wedge-shaped widening of the epiphyses. This condition does not fit the description of any syndrome reported so far and may therefore be classified as a new recessive dysplasia.\n",
      "We describe a father and his son with bilateral absence of radius and thumb. Both have short stature, external ear malformation, and renal anomaly. In the son a high frequency of chromosome breaks in lymphocytes was found. We compare this familial syndrome to Fanconi anemia and other radial ray aplasia syndromes and conclude that we are dealing with a different entity, which apparently is inherited as a dominant trait.\n",
      "Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome (HPS) is an autosomal-recessive condition characterized by oculocutaneous albinism and a bleeding diathesis due to absent platelet delta granules. HPS is a genetically heterogeneous disorder of intracellular vesicle biogenesis. We first screened all our patients with HPS-like symptoms for mutations in the genes responsible for HPS-1 through HPS-6 and found no functional mutations in 38 individuals. We then examined all eight genes encoding the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex-1, or BLOC-1, proteins in these individuals. This identified a homozygous nonsense mutation in PLDN in a boy with characteristic features of HPS. PLDN is mutated in the HPS mouse model pallid and encodes the protein pallidin, which interacts with the early endosomal t-SNARE syntaxin-13. We could not detect any full-length pallidin in our patient's cells despite normal mRNA expression of the mutant transcript. We could detect an alternative transcript that would skip the exon that harbored the mutation, but we demonstrate that if this transcript is translated into protein, although it correctly localizes to early endosomes, it does not interact with syntaxin-13. In our patient's melanocytes, the melanogenic protein TYRP1 showed aberrant localization, an increase in plasma-membrane trafficking, and a failure to reach melanosomes, explaining the boy's severe albinism and establishing his diagnosis as HPS-9.\n",
      "The molecular mechanisms that underlie T-cell quiescence are poorly understood. In the present study, we report a primary immunodeficiency phenotype associated with MST1 deficiency and primarily characterized by a progressive loss of naive T cells. The in vivo consequences include recurrent bacterial and viral infections and autoimmune manifestations. MST1-deficient T cells poorly expressed the transcription factor FOXO1, the IL-7 receptor, and BCL2. Conversely, FAS expression and the FAS-mediating apoptotic pathway were up-regulated. These abnormalities suggest that increased cell death of naive and proliferating T cells is the main mechanism underlying this novel immunodeficiency. Our results characterize a new mechanism in primary T-cell immunodeficiencies and highlight a role of the MST1/FOXO1 pathway in controlling the death of human naive T cells.\n",
      "In 1979, Rasmussen et al. reported six members of a family with congenital, bilateral, symmetrical, and isolated subtotal atresia of the external auditory canal, bilateral foot abnormalities, and increased interocular distance. The family history suggested autosomal dominant inheritance of the syndrome. We report a 3-year-old girl whose symptoms are compatible with this diagnosis. Therefore, we suggest confirmation of the description by Rasmussen et al. as a distinct entity and suggest the term Rasmussen syndrome for this condition.\n",
      "Sarcomas of the uterine cervix are uncommon tumours arising from uterine cervix constituting less than 1% of all cervical malignancies. Leiomyosarcoma of uterine cervix is extremely rare. Combined modality of treatment including surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy should be used in these patients to achieve better survival. We present a rare case of leiomyosarcoma of uterine cervix presented with bleeding per vaginam and bulky cervical mass. Simple hysterectomy was carried out and operative findings revealed a large growth arising from the anterior cervical lip. Diagnosis in this case was made by subjecting the resected specimen to histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis. Postoperatively patient received adjuvant combination chemotherapy (VAC) followed by radiotherapy. Patient is asymptomatic without any evidence of tumour recurrence after 6 months of follow-up.\n",
      "Infantile systemic hyalinosis (ISH) is an extremely rare genodermatosis, characterized by thickened skin, joint contractures and subcutaneous nodules. ISH is caused by mutations in the CMG2 gene, which encodes a protein of unknown function. In this report, we describe a patient with ISH, who was a twin born to a consanguineous Iranian couple, and who demonstrated unusual skin findings in addition to the characteristic features of ISH. Mutation analysis disclosed a homozygous deletion mutation, c.1074delT in CMG2, resulting in a frameshift and premature termination codon 50 amino acids downstream of the deletion. This information adds to the recurring nature of this mutation in ISH, with implications for genetic counselling in extended families with a history of this disease.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Signals emanating from the antigen T-cell receptor (TCR) are required for T-cell development and function. The T lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase (Lck) is a key component of the TCR signaling machinery. On the basis of its function, we considered LCK a candidate gene in patients with combined immunodeficiency. OBJECTIVE: We identify and describe a child with a T-cell immunodeficiency caused by a homozygous missense mutation of the LCK gene (c.1022T>C) resulting from uniparental disomy. METHODS: Genetic, molecular, and functional analyses were performed to characterize the Lck deficiency, and the associated clinical and immunologic phenotypes are reported. RESULTS: The mutant LCK protein (p.L341P) was weakly expressed with no kinase activity and failed to reconstitute TCR signaling in LCK-deficient T cells. The patient presented with recurrent respiratory tract infections together with predominant early-onset inflammatory and autoimmune manifestations. The patient displayed CD4(+) T-cell lymphopenia and low levels of CD4 and CD8 expression on the T-cell surface. The residual T lymphocytes had an oligoclonal T-cell repertoire and exhibited a profound TCR signaling defect, with only weak tyrosine phosphorylation signals and no Ca(2+) mobilization in response to TCR stimulation. CONCLUSION: We report a new form of T-cell immunodeficiency caused by a LCK gene defect, highlighting the essential role of Lck in human T-cell development and responses. Our results also point out that defects in the TCR signaling cascade often result in abnormal T-cell differentiation and functions, leading to an important risk factor for inflammation and autoimmunity.\n",
      "Genetic disorders of excessive salt loss from sweat glands have been observed in pseudohypoaldosteronism type I (PHA) and cystic fibrosis that result from mutations in genes encoding epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) subunits and the transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), respectively. We identified a novel autosomal recessive form of isolated salt wasting in sweat, which leads to severe infantile hyponatremic dehydration. Three affected individuals from a small Bedouin clan presented with failure to thrive, hyponatremic dehydration and hyperkalemia with isolated sweat salt wasting. Using positional cloning, we identified the association of a Glu143Lys mutation in carbonic anhydrase 12 (CA12) with the disease. Carbonic anhydrase is a zinc metalloenzyme that catalyzes the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide to form a bicarbonate anion and a proton. Glu143 in CA12 is essential for zinc coordination in this metalloenzyme and lowering of the protein-metal affinity reduces its catalytic activity. This is the first presentation of an isolated loss of salt from sweat gland mimicking PHA, associated with a mutation in the CA12 gene not previously implicated in human disorders. Our data demonstrate the importance of bicarbonate anion and proton production on salt concentration in sweat and its significance for sodium homeostasis.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: Mutations in SLC2A1, encoding the glucose transporter type 1 (GLUT1), cause a broad spectrum of neurologic disorders including classic GLUT1 deficiency syndrome, paroxysmal exercise-induced dyskinesia (PED, DYT18), and absence epilepsy. A large German/Dutch pedigree has formerly been described as paroxysmal choreoathetosis/spasticity (DYT9) and linked close to but not including the SLC2A1 locus on chromosome 1p. We tested whether 1) progressive spastic paraparesis, in addition to PED, as described in DYT9, and 2) autosomal dominant forms of hereditary spastic paraparesis (HSP) without PED are caused by SLC2A1 defects. METHODS: The German/Dutch family and an Australian monozygotic twin pair were clinically (re-)investigated, and 139 index cases with dominant or sporadic HSP in which relevant dominant genes were partially excluded were identified from databanks. SLC2A1 was sequenced in all cases in this observational study and the functional effects of identified sequence variations were tested in glucose uptake and protein expression assays. RESULTS: We identified causative mutations in SLC2A1 in both families, which were absent in 400 control chromosomes, cosegregated with the affection status, and decreased glucose uptake in functional assays. In the 139 index patients with HSP without paroxysmal dyskinesias, we only identified one sequence variation, which, however, neither decreased glucose uptake nor altered protein expression. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that DYT9 and DYT18 are allelic disorders and enlarges the spectrum of GLUT1 phenotypes, now also including slowly progressive spastic paraparesis combined with PED. SLC2A1 mutations were excluded as a cause of HSP without PED in our cohort.\n",
      "We report on a sister and two brothers born to healthy Iranian parents with mild intellectual disability, progressive muscle weakness, and characteristic facies. including highly arched eyebrows, down-slanting palpebral fissures, prominent nasal bridge, prominent nose, columella extending below alae nasi, narrow mouth, narrow palate, and dental caries, and in one of them an inability to abduct the left eye. Electrophysiological studies showed signs of myopathy, and muscle biopsies demonstrated only nonspecific signs. Brain MRIs in two of the sibs showed leukencephalopathy with delayed myelination, frontal and parietal hyperintensities, and hippocampal atrophy in one. We have been unable to find a description of this association of features in literature. Based on the occurrence in siblings, no significant difference in phenotype between the brothers and sister, absence of manifestations in parents, and a likely consanguinity between parents we performed a homozygosity mapping. A single identical-by-descent bloc encompassing 57 genes located at 3p24.3-p25.3 was found to segregate within the family with this phenotype. √Ç¬© 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\n",
      "We report on a male adult and his son both affected with hitherto undescribed multiple congenital anomalies and mental retardation. Both have peculiar facies, cleft palate, short sature, congenital brevicollis and vertebral abnormalities. Chromosomal analysis is normal and an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance is most likely. Genetic aspects and clinical manifestations are compared with those of previous reports of Robin sequence or cleft palate, short stature and vertebral dysostosis.\n",
      "Three sibs, two girls aged 18 and 9 years, and a 7-year-old boy, were found to have Guadalajara camptodactyly syndrome type I (GCSI). They had intrauterine growth retardation, dwarfism, peculiar facial appearance, camptodactyly and skeletal anomalies. Comparison with other camptodactyly syndromes led to the conclusion that the patients had the same disorder as the two first reported patients with GCSI. The clinical and radiological concordance in the five patients permits further delineation of GCSI and corroboration of its autosomal recessive inheritance.\n",

      "Ivemark Syndrome is a multiple organ syndrome associated with splenic abnormalities, complex cardiac pathology and an abnormality of the abdominal viscera. The incidence in our department is 1/6000 deliveries and the teratogenic effect seems to occur between the 30th and 40th days of intrauterine life, but the cause is unknown. The principal warning signal is bradycardia. Prenatal diagnosis can be made by ultrasound. The prognosis depends on the degree of malformation of the heart.\n",
      "Urocanase is an enzyme in the histidine pathway encoded by the UROC1 gene. This report describes the first putative mutations, p.L70P and p.R450C, in the coding region of the UROC1 gene in a girl with urocanic aciduria presenting with mental retardation and intermittent ataxia. Computed (in silico) predictions, protein expression studies and enzyme activity assays suggest that none of the mutations can produce a fully functional enzyme. The p.L70P substitution, which probably implies the disruption of an alpha-helix in the N-terminus, would alter its properties and therefore, its function. The p.R450C change would render impossible any interaction between urocanase and its substrate and would loss its enzyme activity. Consequently, these studies suggest that both mutations could alter the correct activity of urocanase, which would explain the clinical and biochemical findings described in this patient.\n",
      "The patient was the first child of healthy consanguineous parents. She presented at birth with hypotonia, mild facial dysmorphism, periventricular cysts, marked metabolic acidosis, hyperlactacidemia with normal lactate/pyruvate molar ratios, normoglycemia, and normal ammonia. Hyperlactacidemia was severe (5-14 mmol/l) and not corrected with bicarbonate, thiamine (10 mg/d), 2-chloropropionate (100 mg/kg/d) and a ketogenic diet. Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDHC) activity was normal in lymphocytes and fibroblasts. Functional assays were performed in digitonin-permeabilized fibroblasts to measure oxidation rates from radiolabeled pyruvate and malate. The production of [14C]acetylcarnitine or [14C]citric cycle intermediates derived from [2-14C]pyruvate as well as the release of 14CO(2) from [1-14C]pyruvate was severely impaired, whereas decarboxylation of [U-14C]malate was normal. With increasing concentrations of [1-14C]pyruvate, the patient's fibroblasts behave like control fibroblasts incubated in the presence of alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate, a specific inhibitor of mitochondrial pyruvate uptake: a progressive increase in 14CO(2) production was observed, likely due to passive diffusion of [1-14C]pyruvate through the mitochondrial membranes. Our results are consistent with a defect of mitochondrial pyruvate transport in the patient. Mutational analysis was precluded as the cDNA sequence of the pyruvate carrier has not been identified as yet in any organism. An affected fetus was recognized in a subsequent dichorionic twin pregnancy using the coupled assay measuring [2-14C]pyruvate oxidation rates on digitonin-permeabilized trophoblasts. After selective feticide, the pregnancy was uncomplicated with delivery at 37w of a healthy female, who is currently 2-month old.\n",
      "Three sibs from a Mexican mestizo family affected with a spondylo-epi-metaphyseal dysplasia were studied. The clinical, radiological, and genetic findings were similar to those previously described in Venezuelan Indians of the Irapa tribe. The present patients permit confirmation of the syndrome and provide evidence for autosomal recessive inheritance. Genetic drift is postulated.\n",
      "Langer's mesomelic dysplasia is a rare cause of disproportionate dwarfism. The affected children have a normal intellect and life span and are usually seen later in life for management of skeletal deformities. The diagnosis is usually established on clinical and anthropometric analyses supported with relevant radiological investigations. Plain radiographs and full-length scanograms are sufficient in establishing the diagnosis. Further genetic studies are sometimes performed for confirmation, as Leri Weill dyschondrosteosis and Langer's mesomelic dysplasia are inherited because of mutations in the short stature homeobox (SHOX) gene. The literature is sparse with less than a hundred cases reported, and this case adds to the available data on this rare syndrome.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Dystonia with anarthria and/or aphonia is a rare syndromic association. Here we present two cases with slowly progressive, severe generalized dystonia and aphonia, slow horizontal saccades, epilepsy and photic myoclonus. METHODS: Detailed clinical data were collected over two decades in the female (index) patient and for nine years in her similarly affected son. Sanger sequencing followed by exome sequencing was performed. RESULTS: Both patients had leg onset generalized dystonia with gradual rostral spread including prominent facial and oro-mandibular involvement. The index patient was anarthric, her son aphonic. Both had saccadic slowing, more marked for the horizontal plane, and subclinical epileptic activity. The index patient also had photic myoclonus and a combined axonal and demyelinating neuropathy. Known genetic causes of similar syndromes were not identified. CONCLUSION: These cases with caudo-rostrally spreading generalized dystonia with prominent facial and oro-mandibular involvement, severe speech impairment, marked slowing of horizontal saccades, and photic myoclonus likely represent a novel entity.\n",
      "Transforming growth factor (TGF)-Œ≤1 (encoded by TGFB1) is the prototypic member of the TGF-Œ≤ family of 33 proteins that orchestrate embryogenesis, development and tissue homeostasis1,2. Following its discovery 3 , enormous interest and numerous controversies¬†have emerged about the role of TGF-Œ≤ in coordinating the balance of pro- and anti-oncogenic properties4,5, pro- and anti-inflammatory effects 6 , or pro- and anti-fibrinogenic characteristics 7 . Here we describe three individuals from two pedigrees with biallelic loss-of-function mutations in the TGFB1 gene who presented with severe infantile inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and central nervous system (CNS) disease associated with epilepsy, brain atrophy and posterior leukoencephalopathy. The proteins encoded by the mutated TGFB1 alleles were characterized by impaired secretion, function or stability of the TGF-Œ≤1-LAP complex, which is suggestive of perturbed bioavailability of TGF-Œ≤1. Our study shows that TGF-Œ≤1 has a critical and nonredundant role in the development and homeostasis of intestinal immunity and the CNS in humans.\n",
      "Werner syndrome (WS, MIM#277700) is a very rare autosomal recessive disorder. WS clinical signs include altered distribution of subcutaneous fat, juvenile bilateral cataracts, a mask-like face and bird-like nose, trophic ulcers of the feet, diabetes mellitus, and premature atherosclerosis. The habitus is characteristic, with short stature, stocky trunk and slender extremities. WS frequency has been roughly estimated to be 1: 100,000 in Japan and 1: 1,000,000-1: 10,000,000 outside of Japan. The only exception to the latter data can be seen in the clustering of WS in Sardinia. Since 2001, 5 new cases have been observed: 4 members of the same family and 1 sporadic case. Therefore, since 1982 the total number of cases described in North Sardinia amounts to 18: 15 are familial (11 members of the same family group) and 3 sporadic. A short clinical description of the 5 new cases is reported.\n",
      "Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) are a group of hereditary metabolic diseases characterized by abnormal glycosylation of proteins and lipids. Often, multisystem disorders with central nervous system involvement and a large variety of clinical symptoms occur. The main characteristics are developmental delay, seizures, and ataxia. In this paper we report the clinical and biochemical characteristics of a 5-year-old girl with a defective galactosylation of N-glycans, resulting in developmental delay, muscular hypotonia, epileptic seizures, inverted nipples, and visual impairment. Next generation sequencing revealed a de novo mutation (c.797G‚Äâ>‚ÄâT, p.G266V) in the X-chromosomal gene SLC35A2 (solute carrier family 35, UDP-galactose transporter, member A2; MIM 300896). While this mutation was found heterozygous, random X-inactivation of the normal allele will lead to loss of normal SLC35A2 activity in respective cells. The functional relevance of the mutation was demonstrated by complementation of UGT-deficient MDCK-RCA(r) and CHO-Lec8 cells by normal UGT-expression construct but not by the mutant version. The effect of dietary galactose supplementation on glycosylation was investigated, showing a nearly complete normalization of transferrin glycosylation.\n",
      "Crane-Heise syndrome is a rare lethal and autosomal recessive condition which has been first reported in 1981 in three siblings presenting intrauterine growth retardation, a poorly mineralised calvarium, characteristic facial features comprising cleft lip and palate, hypertelorism, anteverted nares, low-set and posteriorly rotated ears, vertebral anomalies and absent clavicles. Since then, to our knowledge, only one isolated case and two siblings were reported with similar findings. We present two further cases, diagnosed after termination of pregnancy at 24 weeks' gestation in one case and straight after birth in the other, both very similar to the previously reported ones, and broaden the clinical spectrum of this entity. To our knowledge, no molecular mechanism has been identified in Crane-Heise syndrome so far.\n",
      "Microtia is a congenital defect affecting external ears, which appear smaller and sometimes malformed. Here we describe a five-generation family with isolated bilateral microtia segregating as an autosomal dominant trait. Similar features have been previously observed in an autosomal dominant family with non-syndromic microtia and hearing loss segregating with a HOXA2 nonsense variant. HOXA2 biallelic mutations were also described in an inbreed family with autosomal recessive microtia, hearing impairment and incomplete cleft palate. In our family, sequence analysis detected a heterozygous protein truncating nonsense variant [c.670G>T, p.(Glu224*)] segregating in all affected individuals and absent in public databases. This study confirms the role of HOXA2 gene in dominant isolated microtia and contribute to further define the dysmorphogenetic effect of this gene on ear development.\n",
      "We report on 2 sibs, a male and a female, who died shortly after birth from respiratory failure. They combined growth retardation with a Potter-like face, complete phocomelia of the upper limbs, rib anomalies (mainly severe hypoplasia of the 6 upper ribs), renal dysplasia, and external genital abnormalities. We hypothesize that these cases represent evidence for the existence of the \"new syndrome\" described by Ulbright et al. (Am J Med Genet 17:667-668, 1984). This syndrome appears lethal because of the severe renal dysplasia that causes oligohydramnios and pulmonary hypoplasia. Its mode of inheritance seems to be autosomal recessive.\n",
      "Clinical classification of overgrowth syndromes represents a challenge since a wide spectrum of disorders result in marked overgrowth. Therefore, there is a continuous effort to identify the genetic basis of these disorders that will eventually facilitate their molecular classification. Here, we have identified the genetic etiology and the pathogenetic mechanism underlying a rare autosomal recessive overgrowth syndrome in three affected siblings. The overgrowth phenotype in the patients was accompanied by developmental delay, learning disabilities, and variable congenital abnormalities. To elucidate the genetic etiology of the disorder, whole-genome genotyping and whole-exome sequencing were used. The disease was mapped to 3p21.1-p14.2 and 11q13.1-q13.4, where an in-frame insertion (c.175_176insTAA) in FIBP gene was revealed. The resulting indel (p.H59LN) was predicted to change the protein conformation with likely deleterious effect on its function as one of the fibroblast growth factor signaling mediators. In vitro cellular proliferation assay and in situ hypridization in vivo were then performed to understand the pathophysiology of the disease. The patients' skin fibroblasts showed an increased proliferation capacity compared to the controls' explaining the observed overgrowth phenotype. In addition, we detected Fibp expression most notably in the brains of mice embryos suggesting a possible effect on cognitive functions early in development. To date, only one patient has been reported with a homozygous nonsense mutation in FIBP exhibiting an overgrowth syndrome with multiple congenital abnormalities. Taken all together, these findings provide convincing evidence implicating FIBP aberrations in the newly recognized overgrowth syndrome and expand the associated phenotypes to include possible Wilms tumor predisposition. √Ç¬© 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\n",
      "Three siblings of Indian stock had profound bilateral conductive deafness with variable malformations of the external ears, stapedial abnormalities and facial paralysis. Their mother was similarly affected and inheritance of this private syndrome is evidently autosomal dominant. Some improvement of auditory function was obtained by surgical intervention in the middle ear.\n",
      "Tuberculosis continues to be a public health problem in emerging countries with a recent evidence of increased incidence of extrapulmonary localization in developed countries probably linked to HIV. To our knowledge the occurrence of cerebro-mediastinal tuberculosis in an immuno-competent child has not been previously described; moreover the child we describe has a probable Say-Barber-Miller syndrome. We discuss a putative causative link between this syndrome and the occurrence of tuberculosis.A seven-year-old girl presented to our department with a history of infantile encephalopathy since birth characterized by a facial dysmorphy (evocative of a bird face), microcephaly, and mental retardation, and with recurrent infections. The child had complained of back pain for several months; the parents reported anorexia, loss of weight. Spinal and cerebral MRI showed a mediastinal mass involving the spine and cerebral lesions evocative of tuberculomas. The tuberculin interdermal reaction was positive. Culture of a vertebral biopsy was positive for Koch bacillus. Anti-tuberculosis treatment improved general and local status. An extensive immunological work-up was normal.[corrected] This observation is exceptional in many aspects: very early age of onset of extrapulmonary tuberculosis, no immune deficit, association with a rare congenital neurological syndrome. We discuss the possible link between this entity and the occurrence of tuberculosis.\n",
      "Primary aldosteronism is a heterogeneous group of disorders comprising both sporadic and familial forms. Mutations in the KCNJ5 gene, which encodes the inward rectifier K(+) channel 4 (G protein-activated inward rectifier K(+) channel 4, Kir3.4), cause familial hyperaldosteronism type III (FH-III) and are involved in the pathogenesis of sporadic aldosterone-producing adenomas.The objective of the study was to characterize the effects of a newly described KCNJ5 mutation in vitro.The index case is a 62-year-old woman affected by primary aldosteronism, who underwent left adrenalectomy after workup for adrenal adenoma. Exon 1 of KCNJ5 was PCR amplified from adrenal tissue and peripheral blood and sequenced. Electrophysiological and gene expression studies were performed to establish the functional effects of the new mutation on the membrane potential and adrenal cell CYP11B2 expression.KCNJ5 sequencing in the index case revealed a new p.Y152C germline mutation; interestingly, the phenotype of the patient was milder than most of the previously described FH-III families. The tyrosine-to-cysteine substitution resulted in pathological Na(+) permeability, cell membrane depolarization, and disturbed intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis, effects similar, albeit smaller, to the ones demonstrated for other KCNJ5 mutations. Gene expression studies revealed an increased expression of CYP11B2 and its transcriptional regulator NR4A2 in HAC15 adrenal cells overexpressing KCNJ5(Y152C) compared to the wild-type channel. The effect was clearly Ca(2+)-dependent, because it was abolished by the calcium channel blocker nifedipine.Herein we describe a new germline mutation in KCNJ5 responsible for FH-III.\n",
      "Nevi are common skin tumors caused by abnormal overgrowth of cells from the epidermal and dermal layers of the skin. Most nevi are benign, but some pre-cancerous nevi must be monitored or removed. The giant congenital nevus is greater than 10 cm in size, pigmented and often hairy. Between 4% and 6% of these lesions will develop into a malignant melanoma. Since approximately 50% of the melanoma develop by the age of two, and 80% by the age of seven, early removal is recommended. The objective of this paper is to present a unique case of giant nevi and their surgical management.\n",
      "OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to highlight the increasing chance of Western physicians encountering patients (both immigrants and expatriates/travelers) seeking help for loiasis. METHODS: We describe three cases of imported loiasis observed at two hospitals in Italy and France, and present a review of all previously published cases in the medical literature in the last 25 years (1986-2011). The search was performed using PubMed and Scopus databases using the terms \"Loa loa\" AND \"loiasis\". RESULTS: We reviewed 101 cases of imported loiasis of which 61 (60.4%) were reported from Europe and 31 (30.7%) from the USA. Seventy-five percent of infestations were acquired in three countries: Cameroon, Nigeria, and Gabon. Overall, peripheral blood microfilariae were detected in 61.4% of patients, eosinophilia in 82.1%, eye worm migration in 53.5%, and Calabar swellings in 41.6%. However, Calabar swellings and eosinophilia were more common among expatriates/travelers, whereas African immigrants were more likely to have microfilaremia. Eye worm migration was observed in a similar proportion in the two groups. Only 35 patients (including the three described here) underwent clinical follow-up for a median period of 10.5 months (range 1-84 months); clinical relapse occurred in three of these patients and persistence or reappearance of blood microfilaria in another two. CONCLUSIONS: Due to increasing travel and the migration of people from the endemic countries of West Africa to Europe and the USA, we speculate on the possible emergence of loiasis. Western physicians should be aware of the typical (eye worm migration and Calabar swellings) as well as unusual clinical presentations.\n",
      "We report three siblings who were variably affected by craniosynostosis, calcification of the basal ganglia, and mild facial dysmorphism comprising prominent eyes and a prominent nasal bridge. The children are of normal intelligence and have no limb abnormalities. Their parents are first cousins and are phenotypically normal. We propose that this combination of clinical findings represents a recognizable, autosomal recessive craniosynostosis syndrome.\n",
      "Congenital absence of pain perception is a rare phenotype. Here we report two unrelated adult individuals who have a previously unreported neuropathy consisting of congenital absence of pain with hyperhidrosis (CAPH). Both subjects had normal intelligence and productive lives despite failure to experience pain due to broken bones, severe cold or burns. Functional assessments revealed that both are generally hypesthetic with thresholds greater than two standard deviations above normal for a several of modalities in addition to noxious stimuli. Sweating was 3 to 8-fold greater than normal. Sural nerve biopsy showed that all types of myelinated and unmyelinated fibers were severely reduced. Extensive multi-antibody immunofluorescence analyses were conducted on several skin biopsies from the hands and back of one CAPH subject and two normal subjects. The CAPH subject had all normal types of immunochemically and morphologically distinct sensory and autonomic innervation to the vasculature and sweat glands, including a previously unknown cholinergic arterial innervation. Virtually all other types of normal cutaneous C, Adelta and Abeta-fiber endings were absent. This subject had no mutations in the genes SCN9A, SCN10A, SCN11A, NGFB, TRKA, NRTN and GFRA2. Our findings suggest three hypotheses: (1) that development or maintenance of sensory innervation to cutaneous vasculature and sweat glands may be under separate genetic control from that of all other cutaneous sensory innervation, (2) the latter innervation is preferentially vulnerable to some environmental factor, and (3) vascular and sweat gland afferents may contribute to conscious cutaneous perception.\n",
      "In this report, we describe two siblings with short stature and severe lateral tibial bowing. In the younger sibling, the bowing was bilateral, while in the older sib, it was unilateral. However, both showed bilateral abnormalities of the distal tibial epiphyses and growth plates. Pseudoarthrosis of the left distal tibial metaphysis and subsequent spontaneous resolution of the abnormality occurred in the younger sibling. The fibulas of both children were of normal diameter and were straight, except for the distal ends. Surgery has almost completely corrected the lower leg bowing in both patients. The type of tibial bowing seen in these children can be associated with a number of syndromes, such as neurofibromatosis type I, Weismann-Netter syndrome, and a variety of environmental caused disorders, such as vitamin D deficient rickets. However, the severity of the bowing present in our patients and the absence of other clinical features differentiates this condition from those reported in the literature. We posit that the condition in the children presented here represents an as yet undescribed syndrome, which is likely to be of genetic origin.\n",
      "A new syndrome in two siblings with primordial birdheaded nanism, progressive ataxia, goiter, primary gonadal insufficiency and insulin resistant diabetes mellitus is presented. Plasma concentrations of TSH, PTH, LH, FSH, ACTH, glucagon and insulin all working through cell membrane receptors were elevated. A generalized cell membrane defect was suggested to be the pathophysiological abnormality in these patients.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: To present prenatal diagnosis and molecular genetic analyses of mosaic trisomy 7. MATERIALS, METHODS AND RESULTS: A 38-year-old primigravid woman underwent amniocentesis at 19 weeks of gestation because of her advanced maternal age. Amniocentesis revealed a karyotype of 47,XY,+7[26]/46, XY[16]. Repeated amniocentesis at 21 weeks of gestation revealed a karyotype of 47,XY,+7[20]/46,XY[17]. Simultaneous cordocentesis revealed a karyotype of 46,XY in 100/100 cultured lymphocytes. Polymorphic DNA marker analyses of uncultured amniocytes and cord blood revealed a diallelic pattern with seemingly equal biparental inheritance of chromosome 7. Repeated cordocentesis and chorionic villus sampling at 23 weeks of gestation revealed a karyotype of 47,XY,+7[2]/46,XY[66] in cord blood and a karyotype of 47,XY,+7 in 24/24 cultured chorionic villi cells. Level II ultrasonography was normal. At 40 weeks of gestation, a 2,708 g normal male baby was delivered. The peripheral blood had a karyotype of 46,XY in 100/100 lymphocytes. Molecular analyses of placenta, urine, buccal swab, and peripheral blood revealed a diallelic pattern and seemingly equal biparental inheritance of chromosome 7 in all tissues. At 3 months of age, he manifested hypopigmented skin and inguinal hernia, but showed normal growth and mental development. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of inguinal hernia sac tissue revealed that 19/100 (19%) of nuclei had three chromosome 7 signals. CONCLUSION: Mosaic trisomy 7 at amniocentesis may be derived from a cell culture artifact from an undetected low level of trisomy 7 mosaicism in uncultured amniocytes, and can be associated with favorable fetal outcome if the blood has a normal karyotype or a very low level of mosaicism and if uniparental disomy for chromosome 7 is excluded.\n",
      "We report on a boy with a rare malformative association of scrotum agenesis, ophthalmological anomalies, cerebellar malformation, facial dysmorphism and global development delay. The reported patient was carrying a homozygous frameshift in MAB21L1 detected by whole-exome sequencing, considered as the most likely disease-causing variant. Mab21l1 knockout mice present a strikingly similar malformative association of ophthalmological malformations of the anterior chamber and preputial glands hypoplasia. We hypothesize that MAB21L1 haploinsufficiency cause a previously undescribed syndrome with scrotal agenesis, ophthalmological anomalies, facial dysmorphism and gross psychomotor delay as remarkable hallmarks. Four cases from the literature were reported with features suggestive of a similar and recognizable clinical entity. We hypothesize that MAB21L1 should be the culprit gene in these patients.\n",
      "Two males, 9-11 and 29-31 years of age, with severe hypoplasia of the nose, hypoplasia of the eyes, sensory abnormalities of taste and smell, and hypogonadism were studied. The nasal septum, cribriform plates and foramina of the vomeronasal (vn) nerves were demonstrated in both; the capsule of the vn organ was shown in one. Their nasal skeleton, demonstrated by tomoradiography, had grown in early embryological form. The nose was not patent in either patient. In both, the cranial vaults, orbits, epipharynges, and oral cavities were indented toward the hypoplastic nasal composite and the peripheral dimensions of their faces were normal for their respective ages. Each patient had impaired visual function with cataracts and colobomata. Each was unable to recognize the smell of any vapor (Type I hyposmia), and had severe impairment of recognition of any tastant (recognition hypogeusia); detection of vapors and of tastants were in appropriate anatomical areas. Each was unable orally to recognize standard plastic forms (astereognosis) though each could recognize the forms manually. Each patient had bilateral inguinal hernias, one or two undescended testes, and hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism. These patients do not fall within the spectrum of arrhinencephaly because of the presence of medial structure of attachment of the falx cerebri and because of their normal intelligence. Distinction of patients with this pattern of abnormalities from arrhinencephaly is important by reason of their potentiality of normal mental development. We hypothesize that their abnormalities resulted from an embryological disruption that occurred in the first trimester of pregnancy. The embryogenesis of the nasal composite is presumed to have been adequate for reciprocal induction of the anlagen of the forebrain. Development of their faces to normal peripheral dimensions indicates that the nasal composite is not essential for gross facial enlargement.\n",
      "This is the first report of familial idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis associated with hepatic nodular regenerative hyperplasia and bone marrow hypoplasia. Four members of one family presented with this triad of organ dysfunction. The response to immunosuppressive treatment was poor and all four members succumbed to the disease processes. The current literature is reviewed and mechanisms that could have been involved in the development of this new syndrome are proposed.\n",
      "In 1954, Weismann-Netter and Stuhl described three sporadic adults and a mother and her three children with short stature and congenital anterior bowing of lower legs [Weismann-Netter and Stuhl (1954); Presse M√©d 62:1618-1622]. They named the condition \"toxopachyost√©ose diaphysaire tibio-p√©roni√®re,\" which presently is known as Weismann-Netter syndrome (WNS) (OMIM 112350). Since then more than 100 patients have been published. Nearly all have been case reports in French medical literature, and the first report in the Anglo-American literature appeared in 1988. Only a minority of the publications have appeared during the past two decades. The diagnostic findings of WNS are anterior bowing of the diaphyses of tibia and fibula, broadening or \"tibialization\" of the fibula and posterior cortical thickening of the two bones. Also the diaphyses of other long bones may be similarly affected but usually to a milder degree. The cause of the condition is unknown, but frequent familial cases suggest a genetic defect with autosomal dominant inheritance. Several of the WNS patients have also had mental retardation (MR), but the existence of a WNS-MR syndrome is still pending. We describe a sporadic patient with typical WNS skeletal findings and MR. He also had postnatal growth deceleration with partially corrective pubertal growth, normal head size and normal brain structures on MRI. We review the WNS literature.\n",
      "Germline mutations in five autosomal genes involved in interleukin (IL)-12-dependent, interferon (IFN)-gamma-mediated immunity cause Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial diseases (MSMD). The molecular basis of X-linked recessive (XR)-MSMD remains unknown. We report here mutations in the leucine zipper (LZ) domain of the NF-kappaB essential modulator (NEMO) gene in three unrelated kindreds with XR-MSMD. The mutant proteins were produced in normal amounts in blood and fibroblastic cells. However, the patients' monocytes presented an intrinsic defect in T cell-dependent IL-12 production, resulting in defective IFN-gamma secretion by T cells. IL-12 production was also impaired as the result of a specific defect in NEMO- and NF-kappaB/c-Rel-mediated CD40 signaling after the stimulation of monocytes and dendritic cells by CD40L-expressing T cells and fibroblasts, respectively. However, the CD40-dependent up-regulation of costimulatory molecules of dendritic cells and the proliferation and immunoglobulin class switch of B cells were normal. Moreover, the patients' blood and fibroblastic cells responded to other NF-kappaB activators, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-1beta, and lipopolysaccharide. These two mutations in the NEMO LZ domain provide the first genetic etiology of XR-MSMD. They also demonstrate the importance of the T cell- and CD40L-triggered, CD40-, and NEMO/NF-kappaB/c-Rel-mediated induction of IL-12 by monocyte-derived cells for protective immunity to mycobacteria in humans.\n",
      "Autosomal dominant dehydrated hereditary stomatocytosis (DHSt) usually presents as a compensated hemolytic anemia with macrocytosis and abnormally shaped red blood cells (RBCs). DHSt is part of a pleiotropic syndrome that may also exhibit pseudohyperkalemia and perinatal edema. We identified PIEZO1 as the disease gene for pleiotropic DHSt in a large kindred by exome sequencing analysis within the previously mapped 16q23-q24 interval. In 26 affected individuals among 7 multigenerational DHSt families with the pleiotropic syndrome, 11 heterozygous PIEZO1 missense mutations cosegregated with disease. PIEZO1 is expressed in the plasma membranes of RBCs and its messenger RNA, and protein levels increase during in vitro erythroid differentiation of CD34(+) cells. PIEZO1 is also expressed in liver and bone marrow during human and mouse development. We suggest for the first time a correlation between a PIEZO1 mutation and perinatal edema. DHSt patient red cells with the R2456H mutation exhibit increased ion-channel activity. Functional studies of PIEZO1 mutant R2488Q expressed in Xenopus oocytes demonstrated changes in ion-channel activity consistent with the altered cation content of DHSt patient red cells. Our findings provide direct evidence that R2456H and R2488Q mutations in PIEZO1 alter mechanosensitive channel regulation, leading to increased cation transport in erythroid cells.\n",
      "Isolated dystonia is a disorder characterized by involuntary twisting postures arising from sustained muscle contractions. Although autosomal-dominant mutations in TOR1A, THAP1, and GNAL have been found in some cases, the molecular mechanisms underlying isolated dystonia are largely unknown. In addition, although emphasis has been placed on dominant isolated dystonia, the disorder is also transmitted as a recessive trait, for which no mutations have been defined. Using whole-exome sequencing in a recessive isolated dystonia-affected kindred, we identified disease-segregating compound heterozygous mutations in COL6A3, a collagen VI gene associated previously with muscular dystrophy. Genetic screening of a further 367 isolated dystonia subjects revealed two additional recessive pedigrees harboring compound heterozygous mutations in COL6A3. Strikingly, all affected individuals had at least one pathogenic allele in exon 41, including an exon-skipping mutation that induced an in-frame deletion. We tested the hypothesis that disruption of this exon is pathognomonic for isolated dystonia by inducing a series of in-frame deletions in zebrafish embryos. Consistent with our human genetics data, suppression of the exon 41 ortholog caused deficits in axonal outgrowth, whereas suppression of other exons phenocopied collagen deposition mutants. All recessive mutation carriers demonstrated early-onset segmental isolated dystonia without muscular disease. Finally, we show that Col6a3 is expressed in neurons, with relevant mRNA levels detectable throughout the adult mouse brain. Taken together, our data indicate that loss-of-function mutations affecting a specific region of COL6A3 cause recessive isolated dystonia with underlying neurodevelopmental deficits and highlight the brain extracellular matrix as a contributor to dystonia pathogenesis.\n",
      "We report on 2 sisters with Karsch-Neugebauer syndrome comprising split foot and split hand anomalies in association with congenital nystagmus. These sisters share a nearly identical phenotype with the 8 previously reported instances of this disorder. Although genetic heterogeneity can not be formally excluded, most evidence suggests that Karsch-Neugebauer syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder. If so, then this report of 2 affected sibs born to healthy parents is the second instance of apparent gonadal mosaicism in this disorder. The apparent high frequency of gonadal mosaicism is important to recognize in counseling families with this disorder.\n",

      "Microtubule dynamics play a crucial role in neuronal development and function, and several neurodevelopmental disorders have been linked to mutations in genes encoding tubulins and functionally related proteins. Most recently, variants in the tubulin cofactor D (TBCD) gene, which encodes one of the five co-chaperones required for assembly and disassembly of Œ±/Œ≤-tubulin heterodimer, were reported to underlie a recessive neurodevelopmental/neurodegenerative disorder. We report on five patients from three unrelated families, who presented with microcephaly, intellectual disability, intractable seizures, optic nerve pallor/atrophy, and cortical atrophy with delayed myelination and thinned corpus callosum on brain imaging. Exome sequencing allowed the identification of biallelic variants in TBCD segregating with the disease in the three families. TBCD protein level was significantly reduced in cultured fibroblasts from one patient, supporting defective TBCD function as the event underlying the disorder. Such reduced expression was associated with accelerated microtubule re-polymerization. Morpholino-mediated TBCD knockdown in zebrafish recapitulated several key pathological features of the human disease, and TBCD overexpression in the same model confirmed previous studies documenting an obligate dependency on proper TBCD levels during development. Our findings confirm the link between inactivating TBCD variants and this newly described chaperone-associated tubulinopathy, and provide insights into the phenotype of this disorder.\n",
      "First cousins, a male and a female, with a new type of hidrotic ectodermal dysplasia are described. They were each the result of first cousin marriage from the Egyptian Karaite community. They both had partial adontia, conical peg-shaped teeth, fine hair that did not grow long, normal sweating, eversion of lips, and pronounced facial similarity. The male had cleft lip on the right side while the female had a branchial cyst on the left side of the neck. The parents of both the cases were completely normal. The patients had distinct clinical similarity to the condition described by Witkop (1965) as 'Autosomal dominant dysplasia of nails and hypodontia' but the nails were less affected and the mode of inheritance was completely different.\n",
      "In this study, we describe a novel thrombomodulin (TM) mutation (c.1611C>A) that codes for a change from cysteine 537 to a premature stop codon (p.Cys537Stop). Three members of a family with a history of posttraumatic bleeding were identified to be heterozygous for this TM mutation. All coagulation screening tests, coagulation factor assays, and platelet function test results were within normal limits. However, the endogenous thrombin potential was markedly reduced at low-tissue factor concentration, and failure to correct with normal plasma indicated the presence of a coagulation inhibitor. Plasma TM levels were highly elevated (433-845 ng/ml, normal range 2-8 ng/ml, equating to 5 to 10 nM), and the addition of exogenous protein C further decreased thrombin generation. The mutation, p.Cys537Stop, results in a truncation within the carboxyl-terminal transmembrane helix. We predict that as a consequence of the truncation, the variant TM is shed from the endothelial surface into the blood plasma. This would promote systemic protein C activation and early cessation of thrombin generation within a developing hemostatic clot, thereby explaining the phenotype of posttraumatic bleeding observed within this family.\n",
      "We report the seventh case of autosomal recessive inherited mitochondrial myopathy, lactic acidosis, and sideroblastic anemia The patient, a product of consanguineous Persian Jews, had the association of mental retardation, dysmorphic features, lactic acidosis, myopathy, and sideroblastic anemia. Muscle biopsy demonstrated low activity of complexes 1 and 4 of the respiratory chain. Electron microscopy revealed paracrystalline inclusions in most mitochondria. Southern blot of the mitochondrial DNA did not show any large-scale rearrangements. The patient was found to be homozygous for the 656C-->T mutation in the pseudouridine synthase 1 gene (PUS1). Mitochondrial myopathy, lactic acidosis, and sideroblastic anemia is an oxidative phosphorylation disorder causing sideroblastic anemia, myopathy, and, in some cases, mental retardation that is due to mutations in the nuclear-encoded PUS1 gene. This finding provides additional evidence that mitochondrial ribonucleic acid modification impacts the phenotypic expression of oxidative phosphorylation disorders.\n",
      "Congenital pancreatic cysts are extremely rare in newborns. The case of a neonatal congenital pancreatic cyst with pancreatitis is reported. The rapid increase in cyst size concomitantly with clinical symptoms prompted surgical management. Intraoperatively, the pancreatic head showed signs of chronic pancreatitis, and in attempts to preserve most of the functional pancreatic tissue, a Roux-en-Y cystojejunostomy was performed. Histology demonstrated a true pancreatic cyst with degenerated epithelial lining.\n",

      "Brachyolmia refers to a form of skeletal dysplasia characterized by general platyspondyly without significant epiphyseal, metaphyseal, or diaphyseal changes in the long bones. As a result of a study of 11 patients from 7 different families and a review of the literature we propose that there are 3 and possibly 4 different types of brachyolmia: 1. Hobaek type--an autosomal recessive condition with universal platyspondyly, irregular, and reduced intervertebral spaces and marked extension of the lateral margins of the vertebrae. Rectangular and elongated vertebral bodies are seen on lateral views of the spine, which become more pronounced with age. Toledo type--radiographically similar to Hobaek type but also associated with corneal opacities and precocious ossification of costal cartilage. It is uncertain as to whether this represents variability or heterogeneity. 2. Maroteaux type--an autosomal recessive disorder that is distinguished from Hobaek type by rounding of the anterior and posterior vertebral borders with less elongation on lateral view and less lateral extension on A.P. view. This type may be associated with precocious calcification of the falx cerebri, and minor facial anomalies. 3. Dominant type--a previously underscribed form which we have observed in a mother and her son. This type has the most severe vertebral changes with flattening and irregularities of the cervical spine. These clinical, radiological, and genetic differences suggest genetic heterogeneity in this group of platyspondylic disorders.\n",
      "We performed genome-wide homozygosity mapping and mapped a novel myopathic phenotype to chromosomal region 1q25 in a consanguineous family with three affected individuals manifesting proximal and distal weakness and atrophy, rigid spine and contractures of the proximal and distal interphalangeal hand joints. Additionally, cardiomyopathy and respiratory involvement were noted. DNA sequencing of torsinA-interacting protein 1 (TOR1AIP1) gene encoding lamina-associated polypeptide 1B (LAP1B), showed a homozygous c.186delG mutation that causes a frameshift resulting in a premature stop codon (p.E62fsTer25). We observed that expression of LAP1B was absent in the patient skeletal muscle fibres. Ultrastructural examination showed intact sarcomeric organization but alterations of the nuclear envelope including nuclear fragmentation, chromatin bleb formation and naked chromatin. LAP1B is a type-2 integral membrane protein localized in the inner nuclear membrane that binds to both A- and B-type lamins, and is involved in the regulation of torsinA ATPase. Interestingly, luminal domain-like LAP1 (LULL1)-an endoplasmic reticulum-localized partner of torsinA-was overexpressed in the patient's muscle in the absence of LAP1B. Therefore, the findings suggest that LAP1 and LULL1 might have a compensatory effect on each other. This study expands the spectrum of genes associated with nuclear envelopathies and highlights the critical function for LAP1B in striated muscle.\n",
      "Autosomal dominant inheritance of a syndrome comprising palmoplantar keratoderma, nail dystrophy, and hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy (HMSN) was observed in three generations of one family. Nail dystrophy affected the toe and fingernails; it was present at birth or developed during early childhood. Palmoplantar keratoderma became apparent in later childhood. Each subject with nail dystrophy and keratoderma also had clinical or electrophysiological evidence of axonal neuropathy.\n",
      "A brother and sister, children of normal parents are described. They had retinitis pigmentosa, causing near-blindness as a result of very narrow fields of vision, associated with metaphyseal chondrodysplasia and marked shortening of the metacarpals and terminal phalanges. Autosomal recessive inheritance is suggested with a common biochemical cause for all these defects. This apparently new association of retinitis pigmentosa with a systemic bone dysplasia emphasises that this not uncommon clinical diagnosis has a variety of different possible causes.\n",
      "Trichodental syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant ectodermal dysplasia. Hair and dental anomalies have been found in different combinations in most affected persons in three families. The features of trichodental syndrome were observed in a young female in which sparse, fine, lustreless and slow growing hairs were associated with bigeminismus of inferior lateral incisors. Ultrastructural hair analysis showed consistent variation in contour of the shaft and reduced to absent cuticular scale. Distinguishing features in this patient were microcephaly and mild mental retardation.\n",
      "Chromosomal deletions encompassing DYRK1A have been associated with intellectual disability for several years. More recently, point mutations in DYRK1A have been shown to be responsible for a recognizable syndrome characterized by microcephaly, developmental delay and intellectual disability (ID) as well as characteristic facial features. Here we present 2 individuals with novel mutations in DYRK1A, and a review of the cases reported to date.Both individuals presented with the well-known characteristic features, as well as rarer anomalies seen in a minority of patients. Patient 1 presented shortly after birth with an enlarged cisterna magna, distal contractures, and distinctive facies that included bitemporal narrowing and deep set eyes. A de novo splice site mutation in DYRK1A [c.951 + 4_951 + 7delAGTA; p.Val222Aspfs*22] was identified by next generation sequencing. Patient 2 presented at 7 months of age with microcephaly and dysmorphic features. She went several years without a diagnosis until a de novo DYRK1A nonsense mutation [c.787C>T; p.(Arg263*)] was identified at age 12. These individuals, and the 52 cases reviewed from the literature, show the characteristic features of the DYRK1A-related syndrome including global developmental delay, ID, microcephaly, feeding difficulties, and the facial gestalt. Other common findings include seizures, vision defects, brain abnormalities and skeletal abnormalities of the hands and feet. Less common features include optic nerve defects, contractures, ataxia, and cardiac anomalies.DYRK1A testing should be considered in individuals with the facial features, intellectual disability and post-natal microcephaly. Once diagnosed with DYRK1A-related intellectual disability, a cardiac and ophthalmologic assessment would be recommended as would routine surveillance by a pediatrician for psychomotor development, growth, and feeding.\n",
      "A family had an unusual and perhaps unique familial dysrhythmia. The proband had a short PR interval with normal QRS and chronic recurrent paroxysmal atrial tachycardia (Lown-Ganong-Levine syndrome). The arrhythmia produced left ventricular dysfunction. Both paroxysmal atrial tachycardia (PAT) and left ventricular dysfunction were reversed with administration of digoxin and propranolol hydrochloride. Three family members had paroxysmal or chronic atrial fibrillation, first diagnosed at a relatively young age (23 years, 38 years, and early 40s, respectively). Five additional family members had short PR intervals with normal QRS, and eight other family members had borderline short PR intervals. The mode of inheritance appeared to be autosomal dominant with varying expressivity. We have described a familial syndrome characterized by PAT or atrial fibrillation in its advanced form with short PR interval as a possible identifying trait. The future course of members with isolated short PR is unknown.\n",
      "Three deceased infants from a Pakistani consanguineous family presented with a similar phenotype of cholestatic liver disease, hypotonia, severe failure to thrive, recurrent vomiting, renal tubulopathy, and a progressive neurodegenerative course. Mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome was considered in view of multisystem involvement. Exome sequencing, revealed a homozygous novel mutation c.1183T>C (p.F395L) in exon 1 of the C10orf2 TWINKLE gene. The hepatocerebral phenotype is well recognized in association with recessive mutations involving the C10orf2 TWINKLE gene. The feature of renal tubulopathy adds to the multisystemic presentation in our patients and further demonstrates an expansion of the phenotype in mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome associated with TWINKLE gene mutations. The absence of features of an epileptic encephalopathy appears to be of added interest.\n",
      "Metatropic dysplasia is a rare but severe spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia characterized by long trunk and short extremities. The exact incidence is not known; however, 81 cases have been reported in the literature till now. Due to progressive kyphoscoliosis, there is a reversal of proportions in childhood (shortening of trunk with relative long extremities). The diagnostic radiographic findings include marked platyspondyly (wafer-thin vertebral bodies), widened metaphyses (dumbbell-shaped tubular bones) and small epiphysis and a specific pelvic shape. The severe kyphoscoliosis is relentless and resistant to conservative treatment with bracing. Operative treatment is controversial due to the recurrence of deformity despite aggressive correction. We, herein report a case of this rare dysplasia and its follow-up after corrective surgery for spine and limb deformity. The excellent correction and good functional pulmonary status at 6-year follow-up has never been previously reported.\n",
      "We report the familial occurrence in a French Canadian family of peptic ulcer/hiatal hernia, multiple lentigines/caf√©-au-lait spots, apparent hypertelorism, and myopia caused by a pleiotropic autosomal dominant gene with high penetrance and variable expressivity. Other probable but rarer components of the syndrome include ischemic heart disease, congenital heart disease, and maturity onset diabetes. Symptoms of peptic ulcer/hiatal hernia usually started in the second or third decade and were associated, as least in some examined individuals, with relatively increased acid secretion and abnormal dermatoglyphics.\n",
      "Cutaneous collagenous vasculopathy is a very rare entity first described in 2000, manifesting clinically with acquired, progressively diffuse, cutaneous telangiectases with a histologically distinct aspect, characterized by a thick hyaline collagenous wall. Its cause is unknown. Differential diagnosis includes mainly generalized essential telangiectasia and telangiectatic mastocytosis. We report a 65-year-old Caucasian patient who presented with progressive telangiectasia starting over the lower limbs that spread progressively upwards. Histopathologic (light and electron microscopic) examinations were typical of cutaneous collagenous vasculopathy. We review the salient clinicopathologic features of this poorly known condition.\n",
      "We report on a mother and son with an inherited skeletal disorder of rhizomelic short stature and lateral clavicular defects. This entity has apparently not been reported previously and represents a newly recognized autosomal dominant skeletal dysplasia.\n",
      "A family is described in which the father and three of his seven children have microcephaly, mild to moderate mental retardation, and sparse hair. The two affected boys have generalised seizures in addition.\n",

      "Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) comprises clinically heterogeneous connective tissue disorders with diverse molecular etiologies. The 2017 International Classification for EDS recognized 13 distinct subtypes caused by pathogenic variants in 19 genes mainly encoding fibrillar collagens and collagen-modifying or processing proteins. Recently, a new EDS subtype, i.e., classical-like EDS type 2, was defined after the identification, in six patients with clinical findings reminiscent of EDS, of recessive alterations in AEBP1, which encodes the aortic carboxypeptidase‚Åªlike protein associating with collagens in the extracellular matrix. Herein, we report on a 53-year-old patient, born from healthy second-cousins, who fitted the diagnostic criteria for classical EDS (cEDS) for the presence of hyperextensible skin with multiple atrophic scars, generalized joint hypermobility, and other minor criteria. Molecular analyses of cEDS genes did not identify any causal variant. Therefore, AEBP1 sequencing was performed that revealed homozygosity for the rare c.1925T>C p.(Leu642Pro) variant classified as likely pathogenetic (class 4) according to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines. The comparison of the patient's features with those of the other patients reported up to now and the identification of the first missense variant likely associated with the condition offer future perspectives for EDS nosology and research in this field.\n",
      "Four males, the sons of 2 sisters, apparently have a new syndrome of mental retardation, seizures and psoriasis. Due to the relationship between the affected males we propose the inheritance to be X-linked recessive although cosegregation of two separate disorders may be occurring. Psoriasis has never been reported as a monogenic disorder. Results of cytogenetic studies, including fra (X) and high-resolution prometaphase analysis, were negative. Steroid sulfatase activities of cultured fibroblasts from 2 surviving affected males were normal. The results of HLA typing of all available relatives did not indicate a strong association between the skin disorder and certain HLA antigens. A healthy sister, who may be heterozygous carrier of the mutant X chromosome, decided on termination of 3 successive pregnancies after prenatal male sex determinations. Her fourth pregnancy with a female fetus is ongoing.\n",
      "We have studied a boy with a particular clinical picture of mental retardation, hypotrichosis, early eruption of teeth, and syndactyly of hands. One sister, who died at four month of age, probably was also affected. This clinical association may represent an undescribed condition. Autosomal recessive inheritance is suggested.\n",
      "Two brothers had progressive spastic paraplegia and precocious puberty develop due to Leydig's cell hyperplasia when they were 2 years old. Both later had moderate mental retardation. Family members displayed brisk lower-extremity reflexes and dysarthria in a pedigree that suggested autosomal dominant inheritance with variable expression. Precocious puberty has been associated with other neurologic syndromes. Its occurrence in two brothers with spastic paraplegia has not, to our knowledge, been previously reported.\n",
      "Upon detection of pathogen-associated molecular patterns, innate immune receptors initiate inflammatory responses. These receptors include cytoplasmic NOD-like receptors (NLRs) whose stimulation recruits and proteolytically activates caspase-1 within the inflammasome, a multiprotein complex. Caspase-1 mediates the production of interleukin-1 family cytokines (IL1FCs), leading to fever and inflammatory cell death (pyroptosis). Mutations that constitutively activate these pathways underlie several autoinflammatory diseases with diverse clinical features. We describe a family with a previously unreported syndrome featuring neonatal-onset enterocolitis, periodic fever, and fatal or near-fatal episodes of autoinflammation. We show that the disease is caused by a de novo gain-of-function mutation in NLRC4 encoding a p.Val341Ala substitution in the HD1 domain of the protein that cosegregates with disease. Mutant NLRC4 causes constitutive IL1FC production and macrophage cell death. Infected macrophages from affected individuals are polarized toward pyroptosis and exhibit abnormal staining for inflammasome components. These findings identify and describe the cause of a life-threatening but treatable autoinflammatory disease that underscores the divergent roles of the NLRC4 inflammasome.\n",
      "Lowry-Wood syndrome (LWS) is a rare condition characterized by multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (MED), microcephaly, and congenital nystagmus. A variable degree of mental retardation can also be present. It is probably inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. We report a new case of MED and microcephaly, without other additional features, suggesting a mild form of LWS. Molecular analysis of the cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) gene was performed and failed to find mutations.\n",
      "An apparently new X-linked syndrome is presented. It occurred in four male first cousins. The main manifestations of this syndrome are severe mental retardation, bilateral congenital hip luxation, and short stature. Three of the affected males showed a new glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase variant.\n",
      "Familial cutaneous collagenoma is a rare hereditary disease that is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. It is characterized by early onset of multiple, skin-colored, sometimes hypopigmented cutaneous nodules, which initially show a symmetrical arrangement on the trunk, and later on the neck and upper limbs. We report on a case of a 45-year-old female who presented with multiple oval to round hypopigmented papules measuring 5~15 mm on her trunk. Histopathologically, the lesions showed an increased amount of collagen fibers and decreased, fragmented elastic fibers in the dermis. The skin lesions were diagnosed as familial cutaneous collagenoma and no treatment was administered. To the best of our knowledge, our case is the first reported case of familial cutaneous collagenoma (FCC) in the Korean literature.\n",
      "Mutation specific effects in monogenic disorders are rare. We describe atypical Fanconi syndrome caused by a specific heterozygous mutation in HNF4A. Heterozygous HNF4A mutations cause a beta cell phenotype of neonatal hyperinsulinism with macrosomia and young onset diabetes. Autosomal dominant idiopathic Fanconi syndrome (a renal proximal tubulopathy) is described but no genetic cause has been defined.We report six patients heterozygous for the p.R76W HNF4A mutation who have Fanconi syndrome and nephrocalcinosis in addition to neonatal hyperinsulinism and macrosomia. All six displayed a novel phenotype of proximal tubulopathy, characterised by generalised aminoaciduria, low molecular weight proteinuria, glycosuria, hyperphosphaturia and hypouricaemia, and additional features not seen in Fanconi syndrome: nephrocalcinosis, renal impairment, hypercalciuria with relative hypocalcaemia, and hypermagnesaemia. This was mutation specific, with the renal phenotype not being seen in patients with other HNF4A mutations. In silico modelling shows the R76 residue is directly involved in DNA binding and the R76W mutation reduces DNA binding affinity. The target(s) selectively affected by altered DNA binding of R76W that results in Fanconi syndrome is not known.The HNF4A R76W mutation is an unusual example of a mutation specific phenotype, with autosomal dominant atypical Fanconi syndrome in addition to the established beta cell phenotype.\n",
      "Blomstrand osteochondrodysplasia (BOCD) is a rare autosomal recessive sclerosing skeletal dysplasia characterized by accelerated chondrocyte differentiation. In this article, we discuss three cases where lethal skeletal dysplasia was suspected and Blomstrand dysplasia was diagnosed by autopsy. Antenatal ultrasound findings include increased nuchal translucency, tetramicromelia and polyhydramnios. Radiological hallmark is advanced skeletal maturation and bone sclerosis. Histology of long bones revealed narrow cartilagenous cap and changes in the physeal growth zone which showed severe hypoplasia and disorganization of proliferative phase and hypertrophic phase. Homozygous and compound heterozygous mutations in PTHR1 gene have been implicated in the pathogenesis of this chondrodysplasia.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the utility of autozygome analysis and exome sequencing in a cohort of patients with suspected or confirmed mitochondrial encephalomyopathy. METHODS: Autozygome was used to highlight candidate genes for direct sequencing in 10 probands, all born to consanguineous parents. Autozygome was also used to filter the variants from exome sequencing of four probands. RESULTS: In addition to revealing mutations in known mitochondrial genes, the analysis revealed the identification of two novel candidate disease genes: MFF and FARS2, encoding the mitochondrial fission factor and phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase, respectively. INTERPRETATION: These findings expand the repertoire of genes that are mutated in patients with mitochondrial disorders and highlight the value of integrating genomic approaches in the evaluation of these patients.\n",
      "Export of mRNA from the cell nucleus to the cytoplasm is essential for protein synthesis, a process vital to all living eukaryotic cells. mRNA export is highly conserved and ubiquitous. Mutations affecting mRNA and mRNA processing or export factors, which cause aberrant retention of mRNAs in the nucleus, are thus emerging as contributors to an important class of human genetic disorders. Here, we report that variants in THOC2, which encodes a subunit of the highly conserved TREX mRNA-export complex, cause syndromic intellectual disability (ID). Affected individuals presented with variable degrees of ID and commonly observed features included speech delay, elevated BMI, short stature, seizure disorders, gait disturbance, and tremors. X chromosome exome sequencing revealed four missense variants in THOC2 in four families, including family MRX12, first ascertained in 1971. We show that two variants lead to decreased stability of THOC2 and its TREX-complex partners in cells derived from the affected individuals. Protein structural modeling showed that the altered amino acids are located in the RNA-binding domains of two complex THOC2 structures, potentially representing two different intermediate RNA-binding states of THOC2 during RNA transport. Our results show that disturbance of the canonical molecular pathway of mRNA export is compatible with life but results in altered neuronal development with other comorbidities.\n",
      "C√¥t√© et al. [1981] suggested that ring chromosomes with or without deletions share a common pattern of phenotypic anomalies, regardless of which chromosome is involved. The phenotype of this 'general ring syndrome' consists of growth failure without malformations, few or no minor anomalies, and mild to moderate mental retardation. We reconsidered the ring chromosome 2 case previously published by C√¥t√© et al. [1981], and we characterized it by array CGH, polymorphic markers as well as subtelomere MLPA and FISH analysis. A terminal deletion (q37.3qter) of maternal origin of the long arm of the ring chromosome 2 was detected and confirmed by all the above-mentioned methods. Ring chromosome 2 cases are exceedingly rare. Only 18 cases, including the present one, have been published so far, and our patient is the longest reported survivor, with a 35-year follow-up, and the third case characterized by array-CGH analysis.\n",
      "The association between cryptophthalmos and multiple congenital malformations has been well documented over the last century. Numerous authors have described cases as the cryptophthalmos syndrome, but recently reports of cases without cryptophthalmos have led several authors to use the eponymic designation Fraser syndrome. We have seen seven cases of cryptophthalmos syndrome, including three sib pairs. All presented with cryptophthalmos and bilateral renal agenesis in addition to other characteristic associated malformations. A literature review showed 124 cases in which 27 demonstrated isolated cryptophthalmos, while 97 showed a pattern of multiple congenital malformations. We selected four major and eight minor criteria which enabled us to classify 86 of those cases as having cryptophthalmos syndrome with 11 remaining unclassified. Cryptophthalmos demonstrates equal sex distribution, occurrence in sibs, consanguinity in families with more than one affected child, and lack of vertical transmission--strongly suggesting autosomal recessive inheritance. Isolated cryptophthalmos or cryptophthalmos sequence was sporadic in 16 cases and familial in 11. The familial cases occurred in three families and demonstrated vertical transmission. The pathogenesis of this syndrome is unknown. There are similarities to animal models of maternal vitamin A deprivation and defects in programmed cell death. Cryptophthalmos syndrome should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cases with multiple congenital malformations, especially when they are associated with renal agenesis, even in the absence of cryptophthalmos.\n",
      "A new variant of spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia tarda with mild to moderate mental retardation is described in three daughters born to healthy, consanguineous parents. The mode of inheritance is compatible with that of an autosomal recessive disorder. The identification of this variant is important, as it enables more precise counselling in families in which sporadic cases with this form of presentation are found.\n",
      "Neutral lipid-storage disease with myopathy is caused by mutations in PNPLA2, which produce skeletal and cardiac myopathy. We report a man with multiorgan neutral lipid storage and unusual multisystem clinical involvement, including cognitive impairment.Quantitative brain MRI with voxel-based morphometry and extended neuropsychological assessment were performed. In parallel, the coding sequences and intron/exon boundaries of the PNPLA2 gene were screened by direct sequencing.Neuropsychological assessment revealed global cognitive impairment, and brain MRI showed reduced gray matter volume in the temporal lobes. Molecular characterization revealed a novel homozygous mutation in exon 5 of PNPLA2 (c.714C>A), resulting in a premature stop codon (p.Cys238*).Some PNPLA2 mutations, such as the one described here, may present with an extended phenotype, including brain involvement. In these cases, complete neuropsychological testing, combined with quantitative brain MRI, may help to characterize and quantify cognitive impairment.\n",
      "Hu et al. (1996) and Laporte et al. (1997) recently proposed a novel contiguous gene syndrome of myotubular myopathy, abnormal male genital development and deletion in Xq28. We studied a family where two male infants, both deceased, had myotubular myopathy and intersexual genitalia. Using FISH we detected in the mother a hemizygous deletion including the myotubularin gene MTM1 and F18 (a gene of yet unknown function). DNA studies with STR-markers (short tandem repeats) within and flanking the deleted segment confirmed the deletion in the family and were used for prenatal diagnosis. Our findings confirm the existence of this novel contiguous gene syndrome and support that the deletion of the F18 gene, or a neighboring gene, may cause ambiguous genitalia or severe hypospadias in males. The mother had low muscle power and marked menstrual irregularities which may indicate that she is a manifesting carrier and that the deletion may include a gene (F18 or other) for gonadal function in females.\n",
      "Snyder-Robinson syndrome (SRS, OMIM: 309583) is an X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) syndrome, characterized by a collection of clinical features including facial asymmetry, marfanoid habitus, hypertonia, osteoporosis and unsteady gait. It is caused by a significant decrease or loss of spermine synthase (SMS) activity. Here, we report a new missense mutation, p.Y328C (c.1084A>G), in SMS in a family with XLID. The affected males available for evaluation had mild ID, speech and global delay, an asthenic build, short stature with long fingers and mild kyphosis. The spermine/spermidine ratio in lymphoblasts was 0.53, significantly reduced compared with normal (1.87 average). Activity analysis of SMS in the index patient failed to detect any activity above background. In silico modeling demonstrated that the Y328C mutation has a significant effect on SMS stability, resulting in decreased folding free energy and larger structural fluctuations compared with those of wild-type SMS. The loss of activity was attributed to the increase in conformational dynamics in the mutant which affects the active site geometry, rather than preventing dimer formation. Taken together, the biochemical and in silico studies confirm the p.Y328C mutation in SMS is responsible for the patients having a mild form of SRS and reveal yet another molecular mechanism resulting in a non-functional SMS causing SRS.\n",
      "Homozygous contiguous gene deletion syndromes are rare. On 2p21, however, several overlapping homozygous gene deletion syndromes have been described, all presenting with cystinuria but otherwise distinct phenotypes. Hypotonia-cystinuria syndrome (HCS, OMIM606407) is characterized by infantile hypotonia, poor feeding, and growth hormone deficiency. Affected individuals carry homozygous deletions including the cystinuria gene SLC3A1 and the adjacent PREPL gene. Larger homozygous deletions in this region encompassing the PPM1B, SLC3A1, PREPL, and C2orf34 (CAMKMT) genes result in a more severe phenotype, the 2p21 deletion syndrome. A phenotype intermediate to HCS and the 2p21 deletion syndrome is termed atypical HCS and is caused by deletion of SLC3A1, PREPL, and C2orf34 (CAMKMT). Using high resolution SNP array molecular karyotyping we identified two siblings with a homozygous deletion of 83 kb partially encompassing the genes PREPL and C2orf34 (CAMKMT), but not the SLC3A1 gene. The affected siblings display a recognizable phenotype which is similar to atypical HCS with regard to growth failure and neuro-muscular features, but is characterized by lack of cystinuria. The patients also exhibit features which have not been reported to date such as cleft palate and genital abnormalities. In conclusion, we report the first patients with a homozygous 2p21 deletion syndrome without cystinuria and further delineate the complex genotype-phenotype correlations of homozygous microdeletion syndromes of this region.\n",
      "Two female cousins were found to be affected with severe retinal dystrophy characterised by visual impairment from birth and profound photophobia in the absence of night blindness. Minimal fundus changes with a small foveal atrophy in the older cousin and slight macular pigment epithelial changes suggestive of early bull's eye appearance in the younger were detected, indicative of a cone-rod type of congenital amaurosis. This was associated with trichomegaly, bushy eyebrows with synophyrys, and excessive facial and body hair (including hypertrophied circumareolar hair on the breasts of the older cousin). The mode of inheritance appears to be autosomal recessive.\n",
      "We report a 6 year old boy with multiple fractures owing to bilateral, peculiar, wave-like defects of the tibial corticalis with alternative hyperostosis and thinning. Furthermore, he had Wormian bones of the skull, dentinogenesis imperfecta, and a distinct facial phenotype with hypertelorism and periorbital fullness. Collagen studies showed normal results. His sister, aged 2 years, showed the same facial phenotype and dental abnormalities as well as Wormian bones, but no radiographical abnormalities of the tubular bones so far. The mother also had dentine abnormalities but no skeletal abnormalities on x ray. This entity is probably the same as that described in a sporadic case by Suarez and Stickler in 1974. In spite of the considerable overlap with osteogenesis imperfecta (bone fragility, Wormian bones, and dentinogenesis imperfecta), we believe this disorder to be a different entity, in particular because of the unique cortical defects, missing osteopenia, and normal results of collagen studies.\n",
      "It has been suggested that a genetic factor(s) or a familial predisposition may contribute to the clinical manifestations of disc herniation; moreover, no genetic linkage between spinal disc herniation and spastic paraplegia has ever been described. A family with consanguineous parents and four of eight sibs affected by multiple disc herniations and spastic paraplegia was clinically and genetically analysed. Surgery caused partial improvement in all of them. After the exclusion of type II collagen and vitamin D receptor genes and the recessive loci for HSPs, a genome wide search was performed with about 500 fluorescent markers. Positive lod score values were obtained for chromosome 6q22.31-q24.1, with evidence of three homozygous intervals. The maximum multipoint lod score of 3.28 was obtained in only one interval, between markers D6S1699 and D6S314. On the whole, a susceptibility locus for disc herniation and autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia was found on chromosome 6q23.3-q24.1. This is the first time that disc herniation and the associated neurological syndrome has been linked to a human chromosomal region.\n",
      "We describe a family with a syndrome of mental retardation, dystonic movements of the hands and dysarthria inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern. DNA marker studies gave a maximum lod score of 2.11 at theta of 0.00 for DXS41 with a likely localization of the gene to Xpter----Xp21.\n",
      "A 16p13.3 duplication syndrome has been recently suggested to be a novel recognizable syndrome as a reciprocal microduplication disease of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome. The CREBBP gene is believed to be the dosage-sensitive critical gene responsible for the reciprocal duplication and deletion syndrome. Descriptions so far have been de novo. Here, we report a very rare case of a maternally inherited a¬†-1¬†Mb sized duplication on 16p13.3 identified by SNP array testing. The patient showed moderate intellectual disability, normal growth, and characteristic facial features. The patient's mother also had mild intellectual disability, normal growth, camptodactyly, proximally implanted small thumbs, and distinctive facial features. The study provides additional information that furthers the understanding and delineation of 16p13.3 duplication syndrome.\n",
      "We describe nine previously unreported individuals from six families who have homozygous mutations of HOXA1 and either the Bosley-Salih-Alorainy syndrome (BSAS) or the Athabascan brainstem dysgenesis syndrome (ABDS). Congenital heart disease was present in four BSAS patients, two of whom had neither deafness nor horizontal gaze restriction, thus raising the possibility that cardiovascular malformations might be a clinically isolated, or relatively isolated, manifestation of homozygous HOXA1 mutations. Two ABDS probands had relatively mild mental retardation. These individuals blur the clinical distinctions between the BSAS and ABDS HOXA1 variants and broaden the phenotype and genotype of the homozygous HOXA1 mutation clinical spectrum.\n",
      "Frank-ter Haar syndrome is a rare disorder associated with skeletal, cardiac, ocular and craniofacial features including hypertelorism and brachycephaly. The most common underlying genetic defect in Frank-ter Haar syndrome appears to be a mutation in the SH3PXD2B gene on chromosome 5q35.1. Craniosynostosis, or premature fusion of the calvarial sutures, has not previously been described in Frank-ter Haar syndrome.We present a family of three affected siblings born to consanguineous parents with clinical features in keeping with a diagnosis of Frank-ter Haar syndrome. All three siblings have a novel mutation caused by the deletion of exon 13 of the SH3PXD2B gene. Two of the three siblings also have non-scaphocephalic sagittal synostosis associated with raised intracranial pressure.The clinical features of craniosynostosis and raised intracranial pressure in this family with a confirmed diagnosis of Frank-ter Haar syndrome expand the clinical spectrum of the disease. The abnormal cranial proportions in a mouse model of the disease suggests that the association is not coincidental. The possibility of craniosynostosis should be considered in individuals with a suspected diagnosis of Frank-ter Haar syndrome.\n",
      "To expand the spectrum of bicaudal D, Drosophila, homologue 2 (BICD2) gene-related diseases, which so far includes autosomal dominant spinal muscular atrophy with lower extremity predominance 2 and hereditary spastic paraplegia due to mutations in the BICD2 gene.We analyzed 2 independent German families with clinical, genetic, and muscle MRI studies. In both index patients, muscle histopathologic studies were performed. Transfection studies were carried out to analyze the functional consequences of the disease-causing mutations.We identified the mutations p.Ser107Leu and p.Thr703Met in the BICD2 gene in the 2 families, respectively. In contrast to other patients carrying the same mutations, our patients present features of a myopathy with slow progression. Immunofluorescence studies and immunoelectron microscopy showed striking impairment of Golgi integrity, vesicle pathology, and abnormal BICD2 accumulation either within the nuclei (p.Ser107Leu) or in the perinuclear region (p.Thr703Met). Transfection studies confirmed BICD2 aggregation in different subcellular locations.Our findings extend the phenotypic spectrum of BICD2-associated disorders by features of a chronic myopathy and show a pathomechanism of BICD2 defects in skeletal muscle.\n",
      "It has been described a neuro developmental disorder labelled \"Benign nocturnal alternating hemiplegia of childhood\" (BNAHC) characterized by recurrent attacks of nocturnal hemiplegia without progression to neurological or intellectual impairment. We report a female patient who at 11months revealed a motionless left arm, unusual crying without impairment of consciousness and obvious precipitating factors. The attacks occur during sleep in the early morning with lack of ictal and interictal electroencephalographic abnormalities, progressive neurological deficit, and cognitive impairment. Unlike previous reports of BNAHC our patient come from a family with a history of both migraine, hemiplegic migraine, and sleep disorders. Our study remarks on the typical features described in previous studies and stresses the uncommon aspects that could help to identify the disorder which is likely to have been underestimated. Despite some clinical similarities between BNAHC and familiar hemiplegic migraine and alternating hemiplegia of childhood, the genetic analyses of our patient did not reveal genetic mutations found in both disorders.\n",
      "We report on a 5-year-old girl with a progeroid disorder and compare her to a previously reported woman now in her forties, whom she resembles to a striking degree. Common manifestations include pre- and post-natal growth retardation, markedly diminished subcutaneous fat, wrinkled skin, abnormally scant hair growth, hypoplastic distal phalanges with hypoplastic nails, umbilical hernia, large open anterior fontanelle, and normal cognitive and motor development. Both patients have had a prematurely aged appearance since birth. These 2 patients appear so different from previously reported patients with progeroid disorders that they may represent a separate entity.\n",
      "Inborn defects of cholesterol biosynthesis are metabolic disorders presenting with multi-organ and tissue anomalies. An autosomal recessive defect involving the demethylating enzyme C4-methyl sterol (SC4MOL) has been reported in only 4 patients so far. In infancy, all patients were affected by microcephaly, bilateral congenital cataracts, growth delay, psoriasiform dermatitis, immune dysfunction, and intellectual disability. Herein, we describe a new case of SC4MOL deficiency in which a 19-year-old Italian male was affected by bilateral congenital cataracts, growth delay and learning disabilities, behavioral disorders and small stature, but not microcephaly. Our patient had abundant scalp dandruff, without other skin manifestations. Analysis of the blood sterol profile showed accumulation of C4-monomethyl and C4-dimethyl sterols suggesting a deficiency of the SC4MOL enzyme. Sequencing of the MSMO1 gene (also known as the \"SC4MOL\" gene) confirmed mutations in each allele (c.731A>G, p.Y244C, which is already known, and c.605G>A, p.G202E, which is a novel variant). His father carried c.731A>G mutation, whereas his mother carried c.605G>A. Thus, the combination of multiple skills and methodologies, in particular, blood sterol profiling and genetic analysis, led to the diagnosis of a new case of a very rare defect of cholesterol biosynthesis. Consequently, we suggest that these two analyses should be performed as soon as possible in all undiagnosed patients affected by bilateral cataracts and developmental delay.\n",
      "Hypermethioninemia and absolute methionine intolerance were observed in three siblings. These patients had several peculiar clinical features comprising failure to thrive, mental and motor retardation, facial dysmorphy with abnormal hair and teeth, and myocardiopathy. Hepatic S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase activity was decreased by 80% in the three children. These clinical and biochemical features differ from those of hypermethioninemias previously described, and thus represent a new form of inherited disorder of methionine metabolism. Whether S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase deficiency is primary or secondary to an unknown metabolic defect remains to be determined.\n",
      "Proliferative vasculopathy and hydranencephaly-hydrocephaly syndrome (PVHH, OMIM 225790), also known as Fowler syndrome, is a rare autosomal recessive disorder, caused by mutations in FLVCR2. Hallmarks of the syndrome are glomerular vasculopathy in the central nervous system, severe hydrocephaly, hypokinesia and arthrogryphosis. The disorder is considered prenatally lethal. We report the first patients, a brother and a sister, with Fowler syndrome and survival beyond infancy. The patients present a phenotype of severe intellectual and neurologic disability with seizures, absence of functional movements, and no means of communication. Imaging of the brain showed calcifications, profound ventriculomegaly with only a thin edging of the cerebral cortex and hypoplastic cerebellum. Investigation with whole-exome sequencing (WES) revealed, in both patients, a homozygous pathogenic mutation in FLVCR2, c.1289C>T, compatible with a diagnosis of Fowler syndrome. The results highlight the power of combining WES with a thorough clinical examination in order to identify disease-causing mutations in patients whose clinical presentation differs from previously described cases. Specifically, the findings demonstrate that Fowler syndrome is a diagnosis to consider, not only prenatally but also in severely affected children with gross ventriculomegaly on brain imaging.\n",
      "3-Phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (3-PGDH) deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of serine biosynthesis. It is typically characterized by congenital microcephaly, intractable seizures of infantile onset, and severe psychomotor retardation. Diagnosis is suspected on decreased l-serine levels in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and confirmed by genetic study. Early diagnosis in index cases allows supplementation in serine and prevention of fixed lesions. Prenatal diagnosis and genetic counseling allows prevention of secondary cases. We report on the two first unrelated Tunisian families with 3-PGDH deficiency confirmed by biochemical and genetic study. We discuss clinical, biochemical, imaging, electroencephalographic, and therapeutic aspects and review the literature.\n",
      "We report a patient with developmental delay, autism, epilepsy, macrocephaly, facial dysmorphism, gastrointestinal, and behavioral issues due to EXT2 compound heterozygous likely pathogenic variants. This case report expands the EXT2 gene mutation database and the clinical spectrum of patients with deficiencies in the heparan sulfate pathway.\n",
      "Chromosome 5p13 duplication syndrome (OMIM #613174), a contiguous gene syndrome involving duplication of several genes on chromosome 5p13 including NIPBL (OMIM 608667), has been described in rare patients with developmental delay and learning disability, behavioral problems and peculiar facial dysmorphisms. 5p13 duplications described so far present with variable sizes, from 0.25 to 13.6√Ç¬†Mb, and contain a variable number of genes. Here we report another patient with 5p13 duplication syndrome including NIPBL gene only. Proband's phenotype overlapped that reported in patients with 5p13 microduplication syndrome and especially that of subjects with smaller duplications. Moreover, we better define genotype-phenotype relationship associated with this duplication and confirmed that NIPBL was likely the major dosage sensitive gene for the 5p13 microduplication phenotype.\n",
      "We report a family with brain calcification, predominantly in the basal ganglia, and no evident cause such as abnormal calcium or phosphorus metabolism. The proband, a 48-year-old man, had intellectual decline, parkinsonism, and mild cerebellar ataxia. He had bilateral and symmetric calcification of the basal ganglia, thalamus, dentate nucleus, cerebral cortex, subcortical white matter, and hippocampus on CT. Calcified areas showed low- or high-intensity signals on MRI T1-weighted images, and low-intensity signals on MRI T2-weighted images. Two sons and both parents, all asymptomatic, also showed calcification of the basal ganglia, suggesting an autosomal dominant inheritance. Familial idiopathic brain calcification is a rare disorder with less than 20 previously reported families. Twelve families with autosomal dominant inheritance showed a relatively homogeneous clinical picture, which may represent a distinct clinical entity. Mental deterioration, parkinsonism, and cerebellar ataxia appear in adult life and progress gradually. CT imaging, rather than MRI, is a simple and useful means to screen family members for this condition.\n",
      "Mitochondrial trifunctional protein (MTP) is a multienzyme complex involved in the metabolism of long-chain hydroxyacyl-CoA, a product of the fatty acid Œ≤-oxidation cycle. MTP is an Œ±4Œ≤4 hetero-octomer encoded by two different genes: HADHA (OMIM 600890) and HADHB (OMIM 143450). MTP deficiency induces three different types of presentation: (1) a lethal phenotype with neonatal onset (severe); (2) a hepatic phenotype with infant onset (intermediate); and (3) a neuromyopathic phenotype with late-adolescent onset (mild). While acylcarnitine analysis has revealed increased levels of long-chain hydroxyacylcarnitine in blood when an MTP deficiency exists, the neuromyopathic type is usually asymptomatic and does not always result in an abnormality in acylcarnitine analysis results. We report here the case of a 13-year-old girl with recurrences of intermittent myalgia since her early childhood, for whom the disorder had not been definitely diagnosed. Since she was referred to our hospital because of rhabdomyolysis, we have repeatedly performed blood acylcarnitine analysis and found slight increases in long-chain 3-OH-acylcarnitine levels, on the basis of which we made a chemical diagnosis of MTP deficiency. Immunoblot analysis of skin fibroblasts revealed loss of Œ±- and Œ≤-subunits of MTP. In addition, analysis of the HADHB gene, which encodes long-chain 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase, one of the enzymes constituting MTP, identified compound heterozygous mutations of c.520C>T (p.R141C) and c.1331G>A (p.R411K). MTP deficiency is considered an extremely rare disorder, as only five cases (lethal phenotype, two patients; hepatic phenotype, two patients; and neuromyopathic phenotype, one patient) have thus far been reported in Japan. However, it is likely that the neuromyopathic phenotype of MTP deficiency has not yet been diagnosed among patients with recurrences of intermittent myalgia and rhabdomyolysis, as in our patient reported here.\n",
      "Two male siblings presented in infancy with hyponatremia. The levels of plasma renin activity and aldosterone were elevated. Sodium supplement was necessary to maintain normal sodium balance. The salivary sodium concentrations were markedly elevated, with sweat sodium levels being in the upper normal range. Urinary sodium concentration and renal epithelial exchange between sodium and potassium were normal. This was felt to be due to an autosomal recessive disorder. Both siblings were later diagnosed as having a bilateral moderate to severe sensorineural hearing loss with intermittent conductive overlay due to middle ear fluid. The sensorineural loss was also felt to be autosomal recessive in origin, but the possibility of a disturbance of sodium balance in the inner ear has been questioned.\n",
      "Nonketotic hyperglycinemia is a rare metabolic disorder with severe, frequently fatal, neurologic manifestations. Reliable and accurate diagnosis depends on careful interpretation of laboratory findings. The clinical suspicion should lead to determination of glycine in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. Amino acid analysis presents diagnostic values for classic nonketotic hyperglycinemia, but it also should be performed in suspected cases of atypical nonketotic hyperglycinemia and in children with seizures, failure to thrive, behavior problems, and uncoordinated movements. Clinical assessment should be reinforced by demonstration of elevated cerebrospinal fluid-to-plasma glycine ratio. Confirmatory diagnosis requires enzymatic and genetic investigation of glycine cleavage system. An early diagnosis, though not affecting clinical outcome, allows proper genetic counseling, with the possibility of prenatal diagnosis. We report 3 cases of nonketotic hyperglycinemia, 2 typical neonatal and 1 atypical, diagnosed in Pediatric Hospital of Coimbra, Portugal, and investigated at Laboratory of Biochemical Genetics in 2004 to 2010 (incidence 1:47 455; prevalence 1:782 951).\n",
      "Roifman syndrome is a rare syndrome of bone dysplasia, growth retardation, retinal dystrophy and humeral immunodeficiency. Six cases have been reported to date, all of whom are male. We report a boy with clinical features of Roifman syndrome, whose older sister has skewed X-inactivation and a milder phenotype of the same disorder, supporting the hypothesis that this is an X-linked recessive condition. Both children had previously had a provisional diagnosis of Jeune dysplasia, and the boy had neonatal hip X-rays which demonstrated 'acetabular spurs' which are seen in a number of diseases thought to be caused by dysfunction of nonmotile cilia, including Jeune asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy. This finding in combination with other features such as retinal dystrophy, hepatic and renal disease suggests that the gene which is affected in Roifman syndrome may be involved with the function of nonmotile cilia and that Roifman syndrome may be the first example of a ciliopathy with associated immunodeficiency.\n",
      "Hydrolethalus syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by hydrocephalus, micrognathia, limb anomalies and several other abnormalities, mostly in the midline structures. The syndrome was first described in Finland, where the incidence is approximately 1 in 20000. All of the Finnish patients were stillborn or died during the first day of life. Only three non-Finnish cases have survived beyond the neonatal period. Here, we report the first Oriental girl with a 'milder' form of hydrolethalus syndrome. The patient died at age 44 days making her the fourth reported case surviving beyond the neonatal period. The case supports the concept of a 'milder' form of the syndrome. Whether this spectrum is due to allelism or locus heterogeneity awaits molecular analysis.\n",
      "Patients with teeth showing all of the clinical, radiographic, and histologic features of radicular dentine dysplasia (type I) have been found to have dense sclerotic bone and skeletal anomalies of the wrists and hand bones. The association of these defects of teeth and bone was found to be transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait over four generations. Review of theliterature failed to disclose a previous description of this disorder.\n",
      "The endothelin receptor type A (EDNRA) signaling pathway is essential for the establishment of mandibular identity during development of the first pharyngeal arch. We report four unrelated individuals with the syndrome mandibulofacial dysostosis with alopecia (MFDA) who have de novo missense variants in EDNRA. Three of the four individuals have the same substitution, p.Tyr129Phe. Tyr129 is known to determine the selective affinity of EDNRA for endothelin 1 (EDN1), its major physiological ligand, and the p.Tyr129Phe variant increases the affinity of the receptor for EDN3, its non-preferred ligand, by two orders of magnitude. The fourth individual has a somatic mosaic substitution, p.Glu303Lys, and was previously described as having Johnson-McMillin syndrome. The zygomatic arch of individuals with MFDA resembles that of mice in which EDNRA is ectopically activated in the maxillary prominence, resulting in a maxillary to mandibular transformation, suggesting that the p.Tyr129Phe variant causes an EDNRA gain of function in the developing upper jaw. Our in¬†vitro and in¬†vivo assays suggested complex, context-dependent effects of the EDNRA variants on downstream signaling. Our findings highlight the importance of finely tuned regulation of EDNRA signaling during human craniofacial development and suggest that modification of endothelin receptor-ligand specificity was a key step in the evolution of vertebrate jaws.\n",
      "Newborn screening (NBS) by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) has allowed for early detection and initiation of treatment in many patients with maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) (OMIM 248600), however, a recent report suggests that variants forms may be missed. Information on these patients is limited. We present clinical, biochemical and molecular information on patients with variant forms of MSUD not detected by the California Newborn Screening Program. Between July 2005 and July 2009, 2200,000 newborns were screened in California by MS/MS. Seventeen cases of MSUD were detected and three (two siblings) were missed. Additionally, the NBS cards of two siblings with late onset MSUD, who were born pre-expanded NBS, were retrospectively analyzed. None of the five patients met criteria to be considered presumptive positive for MSUD (leucine>200micromol/L and a ratio of leucine/alanine>or=1.5). Alloisoleucine (allo-ile) was subsequently analyzed in the NBS cards of all five patients, two of whom were found to have elevated levels. The proband in each family was diagnosed following symptoms triggered by an intercurrent illness or increased protein intake. At diagnosis, leucine levels ranged between 561 and >4528micromol/L, and allo-ile ranged from 137 to 239micromol/L. Two affected siblings had normal plasma amino acids when asymptomatic; however, their biochemical profiles were diagnostic of MSUD during intercurrent illnesses. The median age at diagnosis of all patients was one year (range 0.8-6.7). Heterozygous BCKDHB (E1beta) mutations (c.832G>A/c.970C>T) were identified in one family and a homozygous DBT (E2) sequence variant (c.1430 T>G) in another. The third family had one identifiable DBT mutation (c.827T>G), however, a second mutation was not detected. This report provides further evidence that NBS by MS/MS is unable to detect all cases of MSUD. Second-tier testing with allo-ile may improve sensitivity; however, some children with variant forms will invariably be missed.\n",
      "Larsen syndrome is characterized by multiple joint dislocations, associated with a typical facial appearance and frequently other abnormalities. Both dominant and recessive patterns of inheritance have been reported. A lethal form of Larsen syndrome (Larsen-like syndrome) has been described as a combination of the Larsen phenotype and pulmonary hypoplasia. In this report, we present a 24-week-old female fetus with a possible prenatal diagnosis of thanatophoric dysplasia in whom postmortem examination revealed lethal type Larsen-like syndrome associated with bifid tongue, severe micrognathia and non-immune hydrops fetalis. These findings have not been reported previously in the lethal type Larsen syndrome.\n",
      "Distal arthrogryposis syndromes (DAs) show wide clinical variability and overlapping clinical findings with the other DAs classified by Bamshad et al. [1996]. Most of the DAs are inherited as autosomal dominant disorders. DA type 5D is a subtype of DA type 5 inherited as autosomal recessive disorder, clinically characterized by congenital distal joint contractures, knee extension contractures, congenital hip dislocation, club foot, ptosis and other eye findings, furrowed tongue, and scoliosis. Here, we report on a family with clinical features of DA type 5D with novel mutations in the ECEL1 gene.\n",
      "Severe influenza disease strikes otherwise healthy children and remains unexplained. We report compound heterozygous null mutations in IRF7, which encodes the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 7, in an otherwise healthy child who suffered life-threatening influenza during primary infection. In response to influenza virus, the patient's leukocytes and plasmacytoid dendritic cells produced very little type I and III interferons (IFNs). Moreover, the patient's dermal fibroblasts and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived pulmonary epithelial cells produced reduced amounts of type I IFN and displayed increased influenza virus replication. These findings suggest that IRF7-dependent amplification of type I and III IFNs is required for protection against primary infection by influenza virus in humans. They also show that severe influenza may result from single-gene inborn errors of immunity.\n",
      "Troyer syndrome (MIM#275900) is an autosomal recessive form of complicated hereditary spastic paraplegia. It is characterized by progressive lower extremity spasticity and weakness, dysarthria, distal amyotrophy, developmental delay, short stature, and subtle skeletal abnormalities. It is caused by deleterious mutations in the SPG20 gene, encoding spartin, on Chromosome 13q13. Until now, six unrelated families with a genetically confirmed diagnosis have been reported. Here we report the clinical findings in three brothers of a consanguineous Moroccan family, aged 24, 17, and 7 yr old, with spastic paraplegia, short stature, motor and cognitive delay, and severe intellectual disability. Targeted exon capture and sequencing showed a homozygous nonsense mutation in the SPG20 gene, c.1369C>T (p.Arg457*), in the three affected boys.\n",
      "We report on an infant (born to consanguineous parents) with an unusual face, microphthalmia, cleft palate, dextrocardia, choreoathetosis, and mental retardation. This child has many traits in common with an infant recently described by Aughton [1990] as a probable new syndrome.\n",
      "Deletions of the long arm of chromosome 20 are rare. Here, we report on two girls with a very small interstitial deletion of the long arm of chromosome 20 presenting with severe pre- and post-natal growth retardation, intractable feeding difficulties, abnormal subcutaneous adipose tissue, similar facial dysmorphism, psychomotor retardation and hypotonia. Standard cytogenetic studies were normal, but high-resolution chromosomes analysis showed the presence of a chromosome (20)(q13.2-q13.3) interstitial deletion. Karyotypes of both parents were normal. Molecular studies using FISH and microsatellite polymorphic markers showed that the deletion was of paternal origin and was approximatively 4.5 Mb in size. A review of other reported patients with similar deletions of the long arm of chromosome 20 shows that the observed phenotype might be explained in the light of the GNAS imprinted locus in particular by the absence of the Gnasxl paternally imprinted gene and the TFA2PC gene in the deleted genetic interval.\n",
      "Au-Kline syndrome (AKS, OMIM 616580) is a multiple malformation syndrome, first reported in 2015, associated with intellectual disability. AKS has been associated with de novo loss-of-function variants in HNRNPK (heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein K), and to date, only four of these patients have been described in the literature. Recently, an additional patient with a missense variant in HNRNPK was also reported. These patients have striking facial dysmorphic features, including long palpebral fissures, ptosis, deeply grooved tongue, broad nose, and down-turned mouth. Patients frequently also have skeletal and connective tissue anomalies, craniosynostosis, congenital heart malformations, and renal anomalies. In this report, we describe six new patients and review the clinical information on all reported AKS patients, further delineating the phenotype of AKS. There are now a total of 9 patients with de novo loss-of-function variants in HNRNPK, one individual with a de novo missense variant in addition to 3 patients with de novo deletions of 9q21.32 that encompass HNRNPK. While there is considerable overlap between AKS and Kabuki syndrome (KS), these additional patients demonstrate that AKS does have a distinct facial gestalt and phenotype that can be differentiated from KS. This growing AKS patient cohort also informs an emerging approach to management and health surveillance for these patients.\n",
      "Aplasia cutis congenita (ACC) is a rare skin defect usually localized to the vertex. It has been reported in association with other disorders involving mainly ectodermal and mesodermal structures. We discovered the association of ACC and intestinal lymphangiectasia (IL) in a patient and probably in his brother. At birth, the propositus had ACC of the vertex and edema, which persisted for six months. At 3 years of age he presented with generalized edema and was found to have hypoproteinemia and lymphopenia. Radioisotope studies and a small-intestinal biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of IL. On a fat-free, medium-chain triglyceride-containing diet, clinical and laboratory findings returned to normal. A sibling born one year after his brother's presentation had nonpitting limb edema and extensive ACC of the vertex with an underlying bony defect. He died in shock at 2 months of age, after sudden profuse bleeding from the sagittal sinus. The association between ACC and IL is another example of combined anomalies with both ectodermal and mesodermal involvement that is most probably not coincidental.\n",
      "We encountered two family members with a previously undescribed pure ectodermal dysplasia. The propositus exhibited hypotrichosis, hypodontia, focal linear dermal hypoplasia on the tip of her nose, irregular hyperpigmentation on her back, bilateral amastia and athelia, and mild nerve hearing loss. Her mother displayed similar characteristics, except for present, although hypoplastic, areolae and nipples. Both mother and daughter appeared to be clinically euhidrotic. Despite a comprehensive endocrine workup, the only abnormality detected was a suboptimal cortisol response to hypoglycemia in the propositus. Five other family members seemed to be affected. The pattern of inheritance appeared to be autosomal-dominant, with variable penetrance and expressivity.\n",
      "We present the first two reported unrelated patients with an isolated sedoheptulokinase (SHPK) deficiency. The first patient presented with neonatal cholestasis, hypoglycemia, and anemia, while the second patient presented with congenital arthrogryposis multiplex, multiple contractures, and dysmorphisms. Both patients had elevated excretion of erythritol and sedoheptulose, and each had a homozygous nonsense mutation in SHPK. SHPK is an enzyme that phosphorylates sedoheptulose to sedoheptulose-7-phosphate, which is an important intermediate of the pentose phosphate pathway. It is questionable whether SHPK deficiency is a causal factor for the clinical phenotypes of our patients. This study illustrates the necessity of extensive functional and clinical workup for interpreting a novel variant, including nonsense variants.\n",
      "Features of both the Goldenhar and the caudal regression syndromes were found in the patient described. A search of the literature revealed two other patients having both conditions. However, a number of other individuals have been reported with Goldenhar or related syndromes who have malformations in the caudal region or, conversely, who have the caudal regression syndrome and possess cranial anomalies. Possible explanations for the commonality of malformations seen in these syndromes are presented and discussed. It is suggested that the term, \"axial mesodermal dysplasia spectrum\" be used in patients manifesting this overlap to emphasize the importance of searching for the other malformations seen in this spectrum of anomalies.\n",
      "Patients suffering from deletions of chromosome 18 (p-, q-) show regularly short stature. Endocrinological investigations were performed to prove if short stature is due to pituitary insufficiency. In three female patients with deletions of chromosome 18 and retarded bone age serum growth hormone was investigated after insulin induced hypoglycemia, after glucagon-propranolol and after stimulation with growth hormone releasing hormone. Thyroid function, gonadal function and adrenal function were investigated too. All three patients showed growth hormone deficiency. In one patient there were found in addition hypothyroidism and gonadotrophine deficiency as well. In conclusion growth failure in some patients with deletions of chromosome 18 seems to due to pituitary insufficiency. In these patients treatment with recombinant growth hormone may increase growth velocity.\n",
      "We describe two brothers, 11 and 13 years old, respectively, with an early-onset hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy, deafness, and mental retardation. Electrophysiological studies showed marked reduction of motor and sensory conduction velocity and absence of sensory action potentials. Sural nerve biopsy, performed in both patients, showed absence of large myelinated fibers with normal density of small myelinated fibers without axonal degeneration. Signs of demyelination were found only in the younger patient. We suggest that motorsensory neuropathy associated with deafness and mental retardation with absence of large myelinated fibers on sural nerve biopsy represents a distinct clinicopathological entity, which is transmitted in families probably as an autosomal recessive trait.\n",
      "Gingival fibromatosis is a rare and heterogeneous group of disorders that develop as slowly progressive, local or diffuse enlargements within marginal and attached gingiva or interdental papilla. In severe cases, the excess tissue may cover the crowns of the teeth, thus causing functional, esthetic, and periodontal problems, such as bone loss and bleeding, due to the presence of pseudopockets and plaque accumulation. It affects both genders equally. Hereditary, drug-induced, and idiopathic gingival overgrowth have been reported. Hereditary gingival fibromatosis can occur as an isolated condition or as part of a genetic syndrome. The pathologic manifestation of gingival fibromatosis comprises excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix proteins, of which collagen type I is the most prominent example. Mutation in the Son-of-Sevenless-1 gene has been suggested as one possible etiological cause of isolated (non-syndromic) hereditary gingival fibromatosis, but mutations in other genes are also likely to be involved, given the heterogeneity of this condition. The most attractive concept of mechanism for drug-induced gingival overgrowth is epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, a process in which interactions between gingival cells and the extracellular matrix are weakened as epithelial cells transdifferentiate into fibrogenic fibroblast-like cells. The diagnosis is mainly made on the basis of the patient's history and clinical features, and on histopathological evaluation of affected gingiva. Early diagnosis is important, mostly to exclude oral malignancy. Differential diagnosis comprises all pathologies in the mouth with excessive gingival overgrowth. Hereditary gingival fibromatosis may present as an autosomal-dominant or less commonly autosomal-recessive mode of inheritance. If a systemic disease or syndrome is suspected, the patient is directed to a geneticist for additional clinical examination and specialized diagnostic tests. Treatments vary according to the type of overgrowth and the extent of disease progression, thus, scaling of teeth is sufficient in mild cases, while in severe cases surgical intervention is required. Prognosis is precarious and the risk of recurrence exists.\n",
      "Mutations in the gene encoding the iron-sulfur-containing DNA helicase DDX11 (ChlR1) were recently identified as a cause of a new recessive cohesinopathy, Warsaw breakage syndrome (WABS), in a single patient with severe microcephaly, pre- and postnatal growth retardation, and abnormal skin pigmentation. Here, using homozygosity mapping in a Lebanese consanguineous family followed by exome sequencing, we identified a novel homozygous mutation (c.788G>A [p.R263Q]) in DDX11 in three affected siblings with severe intellectual disability and many of the congenital abnormalities reported in the WABS original case. Cultured lymphocytes from the patients showed increased mitomycin C-induced chromosomal breakage, as found in WABS. Biochemical studies of purified recombinant DDX11 indicated that the p.R263Q mutation impaired DDX11 helicase activity by perturbing its DNA binding and DNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis. Our findings thus confirm the involvement of DDX11 in WABS, describe its phenotypical spectrum, and provide novel insight into the structural requirement for DDX11 activity.\n",
      "Scapuloperoneal spinal muscular atrophy (SPSMA) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder caused by heterozygous mutations in the transient receptor potential cation channel (TRPV4) gene, characterized by progressive scapuloperoneal atrophy and weakness. Additional features, such as vocal cord paralysis, scoliosis and/or arthrogryposis, are likely to occur. We report the first Italian family with SPSMA, harboring the c.806G>A mutation in TRPV4 gene (p. R269H). The pattern of expression was variable: the father showed a mild muscular involvement, while the son presented at birth skeletal dysplasia and a progressive course. We reinforce the concept that the disease can be more severe in the following generations. The disorder should be considered in scapuloperoneal syndromes with autosomal dominant inheritance and a neurogenic pattern. The presence of skeletal deformities strongly supports this suspicion. An early diagnosis of SPSMA may be crucial in order to prevent the more severe congenital form.\n",
      "An autosomal dominant genodermatosis that is characterized by painful callosities develops over pressure points. Histologically, these lesions are similar to epidermal nevi.\n",
      "The term ermine phenotype has been chosen to describe patients with white hair with black tufts. The patients also have sensorineural hearing loss. This rare phenotype may come about either by failure of migration of melanocytes or by an autoimmune mechanism. Examples of each are cited. The authors describe a possible third type. Comparison with other pigment loss-sensorineural hearing loss syndromes is made.\n",
      "We report on a 7-year-old Japanese girl with Mutchinick syndrome, a rare congenital malformation syndrome described in a pair of Argentinean sisters and a pair of German brothers; both originating from the same geographic region in the former East Prussia. The girl we describe had most of the clinical manifestations of the syndrome, including growth and developmental retardation, and craniofacial anomalies with microcephaly, hypertelorism, a broad straight nose, low-set malformed ears, and a wide, tented mouth. She also had the following hitherto undescribed manifestations: ventricular septal defect, palmoplantar hyperkeratosis, bilateral partial soft-tissue syndactyly of second and third toes, and megaloureters. The occurrence of the syndrome in a Japanese girl indicates that the syndrome is not restricted to the descendants of individuals from a confined region in northeastern Europe.\n",
      "In Liaoning Province in northeastern China, we found a G6PD-deficient patient at the age of 3. By the classification of the World Health Organization, this patient was categorized as class I (very severe G6PD deficiency). When we investigated the G6PD gene of the patient, we found that he had a replacement of G to A at nucleotide 1339. As a result, the amino acid at position 447 should change from Gly to Arg. This replacement is known as G6PD Santiago de Cuba, because it was first discovered in a Cuban boy who showed heavy chronic anemia. Today, 28 G6PD variants have been reported in the Chinese population, and all are categorized as class II (severe deficiency) or class III (mild deficiency); in class II or III deficiency, anemia is not present in daily life, but hemolytic attack can occur when the carrier ingests certain oxidative medicines or foods. This is the first report of a G6PD-deficient Chinese patient in the category of class I. We intended to find other G6PD-deficient cases in northeastern China and tested several hundred blood samples, but no cases of G6PD deficiency were found (0/414). In central China, where falciparum malaria was endemic from the 1950s to 1970s, we found two G6PD-deficient cases (2/27) and the other members from their families whose variant type was G6PD Kaiping (1388G > T), which is a common variant in the Chinese population.\n",
      "Mesoaxial synostotic syndactyly, Malik-Percin type (MSSD) (syndactyly type IX) is a rare autosomal-recessive nonsyndromic digit anomaly with only two affected families reported so far. We previously showed that the trait is genetically distinct from other syndactyly types, and through autozygosity mapping we had identified a locus on chromosome 17p13.3 for this unique limb malformation. Here, we extend the number of independent pedigrees from various geographic regions segregating MSSD to a total of six. We demonstrate that three neighboring missense mutations affecting the highly conserved DNA-binding region of the basic helix-loop-helix A9 transcription factor (BHLHA9) are associated with this phenotype. Recombinant BHLHA9 generated by transient gene expression is shown to be located in the cytoplasm and the cell nucleus. Transcription factors 3, 4, and 12, members of the E protein (class I) family of helix-loop-helix transcription factors, are highlighted in yeast two-hybrid analysis as potential dimerization partners for BHLHA9. In√Ç¬†the presence of BHLHA9, the potential of these three proteins to activate expression of an E-box-regulated target gene is reduced considerably. BHLHA9 harboring one of the three substitutions detected in MSSD-affected individuals eliminates entirely the transcription activation by these class I bHLH proteins. We conclude that by dimerizing with other bHLH protein monomers, BHLHA9 could fine tune the expression of regulatory factors governing determination of central limb mesenchyme cells, a function made impossible by altering critical amino acids in the DNA binding domain. These findings identify BHLHA9 as an essential player in the regulatory network governing limb morphogenesis in humans.\n",
      "We report on a mother and son with high forehead; elongated and flattened face; arched, sparse eyebrows; short palpebral fissures; telecanthus; long nose and hypoplastic nostrils; long philtrum; microstomia; high, narrow palate; nasal speech; chin dimples; and a highly unusual bilateral auricular malformation. Intelligence and hearing are normal, and there is no \"whistling\" face or deviation of fingers. Although resembling in some ways the Freeman-Sheldon syndrome, this phenotype most likely represents a new malformation syndrome, either autosomal dominant or X-linked dominant.\n",
      "Porokeratotic eccrine ostial and dermal duct nevus (PEODDN) is a rare variant of porokeratosis with characteristic histological feature of cornoid lamella involving the acrosyringium. We report a classic case of a 20-year-old male, who clinically presented to us with keratotic papules and plaque with pits, few having comedo like plugs, on right palm and sole since 1 year of age. A punch biopsy from palm was diagnostic as well as confirmatory showing cornoid lamella involving an eccrine duct which is the characteristic histopathological feature of PEODDN.\n",
      "BACKGROUND:Periodic vestibulocerebellar ataxia is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by defective smooth pursuit, gaze-evoked nystagmus, ataxia, and vertigo. The age of onset ranges from the third to the sixth decade. To date, all patients have originated from North Carolina, suggesting a single common founder. OBJECTIVE:To clarify the classification of periodic vestibulocerebellar ataxia by determining whether it is allelic to other autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias for which genes have been either localized or identified. METHODS:Blood was collected and DNA isolated from 66 subjects (19 affected individuals) in two multigenerational families. The microsatellite markers used in the analysis either flanked or were tightly linked to the disease gene regions. Two-point and multipoint linkage analyses were performed to define the limits of exclusion. RESULTS:Periodic vestibulocerebellar ataxia was excluded from loci linked to spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (chromosome 6p), type 2 (chromosome 12q) type 3/Machado/Joseph disease (chromosome 14q), type 4 (chromosome 16q), and type 5 (11cent) as well as to episodic ataxia with myokymia (chromosome 12p), episodic ataxia with nystagmus (chromosome 19p), acetazolamide-responsive hereditary paroxysmal cerebellar ataxia (chromosome 19p), and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy/Haw River syndrome (chromosome 12p). CONCLUSION:Periodic vestibulocerebellar ataxia is genetically distinct from those autosomal dominant ataxias for which chromosomal localization has been established.\n",
      "We describe a hitherto apparently undescribed ectodermal dysplasia in four siblings. The condition combines severe hypotrichosis, hypoplasia of enamel leading to secondary anodontia, dystrophic nails, supernumerary nipples, nevus pigmentosus, bone deficiency of the fronto-parietal region, and other anomalies. This condition is probably due to an autosomal-recessive gene. ?\n",
      "Familial occurrence of M√©n√©trier disease is rare and has been reported only in few instances.Affected patients from a large pedigree were evaluated at the clinical, endoscopic, and pathological levels.Affected members presented with gastropathy of variable severity but without protein loss. Endoscopy and pathology findings were consistent with M√©n√©trier disease; however, gastric transforming growth factor Œ± (TGF-Œ±) immunohistochemistry and real-time polymerase chain reaction showed no increase in TGF-Œ± expression.We describe a unique, 4-generation pedigree with autosomal dominant gastropathy exhibiting the typical clinical, endoscopic, and pathological findings of M√©n√©trier-like disease, though in the absence of protein loss and with no increase in the levels of gastric TGF-Œ±. Members of this family may be affected by a novel and previously unrecognised hereditary form of gastric hyperplasia.\n",
      "A new syndrome with unique facial features, anorexia, cachexia, eye and skin anomalies affecting three family members is described. A possible mode of inheritance is suggested and various aspects of the phenotype are discussed.\n",
      "Hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy with proximal dominant involvement (HMSN-P) is an autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative disorder characterized by widespread fasciculations, proximal-predominant muscle weakness, and atrophy followed by distal sensory involvement. To date, large families affected by HMSN-P have been reported from two different regions in Japan. Linkage and haplotype analyses of two previously reported families and two new families with the use of high-density SNP arrays further defined the minimum candidate region of 3.3 Mb in chromosomal region 3q12. Exome sequencing showed an identical c.854C>T (p.Pro285Leu) mutation in the TRK-fused gene (TFG) in the four families. Detailed haplotype analysis suggested two independent origins of the mutation. Pathological studies of an autopsied patient revealed TFG- and ubiquitin-immunopositive cytoplasmic inclusions in the spinal and cortical motor neurons. Fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus, a frequent finding in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, was also observed in the motor neurons with inclusion bodies. Moreover, TAR DNA-binding protein 43√Ç¬†kDa (TDP-43)-positive cytoplasmic inclusions were also demonstrated. In cultured cells expressing mutant TFG, cytoplasmic aggregation of TDP-43 was demonstrated. These findings indicate that formation of TFG-containing cytoplasmic inclusions and concomitant mislocalization of TDP-43 underlie motor neuron degeneration in HMSN-P. Pathological overlap of proteinopathies involving TFG and TDP-43 highlights a new pathway leading to motor neuron degeneration.\n",
      "We report a case of galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase (GALT) deficiency in a full-term Chinese neonate, who presented with atypical biochemical features of hyperammonaemia in addition to the classical presenting features of jaundice and lethargy after feeding. Red cell GALT activity was virtually absent in the patient while 50% of normal activity was found in parents and a sibling. Mutation screening excluded both Q188R and N314D as the causative mutation in GALT gene, which suggested a possible genetic segregation among ethnic groups. Data from a Taiwan screening program suggested that the incidence of the disease was approximately 1 in 400 000 in the Chinese population which was a sixth of that in Caucasian populations.\n",
      "A 17-year-old boy with Kallmann syndrome had complex congenital heart disease that included double-outlet right ventricle, d-mal-position of the great arteries, right aortic arch, and hypoplastic main pulmonary artery. He had neurosensory hearing loss and mental retardation. The 7 previously reported patients with Kallmann syndrome and cardiac abnormalities were short with height > or = 2 standard deviations below the mean for age (5/7), lacked a family history of Kallmann syndrome (6/6), and were mentally retarded (4/4). Patients presenting with Kallmann syndrome and congenital heart defects appear to represent a distinct subgroup of patients with Kallmann syndrome. The cause of this association is unclear, but may involve either autosomal recessive inheritance, sporadic dominant mutation, or a shared teratogenic event during the first trimester of gestation.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To report a case of laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) surgery performed in a patient with likely central cloudy corneal dystrophy of Francois (CCDF). DESIGN: Observational case report. METHODS: A 48-year-old woman with likely CCDF had myopic LASIK to establish monovision. Outcome measures included visual acuity, manifest refraction, and slit-lamp examination. RESULTS: At 5-year follow-up, the patient had uncorrected visual acuity of 20/100, J1, in the right eye (OD) and 20/20 in the left eye (OS), consistent with monovision correction. Manifest refraction was -1.50 OD and -0.25 OS postoperatively; after retreatment at 1 year for regression, the left eye remained stable over the subsequent 4-year period. Slit-lamp examination revealed no progression of corneal opacities in either eye. CONCLUSIONS: LASIK may be safe and effective in patients with CCDF. Further observations of a greater number of patients are required to confirm these findings.\n",
      "Primary torsion dystonia is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of movement disorders. Fifteen different types of dystonia have been described to date, of whom 14 loci have been mapped, but only seven genes identified. Several different modes of inheritance have been described, including autosomal dominant transmission with reduced penetrance (12 loci), recessive X-linked (one locus), and autosomal recessive transmission (three loci). In this study, we describe the localization of a novel form of autosomal recessive, primary focal torsion dystonia using a genomewide search in a large consanguineous Lebanese family with three affected individuals. Homozygosity mapping with 382 microsatellite markers was conducted. Linkage analysis and haplotype construction allowed us to identify a novel locus designated as DYT17, within a 20.5-Mb interval on chromosome 20. Of the 270 known genes spread on this interval, 27 candidate genes were tested and excluded as responsible for the disease. Fine mapping by identification of other dystonia families linked to chromosome 20 and sequencing of candidate genes in the refined interval is required in order to identify the causative gene in DYT17.\n",
      "A previously undescribed syndrome of bilateral blepharoptosis, ectopia lentis, and high myopia apparently was dominantly inherited and originated from a spontaneous genetic mutation. The syndrome seems to be caused by a decrease in the tensile strength of the levator aponeurosis, the zonules, and the sclera.\n",
      "Homozygosity mapping and exome sequencing in two affected siblings of a consanguineous family with mild intellectual disability, spastic paraplegia, and strabismus revealed a homozygous premature stop mutation at codon 139 of C12ORF65. Two previous studies reported truncating mutations at positions 84 and 132 of the protein. However, symptoms of the referred patients were only partially overlapping. Considering our findings, we now conclude that truncating mutations in C12ORF65 lead to a variable phenotype with intellectual disability, spastic paraplegia, and ophthalmoplegia as common symptoms. Further, we confirm a genotype-phenotype correlation between increasing length of the truncated protein and decreasing severity of symptoms.\n",
      "CONTEXT: Among 22 independent patients from the GENHYPOPIT network who had ACTH deficiency and no identified mutation of TPIT, three of them (13.6%) displayed common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), characterized by defective Ig production. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to describe an as yet unrecognized disease association. DESIGN: We considered the hypothesis of ACTH deficiency being associated with antipituitary autoimmunity or lymphocytic hypophysitis. In the context of a functional network between the immune and endocrine systems, we also tested the hypothesis of a common genetic cause using a candidate gene approach. SETTING: This was a multicentric study in three academic hospitals. PATIENTS: We report four patients from three unrelated families presenting with ACTH deficiency and CVID. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Detection of antipituitary autoantibodies, and sequencing of candidate genes (LIF, IKAROS, EOS) were the main outcome measures. RESULTS: All patients including a pedigree with two affected siblings had ACTH deficit diagnosed from 5-15 yr, with symptomatic hypoglycemia, and CVID diagnosed from 2-8 yr revealed by recurrent infections. Three of the four patients had a hypoplastic pituitary. One patient had low IGF-I and subnormal GH response to stimulation, suggesting that secretion of other pituitary hormones may also be affected. All patients proved negative for pituitary autoantibodies and had no alteration in any of the genes tested. CONCLUSIONS: The remarkable association of two rare disorders affecting two functionally related systems in four patients from three independent pedigrees including a familial case provides strong evidence of the existence of a disease association: deficit in anterior pituitary function and variable immune deficiency, or DAVID.\n",
      "We report on four Japanese sibs (three brothers and one sister) with a previously unreported syndrome of spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, craniosynostosis, cataracts, cleft palate, and mental retardation. Most clinical manifestations were evident neonatally, but skeletal changes and cataracts became substantial in early childhood. Radiological anomalies comprised coronal synostosis, mild epiphyseal dysplasia, particularly in the distal tibiae, strikingly delayed patellar ossification, mild metaphyseal splaying, hypoplastic ilia with iliac flare, and platyspondyly with ovoid-shaped or posteriorly humped vertebral bodies. The nonconsanguineous parents were mildly mentally retarded, and sibs of both gender were equally affected; thus, inheritance was likely autosomal recessive.\n",
      "The hallmark of Sturge-Weber syndrome is leptomeningeal angiomatosis. Over 15 years, four children were identified (2 boys, age 2.9-6 years) with unilateral facial port-wine stain, referred for presumable Sturge-Weber syndrome but who were also autistic. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scans failed to show evidence of leptomeningeal angioma in all four children. Three of the children had a history of seizures. Detailed neuropsychologic testing of three children revealed a similar presentation, characterized by developmental disturbance, particularly involving delayed onset of language, and early-emerging social atypicality. Positron emission tomography scanning of cerebral glucose metabolism revealed hypometabolism in the bilateral medial temporal regions, anterior cingulate gyrus, frontal cortex, right temporal cortex, and cerebellum. The pattern of glucose hypometabolism differed from that of 12 children with infantile autism (age 2.7-7.9 years) who had mild left medial temporal but more severe right temporal cortical hypometabolism and showed a reversal of normal frontotemporal asymmetry of glucose metabolism. Unilateral facial port-wine stain and autism with no intracranial angioma on conventional imaging may represent a rare clinical entity distinct from both infantile autism and previously described variants of Sturge-Weber syndrome.\n",
      "Three patients are reported, including two dizygotic twins born to consanguineous parents, presenting with a disorder characterized by growth retardation, microcephaly, distinct facial features with hypotelorism, with or without epicanthic folds, prominent lips, low set ears, tetralogy of Fallot in two cases, short first metacarpals and thumbs, and hypoplastic radius and ulna in one patient. These features overlap those previously reported in two male siblings and suggest that this association of microcephaly-facio-cardio-skeletal defects could represent a unique autosomal or X-linked recessive disorder.\n",
      "Here we report on 2 mentally retarded sisters with clinical signs and symptoms not seen in a previously delineated MCA/MR syndrome, i.e., normal pre- and perinatal history, severe mental retardation with severe delay in psychomotor development and without development of primary motor abilities and speech, characteristic face with maxillary hypoplasia, large mouth with down-turned corners, short philtrum and everted lower lip, associated with a remarkable ectomorphic habitus.\n",
      "We report two Colombian siblings affected by overgrowth, intellectual disability and facial dysmorphism. Exome (via NGS) and Sanger sequencing revealed that biallelic sequence variants in a novel gene (HERC1) might be related to the disease pathogenesis.

      "BACKGROUND:Syringomyelia is an uncommon disease of the spinal cord, occurring sporadically. However, rare familial cases with autosomal dominant or recessive inheritance patterns are reported and their incidence quoted as approximately 2%. Only one previous report originated from the United States. METHODS:We present a brother and sister with syringomyelia and associated Chiari type I malformation; both patients responded to surgical treatment. We review the world literature and briefly discuss pathogenetic theories of syringomyelia as well as the relevance of the histocompatibility leukocyte antigen profile. RESULTS:Both genetic and environmental factors appear to be involved in familial syringomyelia. CONCLUSION:We recommend that close relatives of patients affected with familial syringomyelia undergo routine neurologic and radiologic surveys.\n",
      "We have seen a Yemenite sister and brother with cutaneous hypomelanotic and pigmented spots and patches, microcornea, coloboma, severe hearing loss and normal karyotypes. Histopathological examinations of the skin showed absent melanocytes in the depigmented areas; in the normal and hyperpigmented skin there was abundant melanotic pigment. Similar patients have not been described previously, but there are corresponding mutations in mice and rats.\n",
      "We report on two brothers with ossification anomalies of membranous and cranial bones, remodeling defect of long bones leading to dense, overtubulated, narrow diaphyses, metaphyseal flare, periostal hyperosotosis that increased during the first months of life, thoracic dystrophy and severe hypotonia. One boy had hypospadias and cleft palate. Follow-up of the surviving boy documented progressive osteopenia, slow healing of the periostal anomalies, liver angiomatosis, mental and motor delay, thoracic deformity, delay in tooth eruption, and progressive microcephaly with enlargement of the cerebral ventricles. This disorder shares some traits with osteocraniostenosis, but lacks the cranial deformity and acromelic micromelia of the latter, in which periostal anomalies are not described. The syndrome reported here may represent a milder form of osteocraniostenosis, or a new entity belonging to the same \"family.\" Genealogical data are consistent with AR or XLR inheritance. No mutations were found in the coding sequence of filamin A.\n",
      "We describe a syndrome identified in three consanguineous families who had two and probably four common ancestors five generations ago. The syndrome is characterized by profound dysfunction of the central nervous system, silver-leaden colored hair, abnormal melanosomes and melanocytes, and abnormal inclusion bodies in fibroblasts, bone marrow histiocytes and lymphocytes which appear to represent abnormal lysosomal bodies. Because of the biochemical relationships between melanin-melanosomes and neuromelanin, we think that all the manifestations of the condition are related to and represent pleiotropic effects of a newly identified gene in man in its homozygous state. Biochemical reactions of the cells of these patients indicate presence of tyrosinase in the melanosomes.and show that the substance accumulated in cultured fibroblasts and in the bone marrow histiocytes is a PAS and Oil-red-O positive material but is Oil-red-O negative after extraction; it has the typical reactions of melanin withe the Masson and Fontana stain, but cannot be considered typical melanin, since without stain it is colorless. The ultrastructural studies showed round granules with variable matrix, similar in fibroblast and bone marrow, and with variable intensity of reaction to osmium. This mutation principally affects the neuroectoderm, but also the mesoderm.\n",
      "Griscelli syndrome (GS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by partial albinism. Three different types are caused by defects in three different genes. Patients with GS type 1 have primary central nervous system dysfunction, type 2 patients commonly develop hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, and type 3 patients have only partial albinism. While hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is life saving in type 2, no specific therapy is required for types 1 and 3. Patients with GS types 1 and 3 are very rare. To date, only 2 patients with type 3 and about 20 GS type 1 patients, including the patients described as Elejalde syndrome, have been reported. The neurological deficits in Elejalde syndrome were reported as severe neurodevelopmental delay, seizures, hypotonia, and ophthalmological problems including nystagmus, diplopia, and retinal problems. However, none of these patients' clinical progresses were reported. We described here our two new type 1 and two type 3 patients along with the progresses of our previously diagnosed patients with GS types 1 and 3. Our previous patient with GS type I is alive at age 21 without any other problems except severe mental and motor retardation, patients with type 3 are healthy at ages 21 and 24 years having only pigmentary dilution; silvery gray hair, eye brows, and eyelashes. Since prognosis, treatment options, and genetic counseling markedly differ among different types, molecular characterization has utmost importance in GS.\n",
      "We present two siblings from unrelated parents presenting with intrauterine growth retardation, a congenital heart defect, postaxial polydactyly, a brain malformation (ectopic neuropituitary gland associated with a hypoplastic adenopituitary in one of them, and a hypoplastic cerebellum and vermis in the other), abnormal hair with temporal balding, a striking facial dysmorphism and, at least in the child who survived, postnatal growth retardation and severe developmental delay. This probably represents a novel syndrome.\n",
      "A syndrome which consists of growth retardation, mental deficiency, preaxial polydactyly and colobomatous anomalies was observed in two sibs and might have been transmitted by an autosomal recessive mutation. In the brother there is an incomplete coloboma of the optic nerve head, in the sister a coloboma of the iris, optic nerve head, choroid, and retina. Polydactyly is unilateral. Similar observations have been quoted but no identical case seems to have been published.\n",
      "Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) are a group of metabolic diseases resulting from defects in glycan synthesis or processing. The number of subgroups and their phenotypic spectrums continue to expand with most related to deficiencies of N-glycosylation. ALG9-CDG (previously CDG-IL) is the result of a mutation in ALG9. This gene encodes the enzyme alpha-1,2-mannosyltransferase. To date, a total of 10 patients from 6 different families have been reported with one of four ALG9 mutations. Seven of these patients had a similar phenotype with failure to thrive, dysmorphic features, seizures, hepatic and/or renal cysts; the other three patients died in utero from a lethal skeletal dysplasia. This report describes an additional patient with ALG9-CDG who has a milder phenotype. This patient is a term female born to Caucasian, Canadian, non-consanguineous parents of Scottish decent. Prenatally, dysmorphic features, numerous renal cysts and minor cardiac malformations were detected. Post-natally, dysmorphic features included shallow orbits, micrognathia, hypoplastic nipples, talipes equinovarus, lipodystrophy and cutis marmorata. She developed failure to thrive and seizures. The metabolic work-up included analysis of a transferrin isoelectric focusing, which showed a type 1 pattern. This was confirmed by glycan profiling, which identified ahomozygous mutation in ALG9, c.860A¬†>¬†G (p.Tyr287Cys) (NM_1234567890). This had been previously published as a pathogenic mutation in two Canadian patients. Our goal is to contribute to the growing body of knowledge for this disorder by describing the phenotypic spectrum and providing further insight on prognosis.\n",
      "Since the initial description in 2010 of anoctamin 5 deficiency as a cause of muscular dystrophy, a handful of papers have described this disease in cases of mixed populations. We report the first large regional study and present data on new aspects of prevalence, muscular and cardiac phenotypic characteristics, and muscle protein expression. All patients in our neuromuscular unit with genetically unclassified, recessive limb girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD2), Miyoshi-type distal myopathy (MMD) or persistent asymptomatic hyperCK-emia (PACK) were assessed for mutations in the ANO5 gene. Genetically confirmed patients were evaluated with muscular and cardiopulmonary examination. Among 40 unclassified patients (28 LGMD2, 5 MMD, 7 PACK), 20 were homozygous or compound heterozygous for ANO5 mutations, (13 LGMD2, 5 MMD, 2 PACK). Prevalence of ANO5 deficiency in Denmark was estimated at 1:100.000 and ANO5 mutations caused 11 % of our total cohort of LGMD2 cases making it the second most common LGMD2 etiology in Denmark. Eight patients complained of dysphagia and 3 dated symptoms of onset in childhood. Cardiac examinations revealed increased frequency of premature ventricular contractions. Four novel putative pathogenic mutations were discovered. Total prevalence and distribution of phenotypes of ANO5 disease in a representative regional cohort are described for the first time. A high prevalence of ANO5 deficiency was found among patients with unclassified LGMD2 (46 %) and MMD (100 %). The high incidence of reported dysphagia is a new phenotypic feature not previously reported, and cardiac investigations revealed that ANO5-patients may have an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmia.\n",
      "NSD1 point mutations, submicroscopic deletions and intragenic deletions are the major cause of Sotos syndrome, characterized by pre-postnatal generalized overgrowth with advanced bone age, learning disability, seizures, distinctive facial phenotype. Reverse clinical phenotype due to 5q35 microduplication encompassing NSD1 gene has been reported so far in 27 cases presenting with delayed bone age, microcephaly, failure to thrive and seizures in some cases, further supporting a gene dosage effect of NSD1 on growth regulation and neurological functions. Here we depict the clinical presentation of three new cases with 5q35 microduplication outlining a novel syndrome characterized by microcephaly, short stature, developmental delay and in some cases delayed bone maturation, without any typical facial or osseous anomalies.\n",
      "Mutations in the PIGN gene involved in the glycosylphoshatidylinositol (GPI) anchor biosynthesis pathway cause Multiple Congenital Anomalies-Hypotonia-Seizures syndrome 1 (MCAHS1). The syndrome manifests developmental delay, hypotonia, and epilepsy, combined with multiple congenital anomalies. We report on the identification of a homozygous novel c.755A>T (p.D252V) deleterious mutation in a patient with Israeli-Arab origin with MCAHS1. The mutated PIGN caused a significant decrease of the overall GPI-anchored proteins and CD24 expression. Our results, strongly support previously published data, that partial depletion of GPI-anchored proteins is sufficient to cause severe phenotypic expression.\n",
      "Four sibs with varying degrees of caudal dysgenesis are described. Case 1 showed aberrant umbilical cord vasculature with a single umbilical artery near the placental insertion. Cases 2 and 3 showed full sirenomelia, one with a complex congenital heart defect. Case 4 had an imperforate anus and an excessively long umbilical cord. The father's half-sib had an imperforate anus, rectovaginal fistula and genitourinary anomalies. A dominant gene with reduced penetrance is likely.\n",
      "We describe a 10-year-old girl with features of a frontonasal dysplasia and a right-sided Poland anomaly. As there has been one previous case report of pectoral muscle hypoplasia in association with craniofrontonasal dysplasia, the relationship between these two conditions is discussed.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Since the advent of array-CGH, numerous new microdeletional syndromes have been delineated while others remain to be described. Although 3q29 subtelomeric deletion is a well-described syndrome, there is no report on 3q interstitial deletions. METHODS: We report for the first time seven patients with interstitial deletions at the 3q27.3q28 locus gathered through the Decipher database, and suggest this locus as a new microdeletional syndrome. RESULTS: The patients shared a recognisable facial dysmorphism and marfanoid habitus, associated with psychosis and mild to severe intellectual disability (ID). Most of the patients had no delay in gross psychomotor acquisition, but had severe impaired communicative and adaptive skills. Two small regions of overlap were defined. The first one, located on the 3q27.3 locus and common to all patients, was associated with psychotic troubles and mood disorders as well as recognisable facial dysmorphism. This region comprised several candidate genes including SST, considered a candidate for the neuropsychiatric findings because of its implication in interneuronal migration and differentiation processes. A familial case with a smaller deletion allowed us to define a second region of overlap at the 3q27.3q28 locus for marfanoid habitus and severe ID. Indeed, the common morphological findings in the first four patients included skeletal features from the marfanoid spectrum: scoliosis (4/4), long and thin habitus with leanness (average Body Mass Index of 15 (18.5<N<25)) (4/4), arachnodactyly (3/4) and pectus excavatum (2/4)). This phenotype could be explained by the deletion of the AHSG gene, which encodes a secreted protein implicated in bone maturation and the TGFb signalling pathway. CONCLUSIONS: We report on a new microdeletional syndrome that associates with a recognisable facial dysmorphism and marfanoid habitus including scoliosis, neuropsychiatric disorders of the psychotic spectrum and moderate to severe ID.\n",
      "We report on 3 sibs (2 boys and a girl) with a previously apparently unrecognized combination of anonychia congenita and microcephaly with normal intelligence. The shape of the head is normal. Other anomalies include clinodactyly of the fifth fingers and bilateral single transverse palmar creases. Skeletal survey was normal in the 2 older children. These children and their first-cousin Iranian parents have widely spaced teeth. The children's first cousin also has total anonychia congenita and apparently small head. We review anonychia congenita, and conclude that the presently reported family with a \"new autosomal-recessive disorder\" provides further evidence of the heterogeneity of this condition.\n",
      "We report on two Japanese brothers with hereditary deficiency in gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase. The propositus was 48 years old when he first visited our medical center and had a 51-year-old brother. The brothers were both tall and slender and had long limbs; the younger was diagnosed as having Marfan syndrome. Both patients both showed a tendency to retarded mental development. gamma-Glutamyltranspeptidase activity was below the detection limit of 1 IU/L in both patients. Glutathionaemia and glutathionuria were evident in both brothers. The analyses of sulphydryl compounds in the plasma (and serum for certain test items) and urine indicated high concentrations of glutathione, gamma-glutamylcysteine, cysteine and cysteinylglycine. Urine amino acid analysis on an automatic analyser showed a slightly increased excretion of cystine and a large peak in the citrulline position due, at least in part, to thio-compounds.\n",
      "Shprintzen and Goldberg [1979] described a new autosomal dominant syndrome characterized by omphalocele, scoliosis, pharyngeal and laryngeal hypoplasia, mild dysmorphic face, and learning disabilities. This condition was described in a father and three daughters, one of whom died in infancy, probably of airway narrowing. Here, we report on a second observation of this syndrome in a 6-year-old patient. In our case, omphalocele, imperforate anus, and feeding impairment were the main clinical problems in the neonatal period. Scoliosis appeared during the fourth year of age. The facial appearance is similar to the original patients and additional clinical findings are described which expand the phenotypic spectrum.\n",
      "Two brothers are described with a similar physical appearance characterised by minor periorbital anomalies, malar flatness, a maxillary overbite, retrognathia, sloping shoulders, joint hyperextensibility, and minor radiological anomalies. In addition, they had a slowly progressing night blindness, myopia, and extinguished electroretinograms. The mother had mild expression of some of the physical anomalies and a decreased electroretinogram response to red light. We have been unable to find any report of similarly affected children. The possible modes of inheritance are discussed.\n",
      "The SH2B adaptor protein 3 (SH2B3) gene encodes a negative regulator of cytokine signaling with a critical role in the homeostasis of hematopoietic stem cells and lymphoid progenitors. Here, we report the identification of germline homozygous SH2B3 mutations in 2 siblings affected with developmental delay and autoimmunity, one in whom B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) developed. Mechanistically, loss of SH2B3 increases Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription signaling, promotes lymphoid cell proliferation, and accelerates leukemia development in a mouse model of NOTCH1-induced ALL. Moreover, extended mutation analysis showed homozygous somatic mutations in SH2B3 in 2 of 167 ALLs analyzed. Overall, these results demonstrate a Knudson tumor suppressor role for SH2B3 in the pathogenesis of ALL and highlight a possible link between genetic predisposition factors in the pathogenesis of autoimmunity and leukemogenesis.\n",
      "We report two brothers of Chinese origin who have an apparently unique syndrome of cleft lip/palate, profound sensorineural deafness, and a sacral lipoma. Additional findings which were not common to both were aberrant digital appendages on the heel and thigh of one boy and an anterior sacral meningocele and dislocated hip in the other. Intelligence is normal in both. Both boys suffer from functional constipation but biopsy studies showed no evidence of Hirschsprung's disease. The parents, who are normal, are not related. Inheritance is probably autosomal or X linked recessive. A possible link with the disorganisation mouse mutant is discussed.\n",
      "Inflammasomes are innate immune sensors that respond to pathogen- and damage-associated signals with caspase-1 activation, interleukin (IL)-1Œ≤ and IL-18 secretion, and macrophage pyroptosis. The discovery that dominant gain-of-function mutations in NLRP3 cause the cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS) and trigger spontaneous inflammasome activation and IL-1Œ≤ oversecretion led to successful treatment with IL-1-blocking agents. Herein we report a de novo missense mutation (c.1009A > T, encoding p.Thr337Ser) affecting the nucleotide-binding domain of the inflammasome component NLRC4 that causes early-onset recurrent fever flares and macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). Functional analyses demonstrated spontaneous inflammasome formation and production of the inflammasome-dependent cytokines IL-1Œ≤ and IL-18, with the latter exceeding the levels seen in CAPS. The NLRC4 mutation caused constitutive caspase-1 cleavage in cells transduced with mutant NLRC4 and increased production of IL-18 in both patient-derived and mutant NLRC4-transduced macrophages. Thus, we describe a new monoallelic inflammasome defect that expands the monogenic autoinflammatory disease spectrum to include MAS and suggests new targets for therapy.\n",
      "We report a clinicopathological observation concerning a man and his son affected by the same disease. The main cutaneous lesions included poikiloderma congenitale and generalized alopecia respecting the pubic area. These anomalies were associated with cleft palate and Robin sequence in the boy. The main histological changes consisted in a marked atrophy of hairs with persistence of sebaceous glands. In sun-exposed areas, we found colloid bodies, melanophages and hyperplasia of the elastic tissue network. Those features resembled those of the Rothmund-Thomson syndrome, but the phenotype and the apparent dominant mode of inheritance exclude this possibility. A new genodermatosis, related with, but distinct from the Rothmund-Thomson syndrome is suspected, for which the acronym PARC syndrome is proposed.\n",
      "We report on a 41-year-old woman of normal intelligence with a complicated past medical history including unilateral profound hearing loss, unilateral Axenfeld-Rieger anomaly, and leukoencephalopathy. She was referred to an adult neurology clinic because of a previous diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, which was non-responsive to multiple medications. Due to her complicated past medical history, the medical genetics service was consulted. She was found to have a chromosome 6p25.3-6p25.2 deletion on SNP array. This report highlights chromosome 6p subtelomeric deletions as a possible underlying cause for periventricular white matter abnormalities in an adult. It emphasizes the importance of genetic testing in an adult with leukoencephalopathy and congenital anomalies.\n",
      "A 22-year-old female showing hyperpigmented spots and mild palmoplantar hyperkeratosis as leading features is presented. The diagnosis of Hyperkeratosis-hyperpigmentation syndrome, previously described by our group as an autosomal dominant trait, was unmistakable, thus permitting the corroboration of this genodermatosis.\n",
      "Oculodentodigital dysplasia (ODDD) (MIM 164200) is a rare autosomal dominant inherited disorder affecting the development of the face, eyes, limbs and dentition. Neurological complications are thought to be occasional manifestations of the disorder. This report illustrates the neurological manifestations by a pedigree of two ODDD patients with spastic paraparesis, cerebral white matter hyperintensity and basal ganglia hypointensity. A systematic review of the English, French, German and Italian literature on ODDD is also provided to summarize the neurological manifestations of the disorder. 243 previously described ODDD cases presented a spectrum of neurological manifestation including spasticity (25), subcortical white matter lesions (9) and basal ganglia changes (6) on MRI. Additional findings consisted of gaze palsy and squinting (28), bladder and bowel disturbances (21), visual loss (20) and blindness (4), hearing loss (15), ataxia (11), nystagmus (9), muscle weakness (5) and paresthesias (3). Neurological manifestations, including spasticity associated with MRI changes, are an underrecognized feature in the ODDD phenotype. A clinical guide to the neurological manifestations of ODDD may assist in the assessment of patients with this condition.\n",
      "Somatic truncating variants of the WAC gene have been observed in patients with hematologic malignancies. Furthermore, de novo heterozygous constitutional pathogenic variants of WAC have recently been shown to cause a syndromic form of intellectual disability, DeSanto-Shinawi syndrome. It is unknown whether the constitutional pathogenic variants observed in the intellectual disability syndrome overlap with the somatic pathogenic variants observed in hematologic abnormalities. Herein, we report three patients with constitutional truncating variants of WAC in an attempt to address the above questions. All three of the patients had mild to moderate intellectual disability and dysmorphic features. We then reviewed the phenotypic features of 19 patients with DeSanto-Shinawi syndrome, including the three currently reported ones: eight and seven patients showed a bulbous nasal tip and short fingers, respectively. As for the pathogenetic mechanism, we demonstrated that the expression level of the mRNA derived from the wildtype allele was higher than that derived from the mutated allele, demonstrating nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. This observation makes a haploinsufficiency mechanism likely. Reviews of the constitutional and somatic pathogenic variants observed in patients with hematologic malignancies showed a significant overlap of the two. To date, no patients with DeSanto-Shinawi syndrome have been reported to have developed hematologic abnormalities, except for one of the three patients reported herein who developed leukopenia and thrombocytopenia at the age of 19 years. Larger data sets are required to determine hematologic prognosis of patients with constitutional WAC variants.\n",
      "We report on a mother and her two children with an autosomal dominant cataract syndrome with associated aberrant oral frenula, growth retardation, and specific facial appearance. Their phenotype differs from that of other reported cataract syndromes, and we conclude that this is a previously undescribed entity.\n",
      "Two brothers were found to have an unusual congenital syndrome of lymphedema, pulmonary lymphagiectasia, hypoparthyroidism, hereditary nephropathy, prolapsing mitral valve, and other somatic abnormalities.\n",
      "Two sisters born to consanguineous parents had a syndrome of short stature, acrocephaly, hypertelorism, proptosis, ptosis, down-slanting palpebral fissures, high nose bridge and anteverted nares, short philtrum, cleft palate, micrognathia, abnormal external ears, preauricular pits, sensorineural and conductive deafness, proximally placed first toes and digitalized thumbs, bulbous digits, metatarsus adductus, and pectus excavatum. Radiological abnormalities included craniosynostosis, increased mandibular angle and antegonial notching of mandible; hypoplastic first metacarpals and metatarsals; hypoplastic distal phalanges; partial duplication of the distal phalanx of the thumb; malformed malleus and incus; tall lumbar vertebrae, increased interpedicular distance, and posterior scalloping; flared iliac wings, narrow supraacetabular regions, acetabular \"dysplasia,\" and coxa valga. Autosomal recessive inheritance is suggested.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Zinc (Zn) is an essential trace element and it is abundant in connective tissues, however biological roles of Zn and its transporters in those tissues and cells remain unknown. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we report that mice deficient in Zn transporter Slc39a13/Zip13 show changes in bone, teeth and connective tissue reminiscent of the clinical spectrum of human Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS). The Slc39a13 knockout (Slc39a13-KO) mice show defects in the maturation of osteoblasts, chondrocytes, odontoblasts, and fibroblasts. In the corresponding tissues and cells, impairment in bone morphogenic protein (BMP) and TGF-beta signaling were observed. Homozygosity for a SLC39A13 loss of function mutation was detected in sibs affected by a unique variant of EDS that recapitulates the phenotype observed in Slc39a13-KO mice. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Hence, our results reveal a crucial role of SLC39A13/ZIP13 in connective tissue development at least in part due to its involvement in the BMP/TGF-beta signaling pathways. The Slc39a13-KO mouse represents a novel animal model linking zinc metabolism, BMP/TGF-beta signaling and connective tissue dysfunction.\n",
      "Thirty cases of the Bjornstad syndrome (sensorineural deafness and pili torti) have been reported between 1965, when it was first described, and 1999. Both autosomal dominant and recessive inheritance patterns appear in the literature. We describe a family in which 3 members have the combination of pili torti and varying degrees of hearing loss inherited in an apparently autosomal dominant fashion. Hairs from the father and son of this family showed the classic features of pili torti under scanning electron microscopy.\n",
      "Numerous human disorders, including Cockayne syndrome, UV-sensitive syndrome, xeroderma pigmentosum, and trichothiodystrophy, result from the mutation of genes encoding molecules important for nucleotide excision repair. Here, we describe a syndrome in which the cardinal clinical features include short stature, hearing loss, premature aging, telangiectasia, neurodegeneration, and photosensitivity, resulting from a homozygous missense (p.Ser228Ile) sequence alteration of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). PCNA is a highly conserved sliding clamp protein essential for DNA replication and repair. Due to this fundamental role, mutations in PCNA that profoundly impair protein function would be incompatible with life. Interestingly, while the p.Ser228Ile alteration appeared to have no effect on protein levels or DNA replication, patient cells exhibited marked abnormalities in response to UV irradiation, displaying substantial reductions in both UV survival and RNA synthesis recovery. The p.Ser228Ile change also profoundly altered PCNA's interaction with Flap endonuclease 1 and DNA Ligase 1, DNA metabolism enzymes. Together, our findings detail a mutation of PCNA in humans associated with a neurodegenerative phenotype, displaying clinical and molecular features common to other DNA repair disorders, which we showed to be attributable to a hypomorphic amino acid alteration.\n",
      "Trisomy 12 mosaicism is a rare condition. Herein, we report a patient with mosaic trisomy 12 who was conceived by in vitro fertilization. She presented with mild dysmorphic features at birth, including down-slanting palpebral fissures, a depressed and creased nasal bridge, and mild rhizomelic shortening of the limbs. She had age-appropriate development at 6 months of age, but displayed slightly more dysmorphic features than at birth. Chromosome analysis on peripheral blood revealed a normal female karyotype in 50 metaphases. A concurrent genomic microarray analysis showed trisomy 12 in about 25% of the specimen, which was also confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis with the CEP12 probe. Our findings further delineate the clinical features in trisomy 12 mosaicism in liveborns and demonstrate the utility of genomic microarray analysis in identification of mosaic aneuploidies.\n",
      "Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (OMIM 270400) (SLOS) is caused by inherited enzymatic deficiency of 3beta-hydroxysterol-Delta7-reductase (7-dehydrocholesterol-Delta7-reductase, DHCR7). SLOS is diagnosed clinically by the demonstration of elevated levels of 7-dehydrocholesterol (7DHC) in body fluids or tissues. SLOS is associated with mental retardation of variable degree and severe behavior abnormalities. The physical abnormalities range from minor facial anomalies to lethal malformations of the central nervous system, heart, kidneys, and other organs. The exact incidence of SLOS is not known. Although there exist estimates of the incidence of SLOS ranging from 1 in 20,000 to 1 in 60,000, no prospective studies of the incidence of SLOS, based on the clinical data and biochemical diagnosis of SLOS, have been performed. Five unrelated cases of SLOS were diagnosed in Ontario during a 12-month period. The diagnoses were made based on the demonstration of elevated 7DHC in plasma or amniotic fluid. The birth rate for Ontario for that period was 132,000 births. The incidence of SLOS in Ontario was at least 1 in 26,500 pregnancies in 1999-2000. Given that 86% of the population of Ontario is of European origin, the incidence of SLOS in the Ontario population of European origin was at least 1 in 22,700. As infants with mild forms of SLOS born during this period may remain undiagnosed, these numbers likely are underestimates. This observation has implications for prenatal and newborn screening for this potentially treatable inherited disorder.\n",
      "Stratton and Parker [1989] described a 17-month-old boy with the previously unreported combination of growth hormone (GH) deficiency, Wormian bones, mild developmental delay, brachycamptodactyly, heart defects, kidney hypoplasia, imperforate anus, bilateral cryptorchidism, and facial anomalies. A similar case was later reported by Gabrielli et al. [1994], who suggested the existence of a \"Stratton-Parker syndrome.\" Here, we describe a boy with isolated GH deficiency, body asymmetry, and brachycamptodactyly. At birth, complete anorectal agenesis and cryptorchidism were detected, which required surgical treatment. Radiographic examination showed the presence of bilateral proximal radioulnar subluxation and Kirner anomaly. Brain MRI showed asymmetry of the posterior horns of the lateral ventricles and enlarged cisterna magna. Psychomotor development had been mildly delayed during the first years of life. Due to the unique association of GH deficiency with intestinal, genital, and limbs abnormalities, we believe that our patient may represent a further case of Stratton-Parker syndrome. All patients reported, till date, are sporadic males born to healthy nonconsanguineous parents. X-linked recessive inheritance is a possibility to consider.\n",
      "Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4H (CMT4H) is an autosomal recessive demyelinating neuropathy. It presents as infancy or early childhood-onset neuropathy associated with FGD4 mutations. Clinically it causes predominantly distal muscle weakness. On nerve biopsy examination, myelin outfoldings are seen. The previous case reports have been from regions bordering the Mediterranean, as well as a family from Northern Ireland. This paper presents the detailed clinical course of the first reported case of CMT4H in a Japanese woman. The patient showed mild weakness without scoliosis and a severe sensory disturbance; her functional impairment was less severe than the previously published cases. In addition, a novel homozygous FGD4 c.837-1G>A mutation was identified in this patient.\n",

      "BACKGROUND:The emerging 3q13.31 microdeletion syndrome appears to encompass diverse neurodevelopmental conditions. However, the 3q13.31 deletion is rare and few adult cases have yet been reported. We examined a cohort with schizophrenia (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ459) and adult control subjects (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ26,826) using high-resolution microarray technology for deletions and duplications at the 3q13.31 locus. RESULTS:We report on the extended adult phenotype associated with a 3q13.31 microdeletion in a 41-year-old male proband with schizophrenia and a nonverbal learning disability. He was noted to have a speech impairment, delayed motor skills, and other features consistent with the 3q13.31 microdeletion syndrome. The 2.06¬†Mb deletion overlapped two microRNAs and seven RefSeq genes, including GAP43, LSAMP, DRD3, and ZBTB20. No overlapping 3q13.31 deletions or duplications were identified in control subjects. CONCLUSIONS:Later-onset conditions like schizophrenia are increasingly associated with rare copy number variations and associated genomic disorders like the 3q13.31 microdeletion syndrome. Detailed phenotype information across the lifespan facilitates genotype-phenotype correlations, accurate genetic counselling, and anticipatory care.\n",

      "Long-chain l-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCHAD) deficiency has been included in the routine neonatal screening program by the German screening commission. As tandem mass spectrometry (TMS) does not discriminate between the different defects of the mitochondrial trifunctional protein (MTP) screening for isolated LCHAD deficiency includes the detection of long-chain 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase and complete MTP deficiencies as well. We identified 11 patients with abnormalities of the MTP out of 1.2 million newborns screened in our laboratory during the last 6 years. Treatment was started on the day the screening result was obtained (day 3 to day 9 of life). Seven of these newborns developed satisfactorily during an observation period of up to 64 months. They had isolated LCHAD deficiency, four of them caused by the typical mutation (1528 G>C), three others had no molecular genetic analysis done or were shown to have previously unknown mutations. Four children did not survive, two of them showing complete deficiency of MTP and two showing deficiency of long-chain 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase. We conclude that, despite the rarity of the disease, screening for MTP deficiencies is justified based on the following criteria: improved quality of life for patients with isolated LCHAD deficiency, absence of stigmatisation of babies showing mild variants without necessity of treatment, no significant increase of the total number of false positive screening results, no false negative results to our knowledge. Finally, extension of analysis to MTP deficiencies is achieved without additional costs for screening laboratories already using TMS.\n",
      "Our aim was to characterize HDL subspecies and fat-soluble vitamin levels in a kindred with familial apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) deficiency. Sequencing of the APOA1 gene revealed a nonsense mutation at codon -2, Q[-2]X, with two documented homozygotes, eight heterozygotes, and two normal subjects in the kindred. Homozygotes presented markedly decreased HDL cholesterol levels, undetectable plasma apoA-1, tuboeruptive and planar xanthomas, mild corneal arcus and opacification, and severe premature coronary artery disease. In both homozygotes, analysis of HDL particles by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed undetectable apoA-I, decreased amounts of small alpha-3 migrating apoA-II particles, and only modestly decreased normal amounts of slow alpha migrating apoA-IV- and apoE-containing HDL, while in the eight heterozygotes, there was loss of large alpha-1 HDL particles. There were no significant decreases in plasma fat-soluble vitamin levels noted in either homozygotes or heterozygotes compared with normal control subjects. Our data indicate that isolated apoA-I deficiency results in marked HDL deficiency with very low apoA-II alpha-3 HDL particles, modest reductions in the separate and distinct plasma apoA-IV and apoE HDL particles, tuboeruptive xanthomas, premature coronary atherosclerosis, and no evidence of fat malabsorption.\n",
      "Amorphic mutations in the recombination activating genes RAG1 and RAG2 have been reported to cause T- B- SCID, whereas hypomorphic mutations led to the expansion of a few autoimmune T cell clones responsible for the Omenn syndrome phenotype. We report here a novel clinical and immunological phenotype associated with recessive RAG1 hypomorphic mutations in 4 patients from 4 different families. The immunological phenotype consists of the oligoclonal expansion of TCR gammadelta T cells combined with TCR alphabeta T cell lymphopenia. The clinical phenotype consists of severe, disseminated CMV infection and autoimmune blood cell manifestations. Repertoire studies suggest that CMV infection, in the setting of this particular T cell immunodeficiency, may have driven the TCR gammadelta T cell clonal expansion. This observation extends the range of clinical and immunological phenotypes associated with RAG mutations, emphasizing the role of the genetic background and microbial environment in determining disease phenotype.\n",
      "A mother and her son are described with neonatal trigonocephaly, multiple suture synostosis; shallow orbits; unusual nose; deviation of the terminal phalanges of  fingers 1, 2, and 5; and broad toes which radiologically may show duplication of the terminal phalanx. Untreated, the condition leads to a disfiguring oxycephaly with hypotelorism. This appears to be the first documented instance of autosomal dominant trigonocephaly. The importance of the minor anomalies in its recognition and its good prognosis are emphasized.\n",
      "We report two sibs from a complexly consanguineous family with joint contractures, skeletal abnormalities, anterior segment anomalies of the eye and early lethality. The features of these sibs are similar to the features of the sibs reported by Al-Gazali et al. (Clin Dysmorphol 3: 238-244, 1994). This report confirms the identity of this new autosomal recessive syndrome.\n",
      "A brother and sister with mental retardation, malformations of the cerebellar vermis, characteristic 'metronome' eye movements, lingual hamartomas, and postaxial polydactyly are described. The clinical overlap with the OFD group of syndromes, in particular OFD III and OFD VI, and Joubert's syndrome is discussed. If OFD III syndrome is to be recognised as a distinct entity, these two cases represent the second and third cases reported.\n",
      "A family with dominant inheritance of a previously unreported syndrome of craniofacial dysplasia and cone-shaped physes of the hands and feet is described. Hydrocephalus and spinal cord compression at the craniocervical junction causes neurological complications and mimics cerebral palsy. Early diagnosis and treatment may prevent progression of neurological changes.\n",
      "We report heterozygous, loss-of-function SOX2 mutations in three unrelated individuals with Anophthalmia-Esophageal-Genital (AEG) syndrome. One previously reported case [Rogers, R.C. (1988) Unknown cases. Proceedings of the Greenwood Genetic Center. 7, 57.] has a 2.7 Mb deletion encompassing SOX2 and associated with a cryptic translocation t(3;7)(q28;p21.3). The deletion and translocation breakpoints on chromosome 3q are >8.6 Mb apart and both chromosome rearrangements have occurred de novo. Another published case [Petrackova et al. (2004) Association of oesophageal atresia, anophthalmia and renal duplex. Eur. J. Pediatr., 163, 333-334.] has a de novo nonsense mutation, Q55X. A previously unreported case with severe bilateral microphthalmia and oesophageal atresia has a de novo missense mutation, R74P, that alters a highly evolutionarily conserved residue within the high mobility group domain, which is critical for DNA-binding of SOX2. In a yeast one-hybrid assay, this mutation abolishes Sox2-induced activation of the chick delta-crystallin DC5 enhancer. Four other reported AEG syndrome cases were extensively screened and do not have detectable SOX2 mutations. Two of these cases have unilateral eye malformations. SOX2 mutations are known to cause severe bilateral eye malformations but this is the first report implicating loss of function mutations in this transcription factor in oesophageal malformations. SOX2 is expressed in the developing foregut in mouse and zebrafish embryos and an apparently normal pattern of expression is maintained in Shh-/- mouse embryos, suggesting either that Sox2 acts upstream of Shh or functions in a different pathway. Three-dimensional reconstructions of the major morphological events in the developing foregut and eye from Carnegie Stages 12 and 13 human embryos are presented and compared with the data from model organisms. SOX2, with NMYC and CHD7, is now the third transcriptional regulator known to be critical for normal oesophageal development in humans.\n",
      "Supernumerary nostril is a rare congenital anomaly that is classified under duplication of nose. Only 32 cases have been reported so far in the English literature. We attended to an adult female having supernumerary nostril. Surgical correction with minimum intervention was planned, keeping an option of open tip rhinoplasty as backup in case the patient needs it later. She was satisfied with the outcome in spite of having little asymmetry of her nostrils. This case is being reported here as an addition to the published list and the literature reviewed in this context.\n",
      "We report an inbred Omani family with four children in two sibships affected with a recessive type of multiple epiphyseal dysplasia, associated with macrocephaly frontal lobe atrophy on CT scan of the brain, lymphoedema and a distinctive facial appearance. We suggest that the constellation of abnormalities in these children represents a previously undescribed syndrome.\n",
      "Defects in dystroglycan post-translational modification result in congenital muscular dystrophy with or without additional eye and brain involvement, are referred to as secondary dystroglycanopathies and have been associated with mutations in 11 different genes encoding glycosyltransferases or associated proteins. However, only one patient with a mutation in the dystroglycan encoding gene DAG1 itself has been described before. We here report a homozygous novel DAG1 missense mutation c.2006G>T predicted to result in the amino acid substitution p.Cys669Phe in the Œ≤-subunit of dystroglycan in two Libyan siblings. The affected girls presented with a severe muscle-eye-brain disease-like phenotype with distinct additional findings of macrocephaly and extended bilateral multicystic white matter disease, overlapping with the cerebral findings in patients with megalencephalic leucoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts. This novel clinical phenotype observed in our patients further expands the clinical spectrum of dystroglycanopathies and suggests a role of DAG1 not only for dystroglycanopathies but also for some forms of more extensive and multicystic leucodystrophy.\n",
      "Here we describe a 12-year-old boy with finger and toe contractures, obesity, mental retardation, osteoporosis, and genital anomalies. This clinical picture was first described by Urban et al. [1979] and has been designated as \"Prader-Willi habitus, osteoporosis, and hand contractures.\" To our knowledge, our patient represents the second report of this condition.\n",
      "A 57-year-old man developed 3 days of left facial pain and swelling with left-sided hearing loss followed by a painful, unilateral, erythematous, and vesicular rash on the left anterior two-thirds of the tongue, external auditory canal, lip, and face typical of varicella-zoster virus reactivation (figure). Reactivation in the geniculate ganglion or facial nerve is uncommon and typically causes tongue and auricular lesions or facial palsy and was described by Hunt in 1907.(1) The patient received IV acyclovir and oral prednisone with rapid improvement in pain and resolution of lesions and improvement of hearing over 1 month.\n",
      "Stippled epiphyses occur in several monogenic, teratogenic, or aneuploidy syndromes. We describe two sibs with a provisionally unique chondrodysplasia punctata syndrome, who have, in addition to stippled epiphyses, minor facial anomalies, short stature, and ocular colobomata. Inheritance of this condition is likely autosomal recessive.\n",
      "The association of postaxial polydactyly type A and congenital scalp defect in a 15-year-old severely mentally retarded male confirms the previously reported suggestion that the combination of both anomalies represents a new distinct entity with autosomal dominant inheritance and variable expression.\n",
      "Pediatric-onset inflammatory myositis (IM) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are rare inflammatory diseases. Both result from the complex interaction of genetic and environmental factors. An increasing number of Mendelian conditions predisposing to the development of SLE have been recently identified. These include monogenic conditions, referred to as the type I interferonopathies, associated with a primary upregulation of type I interferon (IFN), a key cytokine in the pathogenesis of SLE and some cases of IM. Here, we report on a pediatric-onset inflammatory overlap phenotype in a 6-year-old girl who was shown to carry mosaic tetrasomy 9p. The patient presented with myositis overlapping with lupuslike features. Myositis was characterized by a proximal muscular weakness and HLA class I antigen myofiber overexpression on muscle biopsy. Lupus-like manifestations consisted of pericarditis, pleuritis, and positive antinuclear and anti-SSA (Sj√∂gren-syndrome A) antibodies. Complete remission was achieved with corticosteroids and mycophenolate mofetyl. Analysis of tetrasomy 9p showed mosaic tetrasomy in the 9p24.3q12 region, including the type I IFN cluster, and increased expression of IFN-stimulated genes. These data suggest that mosaic tetrasomy 9p can be associated with an upregulation of type I IFN signaling, predisposing to inflammatory myositis and lupus-like features. Thus, unexplained muscle or other organ involvement in patients carrying mosaic tetrasomy of the type IFN cluster of chromosome 9p should lead to the search for IM and/or lupuslike disease, and karyotype should be performed in patients with SLE or IM with mental retardation.\n",
      "A 6-week-old girl presented with cutis laxa, emphysema, heart anomalies and a diaphragmatic hernia. She died at 22 weeks. A recurrent ctb(7)(q31.3) was found and the laminin gene was suspected to be involved in the disease. Anti-human laminin antiserum showed that this protein was absent from the skin. This case, together with 17 other similar cases, could represent a new type of connective tissue disease.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Partial tetrasomy is mainly described as a cytogenetically visible rearrangement due to a supernumerary chromosome (i(12p), i(18p), inv dup(15)). Except for chromosome 15q11q13, intrachromosomal triplications are rare and so far not associated with a recognisable phenotype. METHODS AND RESULTS: This report describes two unrelated patients with a de novo non-recurrent submicroscopic interstitial triplication 11q24.1 detected with array comparative genomic hybridisation and confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridisation, molecular combing, and quantitative PCR. Microsatellite analysis suggested that a common mechanism of rearrangement might have been involved. These patients share remarkably similar clinical features including distinctive facial dysmorphisms, short stature with small extremities, keratoconus, overweight, and intellectual disability. The overlapping region of 1.8 Mb contains 11 RefSeq genes and three microRNA related genes. Interestingly, the overexpression of ASAM, a gene encoding an adipocyte specific adhesion molecule, may contribute to patients' obesity. Upregulation of BILD, known to mediate apoptosis in a caspase dependent manner, could deserve further investigation into the pathological mechanism of keratoconus. CONCLUSION: Isolated duplications of distal 11q region have been previously reported and associated with intellectual disability but without a consistent set of clinical features. These findings support the proposal that microtriplication 11q24.1 is a well recognisable clinical entity.\n",
      "We report on a mother and son with a similar syndrome of hypertelorism and telecanthus, epicanthal folds, downslanting palpebral fissures, ptosis, broad nasal bridge, malar hypoplasia, thin upper lip, smooth philtrum, and apparently low-set prominent ears. The son also has a hypoplastic shawl scrotum, cryptorchidism, and genu valgum. His language development was delayed at 18 months, but subsequently improved and was normal at age 3. The mother has the additional findings of marked cubitus valgus, hyper-extensible joints, dull normal intelligence and a bleeding diathesis. This pattern of multiple congenital anomalies may represent a new syndrome.\n",
      "Deficiencies of different proteins involved in copper metabolism have been reported to cause human diseases. Well-known syndromes, for example, are Menkes and Wilson diseases. Here we report a patient presenting with congenital cataract, severe muscular hypotonia, developmental delay, sensorineural hearing loss and cytochrome-c oxidase deficiency with repeatedly low copper and ceruloplasmin levels. These findings were suggestive of a copper metabolism disorder. In support of this, the patient's fibroblasts showed an increased copper uptake with normal retention. Detailed follow-up examinations were performed. Immunoblotting for several proteins including ATP7A (MNK or Menkes protein), ATP7B (Wilson protein) and SOD1 showed normal results, implying a copper metabolism defect other than Wilson or Menkes disease. Sequence analysis of ATOX1 and genes coding for proteins that are known to play a role in the mitochondrial copper metabolism (COI-III, SCO1, SCO2, COX11, COX17, COX19) revealed no mutations. Additional disease genes that have been associated with cytochrome-c oxidase deficiency were negative for mutations as well. As beneficial effects of copper histidinate supplementation have been reported in selected disorders of copper metabolism presenting with low serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels, we initiated a copper histidinate supplementation. Remarkable improvement of clinical symptoms was observed, with complete restoration of cytochrome-c oxidase activity in skeletal muscle.\n",
      "A Japanese brother and sister, the progeny of healthy parents, were born with thickened, wrinkled skin and died between the age of 2 and 3 years with a progressive cerebral disease characterized by generalized mental and motor impairment. Postmortem neuropathological studies disclosed a remarkable leukodystrophy in which multiple axonal spheroids were the outstanding feature. Ultrastructurally, the spheroids contained granules resembling ceroid-lipofuscin bodies. Similar granules were found in degenerating oligodendrocytes and in Schwann cells. The skin showed hypercellular and sclerotic features, suggestive of a genodermatosis. This combined neurologic and dermatologic syndrome, which, to our knowledge, has not hitherto been recognized, may well result from a genetically determined metabolic disorder, the nature of which still remains undisclosed.\n",
      "BACKGROUND:The laminin alpha 5 gene (LAMA5) plays a master role in the maintenance and function of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in mammalian tissues, which is critical in developmental patterning, stem cell niches, cancer and genetic diseases. Its mutations have never been reported in human disease so far. The aim of this study was to associate the first mutation in LAMA5 gene to a novel multisystem syndrome. METHODS:A detailed characterisation of a three-generation family, including clinical, biochemical, instrumental and morphological analysis, together with genetics and expression (WES and RNAseq) studies, was performed. RESULTS:The heterozygous LAMA5 mutation c.9418G>A (p.V3140M) was associated with skin anomalies, impaired scarring, night blindness, muscle weakness, osteoarthritis, joint and internal organs ligaments laxity, malabsorption syndrome and hypothyroidism. We demonstrated that the mutation alters the amount of LAMA5 peptides likely derived from protein cleavage and perturbs the activation of the epithelial-mesenchymal signalling, producing an unbalanced expression of Sonic hedgehog and GLI1, which are upregulated in cells from affected individuals, and of ECM proteins (COL1A1, MMP1 and MMP3), which are strongly inhibited. Studies carried out using human skin biopsies showed alteration of dermal papilla with a reduction of the germinative layer and an early arrest of hair follicle downgrowth. The knock-in mouse model, generated in our laboratory, shows similar changes in the tissues studied so far. CONCLUSIONS:This is the first report of a disease phenotype associated with LAMA5 mutation in humans.\n",
      "A family in which three male members had premature closure of the metopic suture with other suture involvement was studied. Each of the affected persons also had short stature and delayed development. The pattern of inheritance appeared to be X-linked recessive; however, the possibility of autosomal dominant inheritance with low expressivity in women could not be excluded. Findings in these patients did not fit the previously described syndromes of craniostenosis.\n",
      "A new syndrome with abnormalities along the first branchial arch and the milk list is described in a family of four affected generations. The characteristics of the syndrome are epibulbar lipodermoids, preauricular appendages and polythelia. The expressivity varies but all affected have supernumerary nipples and preauricular manifestations while visible epibulbar lipodermoids do not seem obligatory. The syndrome has a typical dominant pattern of heredity.\n",
      "Eosinophilic gastroenteritis is a rare disease of the gastrointestinal tract characterized by crampy abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, gastrointestinal bleeding, and weight loss associated with peripheral eosinophilia leading to eosinophilic infiltrates in stomach and intestine, usually in a patient with a prior history of atopy. In this article, we describe our encounter with a 59-year-old female presenting with severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and weight loss with an extensive evaluation including an upper endoscopy with biopsies resulting in a diagnosis of eosinophilic gastroenteritis. The patient was eventually treated with oral prednisone for three weeks with complete resolution of her symptoms.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Atypical Meigs' syndrome has been observed in patients with dermoid tumors, struma ovarii, uterine leiomyomata and other benign pelvic tumors except for ovarian fibromas. Meigs' and atypical Meigs' syndrome present management decisions complicated by a high index of suspicion for malignancy. CASE: A 43-year-old woman, gravida 1, para 1, with ascites; a pleural effusion; radiologic evidence of enlarged, cystic adnexa; and a normal CA-125 level was found to have cortical stromal hyperplasia on bilateral ovarian pathologic evaluation. CONCLUSION: This is the first case of cortical stromal hyperplasia presenting with bilateral involvement of small ovaries, ascites and a pleural effusion. Meigs' syndrome and its variants develop with clinical pictures suggestive of malignancy. Thorough evaluation and individualized treatment are necessary.\n",
      "Enchondromas are common intraosseous usually benign cartilaginous tumors that develop in close proximity to growth plate cartilage. Genochondromatosis is a familial skeletal condition with autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. Genochondromatosis type I is a skeletal disorder characterized by symmetrical chondromatosis with characteristic localization: clavicle, upper end of humerus, and lower end of femur. The condition shows a benign course and is clearly different from metachondromatosis, generalized enchondromatosis, and spondyloenchondrodysplasia. In contrast, genochondromatosis type II is characterized by normal clavicles, but metaphyseal involvement of the hands, feet, knees, and wrists. To date, one family has been described with two affected individuals and possibly a second one with seven affected individuals. We report here on a boy with radiographic features of genochondromatosis type II. This report confirms that this disorder represents a separate clinical entity distinguishable for genochondromatosis type I. In addition, this report confirms the benign course of this rare disorder and will help accurate genetic counseling.\n",
      "Grange syndrome is a disorder characterized by arterial occlusive disease, hypertension, congenital cardiac defects, bone fragility, brachysyndactyly, and learning disabilities. It was first described in four members of the same family and in two sporadic cases thereafter, suggesting the possibility of various patterns of inheritance. We report on the case of an 18-year-old female presenting with subarachnoid hemorrhage due to the rupture of a basilar artery aneurysm, and with distinctive systemic features including extensive vasculopathy, facial dysmorphisms and brachysyndactyly, consistent with the diagnosis of Grange syndrome. Although rare and not fully characterized, Grange syndrome should be included in the differential diagnosis of stroke at young age.\n",
      "Two sibs with a similar pattern of dysmorphic facial features and multiple structural abnormalities are reported. Both had a normal karyotype. The parents are first cousins and neither shows any stigmata of the disorder. In view of the consanguinity and pattern of malformations, autosomal recessive inheritance seems likely.\n",
      "X-linked sideroblastic anemia and ataxia (XLSA-A) is a rare cause of early onset ataxia, which may be overlooked due to the usually mild asymptomatic anemia. The genetic defect has been identified as a mutation in the ABCB7 gene at Xq12-q13. The gene encodes a mitochondrial ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter protein involved in iron homeostasis. Until now only three families have been reported, each with a distinct missense mutation in this gene. We describe a fourth family with XLSA-A and a novel mutation in the ABCB7 gene.\n",
      "We report on 2 sibs with cardiac and renal abnormalities. The first had hypoplastic left heart sequence and renal hypoplasia; the second had a complex congenital heart defect, renal agenesis, and cleft lip and palate. We suggest that these cases represent the first familial examples of the Holzgreve syndrome. As such, they demonstrate the phenotypic variability seen in sibs, and may serve to further delineate the syndrome.\n",
      "We report two patients with severe combined immunodeficiency and short stature/short limb skeletal dysplasia. Case 1 presented at birth with rhizomelic shortening of the extremities and bowing of the femora. She developed clinical signs of severe combined immunodeficiency at 13 months and died at 21 months. Case 2 had severe prenatal shortening and bowing of the extremities and a small, malformed chest. Symptoms of severe combined immunodeficiency and severe failure to thrive developed soon after birth and she died at 5 months. The diagnosis of severe combined immunodeficiency in our patients was based on their clinical course and necropsy findings, supported in case 1 by the results of immune function tests. The results of investigation of immune function (immunoglobulins, lymphocyte subpopulations, lymphocyte function) are very variable in this syndrome as in other variants of severe combined immunodeficiency. Bone histopathology in both patients showed grossly irregular costochondral junctions, but normal transition of proliferating to hypertrophic chondrocytes. These cases belong to early lethal type 1 short limb skeletal dysplasia with severe combined immunodeficiency. Review of previously published cases with severe combined immunodeficiency and well documented skeletal findings show eight patients with prenatal onset of bowing and shortening of the extremities and metaphyseal abnormalities. These include two sib pairs concordant for the skeletal changes. In these cases, adenosine deaminase levels were not reported. An additional four published cases with associated adenosine deaminase deficiency had only mild metaphyseal abnormalities, but subsequently showed no linear growth.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n",
      "Ring chromosome 15 [r(15)] is an uncommon finding with less than 50 patients reported. Precise genotype-phenotype correlations are problematic because of the difficulties in determining the extent of euchromatic loss, the level of mosaicism, and the influence of the timing of ascertainment. We report two discordant examples of r(15) patients. In the first case, prenatal diagnosis of a de novo r(15) was made during the second trimester: mos 46,XX,r(15)(p11.2q26)[32]/45,XX,-15[13]/47,XX,r(15)(p11.2q26)x2[3]/46,XX,dic r(15)(p11.2q26p11.2q26[1]/46,XX[2]. Postnatal follow-up revealed extremely small stature, heart defects, and developmental delay. Patient 2 was a 31-year-old short-statured female who was living independently: 46,XX,r(15)(p11q26). Both cases showed loss of the 15q subtelomeric region by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). To investigate the discordance in phenotypes between the two patients, we undertook array comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) analyses to more fully characterize the deletions associated with these otherwise structurally indistinguishable r(15) chromosomes from conventional cytogenetic analyses and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies. By array CGH, patient 1 showed deletion of multiple contiguous clones predicting an approximately 6 Mb deletion of distal 15q. In contrast, patient 2 showed loss of just the 15q subtelomeric clone and an interstitial clone by array CGH confirming that the severity of the phenotype correlated with the size of the deletion at the molecular level. These cases illustrate the utility of array CGH characterization for determining the size of the associated deletion in ring chromosomes and for facilitating phenotype-genotype correlations.\n",
      "17q12 deletions and duplications are two distinct, recurrent chromosomal aberrations usually diagnosed by chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA). The aberrations encompass the genes, HNF1B, LHX1, and ACACA, among others. We here describe a large national cohort of 12 phenotyped patients with 17q12 deletions and 26 phenotyped patients with 17q12 duplications. The total cohort includes 19 index patients and 19 family members. We also reviewed the literature in order to further improve the basis for the counseling. We emphasize that renal disease, learning disability, behavioral abnormalities, epilepsy, autism, schizophrenia, structural brain abnormalities, facial dysmorphism, and joint laxity are features seen in both the 17q12 deletion syndrome and the reciprocal 17q12 duplication syndrome; and we extend the list of features seen in both patient categories to include strabismus, esophageal defects, and duodenal atresia. Delayed language development, learning disability, kidney involvement, and eye dysmorphism and strabismus were the most consistently shared features among patients with 17q12 deletion. Patients with 17q12 duplications were characterized by an extremely wide phenotypic spectrum, including a variable degree of learning disabilities, delayed language development, delayed motor milestones, and a broad range of psychiatric and neurological features. This patient group also included adults achieving an academic degree. Assessing index patients and non-index patients separately, our observations illustrate that an overall milder disease burden is seen, in particular in patients with 17q12 duplications who are ascertained on the duplication rather than the phenotype. This evidence may be useful in prenatal counseling. ¬© 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Aplasia cutis cerebri with partial acrania is a rare anomaly that can involve the epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous tissues of the scalp with significant bone defect. METHODS: The authors present the first successful report of providing one-stage complete cover in a case of aplasia cutis cerebri with major skull defect by using local rotational flaps. Also presented is a review of literature. RESULTS: The newborn had a receding forehead and a large scalp defect from frontal to occipital bone measuring 10 x 8 cm2 involving full thickness of cranium centrally, thereby exposing the dura. Local rotation flaps were raised from the scalp to cover the 10- x 8-cm2 defect. The edges of the defect were showing granulation tissue with ingrowth of epithelium. Partial-thickness skin grafts were used to cover the raw area left at the nape of the neck after raising the rotation flaps. The child was discharged on the 19th postoperative day. CONCLUSIONS: Aplasia cutis cerebri with partial acrania, as in our case, has a high mortality rate secondary to infection or to hemorrhage from ulceration of the sagittal sinus. The successful outcome of our one-stage local rotational scalp flap technique provided complete cover to this major scalp defect. This technique will definitely improve the management of this complex disorder keeping the morbidity to the minimum.\n",
      "Three male sibs from consanguienous parents were found to have a strikingly similar pattern of multiple congenital anomalies. The main features were polyhydramnios; low birthweight; dwarfism; epicanthal folds; abnormal ears; microretrognathia; microstomia; microglossia; glossoptosis; webbed neck; severe cardiac defects; radial and ulnar hypoplasia; radial deviation of the hands; brachymetacarpalia; thumb hypoplasia; clinodactyly and hypoplasia of the 5th finger; simian creases; fibular and tibial hypoplasia; talipes varus with hypoplastic heels; wide gap between 1st and 2nd toes; and delayed bone age. Neonatal death occurred in the 3 babies by severe cardiac failure. Differential diagnosis permits one to conclude that this is a new type of faciocardiomelic dysplasia with a probable autosomal recessive inheritance.\n",
      "We investigated a small Dutch family with a bleeding diathesis, prolonged prothrombin, and activated partial thromboplastin times, in whom no classifying diagnosis was made. The 2 affected relatives had severely decreased in vitro thrombin generation, and levels of tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) were strongly increased. To identify the genetic cause of the bleeding diathesis, we performed whole exome sequencing analysis of all living relatives. We found a novel gain-of-function mutation in the F5 gene (c.C2588G), which leads to an aberrant splicing of F5 and ultimately to a short factor V protein (missing 623 amino acids from the B domain), which we called factor V Amsterdam. Factor V Amsterdam binds to TFPI, prolonging its half-life and concentration. This is the second report of an association between a shorter form of factor V and increased TFPI levels, resulting in severely reduced thrombin generation and a bleeding tendency.\n",
      "Marfan's syndrome has diverse manifestations that overlap with those seen in other connective tissue disorders. Visceral diverticula have been described only once in four adults with marfanoid features of recessive inheritance. Two siblings of a consanguineous marriage with marfanoid features, visceral diverticula, and diaphragmatic eventration are reported.\n",
      "Limb girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) is a heterogeneous group of genetic disorders leading to progressive muscle degeneration and often associated with cardiac complications. We present two adult siblings with childhood-onset of weakness progressing to a severe quadriparesis with the additional features of triangular tongues and biventricular cardiac dysfunction. Whole exome sequencing identified compound heterozygous missense mutations that are predicted to be pathogenic in LIMS2. Biopsy of skeletal muscle demonstrated disrupted immunostaining of LIMS2. This is the first report of mutations in LIMS2 and resulting disruption of the integrin linked kinase (ILK)-LIMS-parvin complex associated with LGMD.\n",
      "Genome-wide high-resolution array analysis is rapidly becoming a reliable method of diagnostic investigation in individuals with mental retardation and congenital anomalies, leading to the identification of several novel microdeletion and microduplication syndromes. We have identified seven individuals with duplication on chromosome 14q11.2q13.1, who exhibited idiopathic developmental delay and cognitive impairment, severe speech delay, and developmental epilepsy. Among these cases, the minimal common duplicated region on chromosome 14q11.2q13.1 includes only three genes, FOXG1, C14orf23, and PRKD1. We propose that increased dosage of Forkhead Box G1 (FOXG1) is the best candidate to explain the abnormal neurodevelopmental phenotypes observed in our patients. Deletions and inactivating mutations of FOXG1 have been associated with a Rett-like syndrome characterized by hypotonia, irritability, developmental delay, hand stereotypies, and deceleration of head growth. FOXG1, encoding a brain-specific transcription factor, has an important role in the developing brain. In fact, in vivo studies in chicken brain demonstrated that overexpression of FOXG1 results in thickening of the neuroepithelium and outgrowth of the telencephalon and mesencephalum, secondary to a reduction in neuroepithelial cell apoptosis.\n",
      "Sialuria is a rare inborn error of metabolism in which excessive free sialic acid (N-acetylneuraminic acid, NeuAc) is synthesized. A defect in the feedback inhibition of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) 2-epimerase by the end-product of the sialic acid synthetic pathway, CMP-NeuAc, is the mechanism underlying this overproduction. Recent evidence suggests that sialuria is an autosomal dominant disorder. Only five patients have been documented to have such an enzymatic defect. We report a longitudinal study of one of the original sialuria patients, to age 11 years. Although he has coarse features and massive hepatomegaly, he has shown normal growth and relatively normal development. Pulmonary function testing showed minimal small airway obstruction. At 11 years, he developed intermittent abdominal pain and transient transaminase elevation above his baseline. Sialuria should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a patient with a phenotype suggestive of a mucopolysaccharidosis or oligosaccharidosis in the absence of developmental regression or prominent dysostosis multiplex. We recommend close monitoring of liver and pulmonary function in sialuria patients.\n",
      "We identified a novel 1.39 Mb interstitial deletion of chromosome 12p13.33 in an 8 year-old Caucasian female propositus and her affected father and brother using microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH). They share a history of developmental delay and staring episodes. The deleted region contains eight annotated genes (ERC1, FBXL14, WNT5B, ADIPOR2, CACNA2D4, LRTM2, DCP1B, and CACNA1C). Hemizygous deletions of ERC1, FBXL14, or WNT5B genes may be involved in the development of neurological disorders in these individuals. Furthermore, the centromeric breakpoint of the 1.39 Mb deleted region is the same as the centromeric breakpoint of a 2.3 Mb terminal deletion of 12p13.33 reported recently, indicating the presence of an unstable structure near the breakpoint facilitating recurrent genomic rearrangements.\n",
      "In 2 unrelated families 9 males presented with ataxia, apraxia, and neuropsychological abnormalities or mental deficiency, inherited as an X-linked recessive syndrome with partial clinical expression in obligate female carriers. The symptoms were present in early childhood and were non-progressive. Additional findings in 2 males were congenital \"club-feet\" and generalized seizures. The affected males were 13-62 years old at the time of our examination. Chromosome abnormalities including fragile X fra(X) could not be demonstrated in any case. Results of metabolic screenings were also normal. The clinical picture with X-linked recessive inheritance distinguishes this syndrome from previously described inherited hereditary ataxias.\n",
      "A considerable volume of literature has been published on the association of lacrimal outflow dysgenesis with developmental anomalies or systemic syndromes. We report three affected individuals in a consanguineous family those are associated with bilateral ptosis, upper ocular movement limitation, and absence of the lacrimal punctum. T our knowledge, this is the first article reporting the association of bilateral ptosis, facial dysmorphism, upper ocular movement limitation, and absence of the lacrimal punctum in a hereditary form. As a sole example, these findings may be accepted as a new syndrome with autosomal recessive pattern because of consanguinity.\n",
      "Chronic inflammatory demyelinative polyneuropathy (CIDP) is an acquired neuropathy, presumably of immunological origin. Its clinical presentation and course are extremely variable. CIDP is one of the few peripheral neuropathies amenable to treatment. Typical cases associate progressive or relapsing-remitting motor and sensory deficit with increased CSF protein content and electrophysiological features of demyelination. In other instances the neuropathy is predominantly or exclusively motor or sensory, CSF normal and electrophysiological studies fail to show evidence of demyelination. In such cases conventional diagnostic criteria are not filled yet the patient may respond to immunomodulatory treatments. In this paper we review the diagnostic pitfalls and clinical variants of CIDP to illustrate the problems that may arise. The different therapeutic options are reviewed. Axon loss associated with demyelination is the most important factor of disability and resistance to treatment.\n",
      "A new form of ectodermal dysplasia was observed in two siblings, offspring of healthy non-consanguineous parents. The main findings in both children are: hypodontia, abnormally shaped teeth, scalp hypotrichosis, pili annulati, follicular hyperkeratosis on the trunk and limbs, intensified delineation and reticular hyperpigmentation of the nape, and hyperopia; one of the siblings also has astigmatism. As both patients have normal nails and are euhidrotic, this is an ectodermal dysplasia of the pilodental subgroup. The cause is probably genetic and autosomal-recessive inheritance is most likely.\n",
      "Five cases of the same congenital malformation of the nose, affecting the nasal dorsum and the supra-tip, were supported in our university plastic surgery center. This malformation has not been described in the literature known to the authors. The aim of this study is to analyze this nasal deformity.Five children presented this congenital deformity between 1994¬†and 2014. The patients were examined and the malformation precisely described. Genetic and histological examinations were carried on. The diagnosis and treatment of this pathology were discussed.This malformation associated 4¬†anomalies: hypertrophy of soft tissue of the dorsum located in the middle third of the nasal bridge, deformed alar cartilages turned back downward and outside, advanced support default and median skin brand similar to a scar. These patients showed no other abnormalities of the midline or respiratory disorders. No genetic disorder was found for these five patients, and no histological arguments were found. Three patients were operated, one until adulthood with a satisfying cosmetic result.Bibliographic research has not allowed us to make an accurate diagnosis of this malformation that appears to be non-syndromic and to have a genetic origin. Our therapeutic approach became more clear and it now seems legitimate to propose early excision of fat mass to prevent alar deformations, associated with a cortico-cancellous graft, which in our experience grows with age, to support the tip.\n",
      "Two unrelated patients, presenting with significant global developmental delay, severe progressive microcephaly, seizures, spasticity and thin corpus callosum (CC) underwent trio whole-exome sequencing. No candidate variant was found in any known genes related to the phenotype. However, crossing the data of the patients illustrated that they both manifested pathogenic variants in the SLC1A4 gene which codes the ASCT1 transporter of serine and other neutral amino acids. The Ashkenazi patient is homozygous for a deleterious missense c.766G>A, p.(E256K) mutation whereas the Ashkenazi-Iraqi patient is compound heterozygous for this mutation and a nonsense c.945delTT, p.(Leu315Hisfs*42) mutation. Structural prediction demonstrates truncation of significant portion of the protein by the nonsense mutation and speculates functional disruption by the missense mutation. Both mutations are extremely rare in general population databases, however, the missense mutation was found in heterozygous mode in 1:100 Jewish Ashkenazi controls suggesting a higher carrier rate among Ashkenazi Jews. We conclude that SLC1A4 is the disease causing gene of a novel neurologic disorder manifesting with significant intellectual disability, severe postnatal microcephaly, spasticity and thin CC. The role of SLC1A4 in the serine transport from astrocytes to neurons suggests a possible pathomechanism for this disease and implies a potential therapeutic approach.\n",
      "We report on a 13 year old boy with microcephaly, sloping forehead, prominent nose, scoliosis, and flexion contractures involving the elbows and knees. The patient showed severe mental and growth retardation. Since birth and up to the present he has suffered from multiple and varied infections. Immunological studies showed a marked decrease in leucocyte chemotaxis. Clinical and laboratory findings confirm the similarity of this case to the two brothers described by Say et al. We have not found any descriptions of similar patients. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the phenotypic delineation of this syndrome and to highlight the need for immunological investigation in patients with multiple congenital malformations.\n",
      "A-7-year-old boy was found to have histidinuria without histidinemia. Low concentrations of histidine in plasma were consistent with impaired intestinal and renal tubular absorption of histidine. The patient was developmentally delayed and had some minor anomalies. Only 4 other patients in 3 families have been reported. Each had abnormality of the central nervous system. All were male.\n",
      "Smith-McCort dysplasia (SMC OMIM 615222) and Dyggve-Melchior-Clausen dysplasia (DMC OMIM 223800) are allelic skeletal dysplasias caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in DYM (OMIM 607461). Both disorders share the same skeletal phenotypes characterized by spondylo-epi-metaphyseal dysplasia with distinctive lacy ilia. The difference rests on the presence or absence of intellectual disability, that is, intellectual disability in DMC and normal cognition in SMC. However, genetic heterogeneity was suspected in SMC. Recently, RAB33B (OMIM 605950) has been identified as the second gene for SMC. Nevertheless, only two affected families have been reported so far. Here we present three SMC patients with four novel pathogenic variants in RAB33B, including homozygosity for c.211C>T (p.R71*), homozygosity for c.365T>C (p.F122S), and compound heterozygosity for c.48delCGGGGCAG (p.G17Vfs*58) and c.490C>T (p.Q164*). We also summarize the clinical, radiological, and mutation profile of RAB33B after literature mining. This report ascertains the pathogenic relationship between RAB33B and SMC. √Ç¬© 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: We report novel defects of mitochondrial translation elongation factor Ts (EFTs), with high carrier frequency in Finland and expand the manifestations of this disease group from infantile cardiomyopathy to juvenile neuropathy/encephalopathy disorders. METHODS: DNA analysis, whole-exome analysis, protein biochemistry, and protein modeling. RESULTS: We used whole-exome sequencing to find the genetic cause of infantile-onset mitochondrial cardiomyopathy, progressing to juvenile-onset Leigh syndrome, neuropathy, and optic atrophy in 2 siblings. We found novel compound heterozygous mutations, c.944G>A [p.C315Y] and c.856C>T [p.Q286X], in the TSFM gene encoding mitochondrial EFTs. The same p.Q286X variant was found as compound heterozygous with a splice site change in a patient from a second family, with juvenile-onset optic atrophy, peripheral neuropathy, and ataxia. Our molecular modeling predicted the coding-region mutations to cause protein instability, which was experimentally confirmed in cultured patient cells, with mitochondrial translation defect and lacking EFTs. Only a single TSFM mutation has been previously described in different populations, leading to an infantile fatal multisystem disorder with cardiomyopathy. Sequence data from 35,000 Finnish population controls indicated that the heterozygous carrier frequency of p.Q286X change was exceptionally high in Finland, 1:80, but no homozygotes were found in the population, in our mitochondrial disease patient collection, or in an intrauterine fetal death material, suggesting early developmental lethality of the homozygotes. CONCLUSIONS: We show that in addition to early-onset cardiomyopathy, TSFM mutations should be considered in childhood and juvenile encephalopathies with optic and/or peripheral neuropathy, ataxia, or Leigh disease.\n",
      "The DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs; encoded by PRKDC) functions in DNA non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), the major DNA double strand break (DSB) rejoining pathway. NHEJ also functions during lymphocyte development, joining V(D)J recombination intermediates during antigen receptor gene assembly. Here, we describe a patient with compound heterozygous mutations in PRKDC, low DNA-PKcs expression, barely detectable DNA-PK kinase activity, and impaired DSB repair. In a heterologous expression system, we found that one of the PRKDC mutations inactivated DNA-PKcs, while the other resulted in dramatically diminished but detectable residual function. The patient suffered SCID with reduced or absent T and B cells, as predicted from PRKDC-deficient animal models. Unexpectedly, the patient was also dysmorphic; showed severe growth failure, microcephaly, and seizures; and had profound, globally impaired neurological function. MRI scans revealed microcephaly-associated cortical and hippocampal dysplasia and progressive atrophy over 2 years of life. These neurological features were markedly more severe than those observed in patients with deficiencies in other NHEJ proteins. Although loss of DNA-PKcs in mice, dogs, and horses was previously shown not to impair neuronal development, our findings demonstrate a stringent requirement for DNA-PKcs during human neuronal development and suggest that high DNA-PK protein expression is required to sustain efficient pre- and postnatal neurogenesis.\n",
      "We describe the identification and clinical presentation of four individuals from three unrelated families with hemizygous deletions involving the DPYD gene at chromosome 1p21.3. DPYD encodes dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, which is the initial and rate-limiting enzyme in the catabolism of pyrimidine bases. All four individuals described met diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum disorder with severe speech delay. Patient 1's deletion was originally reported in 2008, and more detailed clinical information is provided. Subsequently, this male individual was found to have a missense mutation in the X-linked PTCHD1 autism susceptibility gene, which may also contribute to the phenotype. Patients 2 and 3 are siblings with a novel deletion encompassing the DPYD gene. In their mother, the genomic region deleted from chromosome 1p21.3 was inserted into chromosome 10. A fourth proband had a novel 10-kb intragenic deletion of exon 6 of the DPYD gene detected on a higher resolution microarray. Our study suggests that hemizygous deletions involving the DPYD locus present with variable phenotypes which can include speech delay and autistic features, and may also be influenced by additional mutations in other genes, issues which need to be considered in genetic counseling.\n",
      "A brother and sister, the offspring of first cousins, are described with retinitis pigmentosa, trichodysplasia (hypotrichosis and structural changes), dental anomalies, and onychodysplasia. This is a pure ectodermal dysplasia of the tricho-odonto-onychial subgroup, probably due to an autosomal recessive gene.\n",
      "We describe two opposite sexed sibs, the offspring of consanguineous Pakistani parents, with a previously undescribed syndrome. The main features are short ribs with a narrow chest and thoracic dysplasia, mild shortening of the limbs, communicating hydrocephalus, and developmental delay. One sib was diagnosed prenatally by ultrasound at 18 weeks' gestation. The inheritance of the condition is presumed to be autosomal recessive.\n",
      "The DONSON gene encodes the downstream neighbor of SON, a replisome component that stabilizes the replication fork during replication. A severe form of microcephalic dwarfism, microcephaly-micromelia syndrome (MIMIS), has been recently associated with DONSON biallelic loss of function. Affected fetuses suffer severe growth restriction, microcephaly, and variable limb malformations which result in intrauterine or perinatal death. All described fetuses carried a homozygous founder mutation (c.1047-9A>G), a splice-altering variant that leads to transcript degradation. We evaluated 2 newborns from a consanguineous Emirati family with severe microcephaly, micromelia, craniofacial dysmorphism, and skeletal abnormalities; both died shortly after birth. Here, we report the second homozygous loss-of-function variant (c.763C>T) in DONSON causing MIMIS, and we provide detailed clinical description of this very rare disorder. In addition, we review all MIMIS cases in the literature and summarize the striking features of this phenotype. This manuscript is aimed to increase the clinical understanding of this rare, extremely severe disorder and encourage clinical and molecular geneticists to consider screening for DONSON loss-of-function variants in families with recurrent pregnancy loss and/or perinatal deaths.\n",
      "Four of five siblings born of a consanguineous marriage demonstrated abnormalities of the lens (ectopia lentis and dense cataracts) and retina (generalized tapetoretinal dystrophy and total retinal detachment) associated with myopia.

      "Dyskeratosis congenita (DC) is a telomere biology disorder characterized by a mucocutaneous triad, aplastic anemia, and predisposition to cancer. Mutations in a narrow segment of TINF2 exon 6 have been recognized to cause often-severe DC that is either sporadic or autosomal dominant. We describe three children with very early presentations of DC, including one with the severe variant known as Revesz syndrome. Although most TINF2 mutations reported to date are missense changes, each of our patients carried a novel heterozygous nonsense or frameshift mutation, revealing a new 5' boundary to the affected gene segment in patients with DC. Examination of patient-derived lymphoblastoid cell lines revealed stable expression of the predicted truncated TIN2 proteins. In co-immunoprecipitation assays, the ability of a truncation mutant to interact with TRF1 was severely impaired, whereas the ability of the most common DC-associated mutant was much less affected. This suggests that the disruption of TIN2-TRF1 interaction may contribute to the severe clinical phenotype observed in the context of the TIN2 truncation mutation, but is unlikely to be the primary cause of telomere shortening associated with the more prevalent TIN2 missense mutations. Telomere flow-fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of one pedigree showed the dramatic effect a de novo nonsense TINF2 mutation had on telomere length in early development. These cases underscore the severe manifestations of truncating TINF2 mutations.\n",
      "A recent study of exome analyses in 109 patients with undiagnosed diseases included a 5-year-old girl with intellectual disability and multiple congenital anomalies, who had an apparently de novo frameshift mutation in SON. However, the combination of the truncating mutation in SON and the phenotype has not been reproduced until date, and it remains unclear if this combination represents a distinctive disease entity. Here we report an additional male with intellectual disability, congenital heart disease, distinctive facial features with curly hair and protruding ears, and long slender extremities, and hyperextensible joints. Exome analysis showed that he had the same de novo frameshift mutation in SON in a heterozygous state. Along with the first and original description of the apparently de novo truncating mutation in SON mentioned above, we have established that haploinsufficiency of SON causes a new recognizable syndrome of intellectual disability. SON is located within 21q22.11, a critical region for Braddock-Carey syndrome, which is characterized by congenital thrombocytopenia, intellectual disability, micrognathia, and a distinctive facies. Therefore, we suggest that the intellectual disability observed in Braddock-Carey syndrome could be accounted for by haploinsufficiency of SON. √Ç¬© 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\n",
      "Galloway-Mowat syndrome (GAMOS) is a phenotypically heterogeneous disorder characterized by neurodevelopmental defects combined with renal-glomerular disease, manifesting with proteinuria. To identify additional monogenic disease causes, we here performed whole exome sequencing (WES), linkage analysis, and homozygosity mapping in three affected siblings of an Indian family with GAMOS. Applying established criteria for variant filtering, we identify a novel homozygous splice site mutation in the gene WDR4 as the likely disease-causing mutation in this family. In line with previous reports, we observe growth deficiency, microcephaly, developmental delay, and intellectual disability as phenotypic features resulting from WDR4 mutations. However, the newly identified allele additionally gives rise to proteinuria and nephrotic syndrome, a phenotype that was never reported in patients with WDR4 mutations. Our data thus expand the phenotypic spectrum of WDR4 mutations by demonstrating that, depending on the specific mutated allele, a renal phenotype may be present. This finding suggests that GAMOS may occupy a phenotypic spectrum with other microcephalic diseases. Furthermore, WDR4 is an additional example of a gene that encodes a tRNA modifying enzyme and gives rise to GAMOS, if mutated. Our findings thereby support the recent observation that, like neurons, podocytes of the renal glomerulus are particularly vulnerable to cellular defects resulting from altered tRNA modifications.\n",
      "Ohdo syndrome (MIM 249620) is a multiple malformation syndrome characterized by blepharophimosis, ptosis, dental hypoplasia, hearing impairment and intellectual disability. A wide range of dysmorphic features and congenital abnormalities have been described in cases reported as Ohdo and Ohdo-like syndromes. We report a further two cases of Ohdo syndrome, one with mild features and the other more severely affected, illustrating the phenotypic variability of the condition. A review of the literature highlights the severe phenotype associated with distinctive facial features, as seen in Case 2 in this report All cases with the severe phenotype have been sporadic. Subtelomeric FISH studies of all chromosome arms on the two cases showed no abnormality. We propose clinical criteria for the diagnosis of Ohdo syndrome and delineate features of the severe phenotype.\n",

      "We report a sister and brother with congenital heart defects, hamartomas of the tongue and polydactyly. Both had coarctation of the aorta, which was repaired in early infancy. In addition, the girl had atrioventricular canal. She died postoperatively at age 4 years. The boy had subaortic stenosis and died of pneumonia at age 2 years. Both children had normal psychomotor development. The parents were healthy and unrelated. The familial occurrence could be due to a previously unrecognized autosomal recessive syndrome or parental gonadal mosaicism for a dominant syndrome.\n",

      "Spondylo-meta-epiphyseal dysplasia (SMED), short limb-abnormal calcification type (SMED, SL-AC), is a very rare autosomal recessive disorder with various skeletal changes characterized by premature calcification leading to severe disproportionate short stature. Twenty-two patients have been reported until now, but only five mutations (four missense and one splice-site) in the conserved sequence encoding the tyrosine kinase domain of the DDR2 gene has been identified. We report here a novel DDR2 missense mutation, c.370C‚Äâ>‚ÄâT (p.Arg124Trp) in a Moroccan girl with SMED, SL-AC, identified by whole exome sequencing. Our study has expanded the mutational spectrum of this rare disease and it has shown that exome sequencing is a powerful and cost-effective tool for the diagnosis of clinically heterogeneous disorders such as SMED.\n",
      "Disorders of keratinization (DOK) show marked genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity. In most cases, disease is primarily cutaneous, and further clinical evaluation is therefore rarely pursued. We have identified subjects with a novel DOK featuring erythrokeratodermia and initially-asymptomatic, progressive, potentially fatal cardiomyopathy, a finding not previously associated with erythrokeratodermia. We show that de novo missense mutations clustered tightly within a single spectrin repeat of DSP cause this novel cardio-cutaneous disorder, which we term erythrokeratodermia-cardiomyopathy (EKC) syndrome. We demonstrate that DSP mutations in our EKC syndrome subjects affect localization of desmosomal proteins and connexin 43 in the skin, and result in desmosome aggregation, widening of intercellular spaces, and lipid secretory defects. DSP encodes desmoplakin, a primary component of desmosomes, intercellular adhesion junctions most abundant in the epidermis and heart. Though mutations in DSP are known to cause other disorders, our cohort features the unique clinical finding of severe whole-body erythrokeratodermia, with distinct effects on localization of desmosomal proteins and connexin 43. These findings add a severe, previously undescribed syndrome featuring erythrokeratodermia and cardiomyopathy to the spectrum of disease caused by mutation in DSP, and identify a specific region of the protein critical to the pathobiology of EKC syndrome and to DSP function in the heart and skin.\n",
      "Fatal congenital nonlysosomal cardiac glycogenosis has been attributed to a subtype of phosphorylase kinase deficiency, but the underlying genes and mutations have not been identified. Analyzing four sporadic, unrelated patients, we found no mutations either in the eight genes encoding phosphorylase kinase subunits or in the two genes encoding the muscle and brain isoforms of glycogen phosphorylase. However, in three of five patients, we identified identical heterozygous R531Q missense mutations of the PRKAG2 gene, which encodes the gamma 2-subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase, a key regulator of energy balance. Biochemical characterization of the recombinant R531Q mutant protein showed >100-fold reduction of binding affinities for the regulatory nucleotides AMP and ATP but an enhanced basal activity and increased phosphorylation of the alpha -subunit. Other PRKAG2 missense mutations were previously identified in patients with autosomal dominant hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, characterized by juvenile-to-adult clinical onset, moderate cardiac glycogenosis, disturbed excitation conduction, risk of sudden cardiac death in midlife, and molecular perturbations that are similar to--but less severe than--those observed for the R531Q mutation. Thus, recurrent heterozygous R531Q missense mutations in PRKAG2 give rise to a massive nonlysosomal cardiac glycogenosis of fetal symptomatic onset and rapidly fatal course, constituting a genotypically and clinically distinct variant of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. R531Q and other PRKAG2 mutations enhance the basal activity and alpha -subunit phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase, explaining the dominant nature of PRKAG2 disease mutations. Since not all cases displayed PRKAG2 mutations, fatal congenital nonlysosomal cardiac glycogenosis seems to be genetically heterogeneous. However, the existence of a heart-specific primary phosphorylase kinase deficiency is questionable, because no phosphorylase kinase mutations were found.\n",
      "Atrial septal defect of the ostium secundum type is almost always sporadic, with multifactorial inheritance. We report a case of a family in which atrial septal defects of the ostium secundum type with atrioventricular conduction defects were observed in four generations: five proven cases and two probable cases. Ten families have been reported as showing atrial septal defect of the ostium secundum type and atrioventricular conduction defects with dominant inheritance. Moreover, in our family the transmission model can also confirm autosomal dominant inheritance. We believe that cardiologists should take a familial approach to atrial septal defect of the ostium secundum type for both research and genetic counseling purposes. In a patient with ASD II, the AV conduction defects should prompt a detailed family history and clinical evaluation of first-degree relatives.\n",
      "Chromosomal microarray analysis has become a powerful diagnostic tool in the investigation of patients with intellectual disability leading to the discovery of dosage sensitive genes implicated in the manifestation of various genomic disorders. Interstitial deletions of the short arm of chromosome 10 represent rare genetic abnormalities, especially those encompassing the chromosomal region 10p11-p12. To date, only 10 postnatal cases with microdeletion of this region have been described, and all patients shared a common phenotype, including intellectual disability, abnormal behavior, distinct dysmorphic features, visual impairment, and cardiac malformations. WAC was suggested to be the main candidate gene for intellectual disability associated with 10 p11-p12 deletion syndrome. Here, we describe a new case of de novo 10p11.23-p12.1 microdeletion in a patient with intellectual disability, abnormal behavior, and distinct dysmorphic features. Our observation allows us to redefine the smallest region of overlap among patients reported so far, with a size of 80‚ÄâKb and which contains only the WAC gene. These findings strengthen the hypothesis that haploinsufficency of WAC gene might be likely responsible for intellectual disability and behavior disorders. Our data also led us to propose a clinical pathway for patients with this recognizable genetic syndrome depending on the facial dysmorphisms. ¬© 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\n",
      "We report on 2 boys (maternal cousins), with severe congenital ataxia with generalized hypotonia, psychomotor retardation and recurrent bronchopulmonary infections. Later, they developed myoclonic encephalopathy and macular degeneration. Serial brain imaging investigations showed a cyst of the septum pellucidum, persistence of the cavum vergae, corpus callosum and cerebellar vermis hypoplasia without cortical atrophy. In the maternal pedigree, 5 males had recurrent bronchopneumonia associated with severe congenital hypotonia and died during the first years of life. Neurophysiological studies, including nerve conduction velocities, brainstem auditory evoked responses, somatosensory evoked potentials were normal. Electroretinogram showed normal wave morphology. Visual evoked potentials were mildly impaired. Extensive screening for metabolic disease gave normal results. Immunologic investigations showed normal T and B cell number, T cell function and immunoglobulin levels in both patients with a reduced level of IgG2 subclass in one.\n",
      "Vocal cord paralysis is a common cause of neonatal stridor. Familial vocal cord dysfunction, however, is unusual. All three siblings in one family had neonatal stridor. Vocal cord dysfunction was confirmed after endoscopic examination in two of the children; a temporary tracheotomy was required by one child. Results of evaluation, including pulmonary function tests, suggest discrete dysfunction localized to the neuromuscular pathway responsible for vocal cord abduction. Endoscopy is of prime importance in the diagnosis of vocal cord dysfunction. In considering therapy, the physician must weigh both the potentially life-threatening nature of vocal cord paralysis, as well as the likelihood of eventual spontaneous resolution of many familial and idiopathic cases.\n",
      "We report on the occurrence of Pfeiffer-type cardiocranial syndrome in a brother and sister born to unaffected parents. The cardinal manifestations of the syndrome are congenital heart defect, sagittal craniosynostosis, genital anomalies, and mental and growth retardation. The craniosynostosis was present in only one of the sibs, suggesting intrafamilial variability of the syndrome. The clinical spectrum of cardiocranial syndrome is further expanded by the inclusion of renal, joint, and palpebral abnormalities detected in our patients. The occurrence of the syndrome in a brother-sister sib pair supports the hypothesis of an autosomal-recessive inheritance.\n",
      "We have studied 9 cases with the combination of some form of holoprosencephaly and any degree of caudal dysgenesis. The cases were identified through the Spanish Collaborative Study of Congenital Malformations (ECEMC). Of the 9 cases, 6 infants had an aneuploidy syndrome, one had Meckel syndrome, and 2 cases were of unknown etiology. We determined that the prevalence figure for the association of both conditions in the same child was 0.08 per 10,000 livebirths, and 18.8 times higher for stillbirths (i.e., 1.50/10,000). This prevalence is significantly higher than what would be expected by chance.\n",

      "Ovotesticular disorder of sex development (OT-DSD) is a rare disorder of sexual differentiation in which the gonads of an individual are characterized by the presence of both mature ovarian and testicular tissues. The objective of this paper is to report the clinical, cytogenetic and histopathological findings in Sri Lankan patients diagnosed with OT-DSD who were referred to the Human Genetics Unit for cytogenetic evaluation during 2005 to 2011. Five patients had histopathologically confirmed OT-DSD. Their ages at presentation ranged from 2 mo to 47 yr. Clinical symptoms varied from ambiguous genitalia and inguinal hernias at birth to a lower abdominal mass presenting in adulthood. All 5 were reared as phenotypic males. An ovotestis was detected in all cases except one, and the predominant karyotype was 46,XY. The findings in this series of predominantly 46,XY karyotype are in contrast to previously published reports that have reported 46,XX as being the predominant karyotype. It is therefore recommended that individuals with ambiguous genitalia who have the 46,XY karyotype should be thoroughly investigated by ultrasonographic or laparoscopic assessment to determine the exact nature of their internal genital organs. OT-DSD should also be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with cryptorchidism and inguinal hernia.\n",
      "A study of the ring chromosome 13 syndrome is presented with detailed clinical and cytogenetic features of three new unrelated cases. The clinical limits of this syndrome can now be defined. An analysis of these cases together with those in the literature indicates that the syndrome forms a continuous spectrum, and no further taxonomic subdivision is possible at this stage of knowledge. The chromosome breakpoints in the first two cases are 13p11 and 13q32 and in the third case 13p11 and 13q33 or 13q34. All described cases of the ring 13 syndrome have breakpoints within the region bounded by bands 13q21 to 13q34. All rings are negative for silver banding. Peripheral blood cultures showed an average of 88% of metaphases to be 46,XX,r(13), with the remaining 12% manifesting either random loss or ring duplication. The rings vary in size and show a variable number of centromeres. An estimate of the birth incidence of this condition in the Anglo-Saxon population is 1 in 58,000. Parents of affected children are clinically and cytogenetically normal, the rings in affected offspring being meiotic in origin.\n",
      "Chondrodysplasia punctata (CDP) is associated with a variety of genetic and nongenetic conditions. We report a girl with CDP, complex congenital cardiac disease, central nervous system (CNS) anomalies, and clinical findings that resemble those of the sibs described by Toriello et al. [1993, Am J Med Genet 47:797-799]. The cardiac defects and CNS abnormalities reported are unique in the context of CDP and may serve to expand the phenotypic spectrum of the unique form of CDP described by Toriello et al. [1993].\n",
      "Five patients are described with a progressive sensory neuropathy in association with a spastic paraplegia and a mutilating lower limb acropathy. Disease onset was in childhood. Two pairs of siblings were both the offspring of normal consanguinous parents, suggesting autosomal recessive inheritance. The fifth case was sporadic; her parents were normal and non-consanguinous. Nerve biopsy in three patients showed an axonopathy with a loss of myelinated nerve fibres of all diameters and also of unmyelinated axons. In combination with the previous report by Cavanagh et al. (Brain 1979; 102: 79-94), the present patients establish the existence of an autosomal recessive form of hereditary sensory neuropathy with spastic paraplegia. There have been previous descriptions of a dominantly inherited form.\n",
      "Osteopathia striata with cranial sclerosis (OS-CS) is a rare skeletal dysplasia characterized by linear striations of the long bones, osteosclerosis of the cranium, and extra-skeletal anomalies. We provide a comprehensive description of the skeletal phenotype in a French-Canadian girl with a moderate to severe form of sporadic OS-CS. Multiple medical problems, including anal stenosis and the Pierre-Robin sequence, were evident in the first few years of life. At 14 years, she was fully mobile, with normal intellect and stature. She suffered chronic lower extremity pain in the absence of fractures, as well as severe headaches, unilateral facial paralysis, and bilateral mixed hearing loss. Biochemical indices of bone and mineral metabolism were within normal limits. Bone densitometry showed increased areal bone mineral density in the skull, trunk, and pelvis, but not in the upper and lower extremities. An iliac bone biopsy specimen revealed an increased amount of trabecular bone. Trabeculae were abnormally thick, but there was no evidence of disturbed bone remodeling. In a cranial bone specimen, multiple layers of periosteal bone were found that covered a compact cortical compartment containing tightly packed haversian canals. Bone lamellation was normal in both the iliac and skull samples. Osteoclast differentiation studies showed that peripheral blood osteoclast precursors from this patient formed functional osteoclasts in vitro. Thus, studies of bone metabolism did not explain why bone mass is increased in most skeletal areas of this patient. Cranial histology points to exuberant periosteal bone formation as a potential cause of the cranial sclerosis.\n",
      "The follow-up history and oral findings in two brothers from consanguineous parents suggest that the association of dentinogenesis imperfecta (DI), delayed tooth eruption, mild mental retardation, proportionate short stature, sensorineural hearing loss and dysmorphic facies may represent a new syndrome with autosomal recessive inheritance. Histological examination of the dentin matrix of a permanent molar from one of the siblings reveals morphological similarities with defective dentinogenesis as presenting in patients affected with Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI), a condition caused by deficiency of type I collagen. A number of radiographic and histological characteristics, however, are inconsistent with classical features of DI. These findings suggest that DI may imply greater genetical heterogeneity than currently assumed.\n",
      "Three sibs and their mother with features of a multiple pterygium syndrome are reported.

      "Anauxetic dysplasia (AAD, OMIM 607095) is a rare skeletal dysplasia inherited as an autosomal recessive trait, which is caused by mutations in RMRP and allelic to a more common disorder, cartilage hair hypoplasia (CHH). CHH is a multi-system disorder with a variety of extraskeletal changes. Whereas AAD is a bone-restricted disorder with a more severe skeletal phenotype: affected individuals are extremely short and complicated by orthopedic morbidity, and the radiological changes include modification of the vertebral bodies and epiphyseal dysplasia of the hip, as well as generalized metaphyseal dysplasia and severe brachydactyly. Recently, genetic heterogeneity for AAD was proposed, because a familial case (two affected sibs) with an AAD-identical phenotype had compound heterozygous mutations in POP1, encoding a molecule functionally related to the gene product of RMRP. We report here a 5-year-old boy with the same phenotype born to a consanguineous couple. We identified a novel homozygous POP1 mutation (c.1744C>T, p.P582S) in the boy and the heterozygosity in the parents. It may be rational to coin the POP1-associated skeletal phenotype AAD type 2. ¬© 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\n",
      "In 1982, Nadol & Burgess reported a new syndrome of cataract and progressive sensorineural hearing loss, inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. Extensive histopathologic studies of the inner ear of the proband revealed severe cochleosaccular degeneration. No other sporadic or familial cases of such a genetic syndrome have subsequently been described. We report here a second family in which the syndrome of cataract and progressive sensorineural deafness is observed in eight members, and is inherited according to an autosomal dominant pattern.\n",
      "Intellectual disability is genetically heterogeneous, and it is likely that many of the responsible genes have not yet been identified. We describe three siblings with isolated, severe developmental encephalopathy. After extensive uninformative genetic and metabolic testing, whole exome sequencing identified a homozygous novel variant in glutamic pyruvate transaminase 2 (GPT2) or alanine transaminase 2 (ALT2), c.459 C‚Äâ>‚ÄâG p.Ser153Arg that segregated with developmental encephalopathy in the family. This variant was predicted to be damaging by all in silico prediction algorithms. GPT2 is the gene encoding ALT2 which is responsible for the reversible transamination of alanine and 2-oxoglutarate to form pyruvate and glutamate. GPT2 is expressed in brain and is in the pathway to generate glutamate, an excitatory neurotransmitter. Functional assays of recombinant wild-type and mutant ALT2 proteins demonstrated the p.Ser153Arg mutation resulted in a severe loss of enzymatic function. We suggest that recessively inherited loss of function GPT2 mutations are a novel cause of intellectual disability.\n",
      "Cases of holoprosencephaly which occurred in the west of Scotland over the past 20 years were ascertained from genetics, paediatric, and pathology department records. Fifty cases were identified of which 17 had an underlying cytogenetic abnormality. Of the remaining 33 cases, 26 were delivered after 28 weeks' gestation giving a birth prevalence of 1 in 26730. Twenty-one babies were liveborn and nine children are currently alive. All survivors are profoundly mentally retarded and most have seizures. Twenty-eight patients with non-chromosomal holoprosencephaly had a total of 23 sibs and three families were identified where there was either recurrence of holoprosencephaly (one family), a related cerebral malformation (one family), or mental handicap (one family) giving an overall recurrence risk for serious neurological disability of 12% (standard error 7%). We conclude that holoprosencephaly does not necessarily breed true and this observation should be taken into account when giving genetic counselling and attempting ultrasound prenatal diagnosis after the birth of an affected child.\n",
      "Defects in the mitochondrial translation apparatus can impair energy production in affected tissues and organs. Most components of this apparatus are encoded by nuclear genes, including GFM2, which encodes a mitochondrial ribosome recycling factor. A few patients with mutations in some of these genes have been reported to date. Here, we present two female siblings with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita, optic atrophy and severe mental retardation. The younger sister had a progressive cerebellar atrophy and bilateral neuropathological findings in the brainstem. Although her cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of lactate and pyruvate were not increased, brain magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed a lactate peak. Additionally, her CSF lactate/pyruvate and serum beta-hydroxybutyrate/acetoacetate ratios were high, and levels of oxidative phosphorylation in skin fibroblasts were reduced. We therefore diagnosed Leigh syndrome. Genomic investigation confirmed the presence of compound heterozygous GFM2 mutations (c.206+4A>G and c.2029-1G>A) in both siblings, causing aberrant splicing with premature stop codons (p.Gly50Glufs*4 and p.Ala677Leufs*2, respectively). These findings suggest that GFM2 mutations could be causative of a phenotype of Leigh syndrome with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita.\n",
      "Mutations in SLC34A1, encoding the proximal tubular sodium-phosphate transporter NaPi-IIa, may cause a range of clinical phenotypes including infantile hypercalcemia, a proximal renal Fanconi syndrome, which are typically autosomal recessive, and hypophosphatemic nephrolithiasis, which may be an autosomal dominant trait. Here, we report two patients with mixed clinical phenotypes, both with metabolic acidosis, hyperphosphaturia, and renal stones. Patient A had a single heterozygous pathogenic missense mutation (p.I456N) in SLC34A1, consistent with the autosomal dominant pattern of renal stone disease in this family. Patient B, with an autosomal recessive pattern of disease, was compound heterozygous for SLC34A1 variants; a missense variant (p.R512C) together with a relatively common in-frame deletion p.V91A97del7 (91del7). Xenopus oocyte and renal (HKC-8) cell line transfection studies of the variants revealed limited cell surface localization, consistent with trafficking defects. Co-expression of wild-type and I456N and 91del7 appeared to cause intracellular retention in HKC-8, whereas the R512C mutant had a less dominant effect. Expression in Xenopus oocytes failed to demonstrate a significant dominant negative effect for I456N and R512C; however, a negative impact of 91del7 on [32 P]phosphate transport was found. In conclusion, we have investigated pathogenic alleles of SLC34A1 which contribute to both autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive renal stone disease.\n",
      "Previously, at least 29 different forms of autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) have been described. We describe a family with four members through three generations with autosomal dominant ataxia in combination with miosis and hyperreflexia. This family's ataxia does not match any of the previously described SCAs and is probably a novel form of SCA. To continue with the search for the genetic background of this disease, more cases are needed.\n",
      "Infantile cardiomyopathies are devastating fatal disorders of the neonatal period or the first year of life. Mitochondrial dysfunction is a common cause of this group of diseases, but the underlying gene defects have been characterized in only a minority of cases, because tissue specificity of the manifestation hampers functional cloning and the heterogeneity of causative factors hinders collection of informative family materials. We sequenced the exome of a patient who died at the age of 10¬†months of hypertrophic mitochondrial cardiomyopathy with combined cardiac respiratory chain complex I and IV deficiency. Rigorous data analysis allowed us to identify a homozygous missense mutation in AARS2, which we showed to encode the mitochondrial alanyl-tRNA synthetase (mtAlaRS). Two siblings from another family, both of whom died perinatally of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, had the same mutation, compound heterozygous with another missense mutation. Protein structure modeling of mtAlaRS suggested that one of the mutations affected a unique tRNA recognition site in the editing domain, leading to incorrect tRNA aminoacylation, whereas the second mutation severely disturbed the catalytic function, preventing tRNA aminoacylation. We show here that mutations in AARS2 cause perinatal or infantile cardiomyopathy with near-total combined mitochondrial respiratory chain deficiency in the heart. Our results indicate that exome sequencing is a powerful tool for identifying mutations in single patients and allows recognition of the genetic background in single-gene disorders of variable clinical manifestation and tissue-specific disease. Furthermore, we show that mitochondrial disorders extend to prenatal life and are an important cause of early infantile cardiac failure.\n",
      "We recently evaluated two of the original three patients (siblings) diagnosed with Proximal Myopathy with Focal Depletion of Mitochondria. The condition was named for the distinctive pattern of enlarged mitochondria around the periphery of muscle fibres with a complete absence in the middle. These siblings, aged 37 and 40, are cognitively normal with mild non-progressive muscle weakness and a susceptibility to rhabdomyolysis. Both were shown to be compound heterozygotes for novel mutations (c.263C>T‚Äâ+‚Äâc.950T>A) in CHKB, the gene currently associated with Megaconial Congenital Muscular Dystrophy. Individuals with this condition have early-onset muscle weakness and profound intellectual disability but share the same unique pattern on muscle biopsy as was noted in Proximal Myopathy with Focal Depletion of Mitochondria; focal depletion of mitochondria was surrounded by abnormally large \"megaconial\" mitochondria. Thus the phenotypic spectrum of CHKB mutations ranges from a congenital muscular dystrophy with intellectual disability to a later-onset non-progressive muscular weakness with normal cognition.\n",
      "PURPOSE: Peters anomaly is a rare dramatic finding at birth and can be associated with other systemic malformations. We performed a literature review of multiple case reports and case series to better define the common characteristics and unusual findings associated with Peters anomaly. METHODS: A representative case is discussed followed by a literature review of multiple case reports and case series. The literature search was conducted for the years 1969 to 2009. Cases and case series were included in the review of published English ophthalmic literature. Cases were excluded if no information was reported on ocular and systemic malformations or if no information was reported on surgical interventions or outcomes. In addition, if cases did not report laterality of the lesion, they were excluded from the review. Fifty-eight cases were found that fit the above criteria, and the relevant cases were reviewed to better characterize the systemic malformations, interventions, and outcomes associated with Peters anomaly reported in the literature. RESULTS: Fifty-eight cases of Peters anomaly were reviewed. Of those cases reporting sex, 56% were men and 44% of cases were women. In terms of laterality, 67.2% of cases were bilateral versus 32.8% of cases that were unilateral. Moreover, bilateral cases of Peters anomaly were associated with a higher rate of systemic malformations (71.8%) versus unilateral Peters anomaly (36.8%). This difference was significant (P < 0.03 by Fischer exact test). In the 15 eyes where results of penetrating keratoplasty were reported, the overall success rate was 53%. However, the success rate was significantly higher in patients with Peters anomaly type I (87.5%), as opposed to those patients with Peters anomaly type II (14.2%) (P < 0.02 by Fischer exact test). DISCUSSION: The clinical features, epidemiology, genetics, complications, and treatments of Peters anomaly are presented. Cornea specialists who care for pediatric patients should be aware of the common and uncommon associations with Peters anomaly. Although bilateral Peters anomaly is much more commonly associated with systemic malformations, we believe that all patients with Peters anomaly should be screened for systemic malformations by both pediatricians and geneticists and undergo chromosomal analysis and molecular genetic testing.\n",
      "A family with hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy (HMSN) type II is described in which 10 affected and 17 unaffected members in three generations were examined. The peak age of onset was in the second decade. In the youngest generation, the proportion of affected to unaffected individuals at risk significantly differed from the expected 50%. There was slight slowing of conduction velocities in 36% of nerves; however, only 3 out of 10 affected members had entirely normal conduction studies. The amplitude of the sensory potentials of median and peroneal nerves was almost uniformly reduced. In all affected patients electromyography of anterior tibial muscles showed signs of neurogenic involvement. Histological study of two sural nerves and a sciatic nerve and its branches revealed loss of myelinated fibres with a proximal-to-distal gradient in this fibre loss, clusters of small regenerating fibres, and atrophic axons. Postmortem study of the proband showed loss of anterior horn and dorsal root ganglion neurons in the lumbar and sacral segments and degeneration of the fasciculus gracilis. Morphometric evaluation of L5 ventral and dorsal roots revealed a normal number of myelinated fibres, diameter histograms being shifted to the left because of a significant loss of large myelinated fibres and regeneration. These anatomical findings are consistent with the hypothesis that HMSN type II represents a primary neuronopathy affecting motor and sensory neurons.\n",
      "We describe 3 cases of multiple histiocytic cutaneous tumors that began in childhood and affected 3 members from 2 generations of the same family: a mother, a daughter and a nephew. The lesions were mostly skin-colored papules distributed symmetrically on the dorsum of the forearms and hands and on the face and thighs. There were no signs of spontaneous regression. The clinical and histopathological features were consistent with a diagnosis of hereditary progressive mucinous histiocytosis (HPMH), but phenotypic expression varied somewhat between the 3 patients. HPMH has only been described in 8 families to date, and just one of the reports included 3 well-documented cases. Our cases confirm that HPMH can affect males and expands the clinical spectrum of skin lesions in this disease.\n",
      "Three related males presented with a newly recognized x-linked syndrome associated with neurodegeneration, cutaneous abnormalities, and systemic iron overload. Linkage studies demonstrated that they shared a haplotype on Xp21.3-Xp22.2 and exome sequencing was used to identify candidate variants. Of the segregating variants, only a PIGA mutation segregated with disease in the family. The c.328_330delCCT PIGA variant predicts, p.Leu110del (or c.1030_1032delCTT, p.Leu344del depending on the reference sequence). The unaffected great-grandfather shared his X allele with the proband but he did not have the PIGA mutation, indicating that the mutation arose de novo in his daughter. A single family with a germline PIGA mutation has been reported; affected males had a phenotype characterized by multiple congenital anomalies and severe neurologic impairment resulting in infantile lethality. In contrast, affected boys in the family described here were born without anomalies and were neurologically normal prior to onset of seizures after 6 months of age, with two surviving to the second decade. PIGA encodes an enzyme in the GPI anchor biosynthesis pathway. An affected individual in the family studied here was deficient in GPI anchor proteins on granulocytes but not erythrocytes. In conclusion, the PIGA mutation in this family likely causes a reduction in GPI anchor protein cell surface expression in various cell types, resulting in the observed pleiotropic phenotype involving central nervous system, skin, and iron metabolism.\n",
      "Hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSPs) are a group of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by progressive spasticity of the lower limbs. Here, we performed a genome-wide linkage analysis on a consanguineous family presenting an autosomal recessive form of HSP associated with mild mental retardation, brainstem dysraphia, and clinically asymptomatic cerebellar atrophy. We have mapped the disease locus SPG32 to chromosome 14q12-q21 within a 30-cM interval, which excludes the atlastin gene.\n",
      "The combination of palmoplantar keratoderma and woolly hair is uncommon and reported as part of Naxos and Carvajal syndromes, both caused by mutations in desmosomal proteins and associated with cardiomyopathy. We describe two large consanguineous families with autosomal-recessive palmoplantar keratoderma and woolly hair, without cardiomyopathy and with no mutations in any known culprit gene. The aim of this study was to find the mutated gene in these families.Using whole-exome sequencing, we identified a homozygous missense c.2009C>T mutation in KANK2 in the patients (p.Ala670Val). KANK2 encodes the steroid receptor coactivator (SRC)-interacting protein (SIP), an ankyrin repeat containing protein, which sequesters SRCs in the cytoplasm and controls transcription activation of steroid receptors, among others, also of the vitamin D receptor (VDR). The mutation in KANK2 is predicted to abolish the sequestering abilities of SIP. Indeed, vitamin D-induced transactivation was increased in patient's keratinocytes. Furthermore, SRC-2 and SRC-3, coactivators of VDR and important components of epidermal differentiation, are localised to the nucleus of epidermal basal cells in patients, in contrast to the cytoplasmic distribution in the heterozygous control.These findings provide evidence that keratoderma and woolly hair can be caused by a non-desmosomal mechanism and further underline the importance of VDR for normal hair and skin phenotypes.\n",
      "Chromosomal imbalances are a major cause of intellectual disability (ID) and multiple congenital anomalies. We have clinically and molecularly characterized two patients with chromosome translocations and ID. Using whole genome array CGH analysis, we identified a microdeletion involving 4q21.3, unrelated to the translocations in both patients. We confirmed the 4q21.3 microdeletions using fluorescence in situ hybridization and quantitative genomic PCR. The corresponding deletion boundaries in the patients were further mapped and compared to previously reported 4q21 deletions and the associated clinical features. We determined a common region of deletion overlap that appears unique to ID, short stature, hypotonia, and dysmorphic facial features.\n",
      "Two Libyan brothers with achalasia of the cardia, microcephaly, and mental retardation are described. The parents were first cousins and were normal, as were two other male siblings and the female twin of one of the affected brothers. This is the second family to be reported with this constellation of abnormalities. The literature is reviewed for achalasia associated with other pathological conditions.\n",
      "Rickettsialpox is a rare mite-borne rickettsiosis that is encountered in urban populations in the eastern United States and throughout the world. It is characterized clinically by an eschar, fever, and a papulovesicular eruption. Both of these cutaneous manifestations may be mimicked by infectious diseases that have been designated as bioterrorist agents by the United States Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention: the former by anthrax, and the latter by smallpox. It is thus important for clinicians to be familiar with rickettsialpox. We report 3 cases and review the epidemiology, clinical and laboratory findings, differential diagnosis, and management of this disease.\n",
      "Granulomatous slack skin is a rare cutaneous disorder with less than 50 cases presented in the English-language literature. The disease is characterized by circumscribed erythematous lax skin accentuated most commonly in the axillary and inguinal areas. A strong association with a preceding or evolving diagnosis of mycosis fungoides or Hodgkin's disease has been reported. Previous reports describe the entity as a lymphoproliferative disease in the same spectrum as mycosis fungoides and Hodgkin's disease with a monoclonal T-cell population. Our case, without an evident beta-T-cell receptor rearrangement, suggests that not all cases of granulomatous slack skin are a result of an indolent lymphoma. Granulomatous slack skin probably represents a spectrum of diseases that can eventuate into a lymphoproliferative process.\n",
      "A family is described where a mother and three sons have an unusual form of ectodermal dysplasia that may have been described in the medical literature only once before. The unusual manifestations in this family are mild short stature, sparse scalp hair, skin pigmentation and a transient urticarial-like reaction on the hands and arms. The mother and one son demonstrated a single, upper central incisor and the mother and another son had hypoplastic thumbs. The mother alone had hyperkeratosis of the palms and soles. The inheritance pattern is most likely autosomal dominant, although X-linked dominant inheritance cannot be excluded.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical and histopathological features of familial reactive perforating collagenosis (RPC). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ten patients, including affected siblings in three, took part in the study. Parental consanguinity was present in one. Histopathological study was performed in all patients. RESULTS: The eruptions appeared mainly during infancy or early childhood as papules showing a central plug, which subsided within 10 weeks. Areas commonly affected were the face, extremities and trunk. Rare sites were the scalp, ears and buttocks. One pregnant woman, in whom RPC had first manifested around puberty, had relatively widespread lesions. In those with seasonal variation, recurrences were seen a little more frequently in summer than in winter owing to the longer duration of the former. Histopathology confirmed the diagnosis with follicular involvement in four cases. In two patients whose backs were also affected, the lesions went unnoticed, as they were small and inconspicuous. In addition, the brother of a girl with RPC who claimed to be free of the dermatosis, had facial scars suggestive of RPC in the past. CONCLUSIONS: Familial RPC can remain quiescent for a long period and the inherited defect not only shows extreme variability in expression but also demonstrates that lesions can be few and localized so as to escape notice in individuals and family members presenting with this benign, uncommon and self-subsiding dermatosis. In all patients topical retinoic acid was helpful in early regression. Sunscreens may mitigate the severity of RPC in those whose lesions are precipitated in summer but this needs further evaluation.\n",
      "A new syndrome is described, affecting four persons in one family; it includes multiple non-erupting teeth with cementum defects, hypoplasia of the alveolar process and the maxillo-zygomatical region, genua valga and ear deformities. An autosomal recessive trait could be ascertained.\n",
      "L-serine plays an essential role in neuronal development and function. Although a non-essential amino acid, L-serine must be synthesised within the brain because of its poor permeability by the blood-brain barrier. Within the brain, its synthesis is confined to astrocytes, and its shuttle to neuronal cells is performed by a dedicated neutral amino acid transporter, ASCT1.Using exome analysis we identified the recessive mutations, p.E256K, p.L315fs, and p.R457W, in SLC1A4, the gene encoding ASCT1, in patients with developmental delay, microcephaly and hypomyelination; seizure disorder was variably present. When expressed in a heterologous system, the mutations did not affect the protein level at the plasma membrane but abolished or markedly reduced L-serine transport for p.R457W and p.E256K mutations, respectively. Interestingly, p.E256K mutation displayed a lower L-serine and alanine affinity but the same substrate selectivity as wild-type ASCT1.The clinical phenotype of ASCT1 deficiency is reminiscent of defects in L-serine biosynthesis. The data underscore that ASCT1 is essential in brain serine transport. The SLC1A4 p.E256K mutation has a carrier frequency of 0.7% in the Ashkenazi-Jewish population and should be added to the carrier screening panel in this community.\n",
      "Vitamin B2, riboflavin is essential for cellular function, as it participates in a diversity of redox reactions central to human metabolism, through its role as precursor for the cofactors flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), which are electron carriers. The electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF) and its dehydrogenase (ETFDH), uses FAD as cofactor. The ETF and ETFDH are forming the electron transport pathway for many mitochondrial flavoprotein dehydrogenases involved in fatty acid, amino acid and choline metabolism. A variation in either ETF or ETFDH causes multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenation deficiency (MADD), but genetic variations in the riboflavin metabolism or transportation of riboflavin can also cause MADD. The most common variations are located in the riboflavin transporter 2 (RFVT2) and 3 (RFVT3), that are highly expressed in brain and intestinal tissues, respectively. Deficiency of riboflavin transporter 1 (RFVT1), encoded by the SLC52A1 gene, highly expressed in the placenta, has only been reported once. We here report a case of transient MADD, caused by a heterozygous intronic variation, c.1134+11G>A, in the SLC52A1 gene encoding RFVT1. This variation creates a binding site for the splice inhibitory hnRNP A1 protein and causes exon 4 skipping. Riboflavin deficiency and maternal malnutrition during pregnancy might have been the determining factor in the outcome of this case.\n",
      "Three elderly sisters with profound mental retardation in association with the clinical features of microcephaly, short stature, brachydactyly type D, flattened occiput, down-slanting palpebral fissures, low-set large ears, broad prominent nose and kyphoscoliosis have been investigated. Each was more than 60 years of age and their clinical features were strikingly similar. The disorder has several manifestations in common with Rubenstein-Taybi syndrome and appears to be inherited as an autosomal recessive in this family.\n",
      "In 1966, Mietens and Weber reported four out of six siblings from a consanguineous couple with growth failure, dislocation of the head of the radii, bilateral flexion contracture of the elbows, short ulnae and radii, bilateral corneal opacities, horizontal and rotational nystagmus, strabismus, small, pointed nose and mild to moderate mental retardation. Since then, only three other cases have been reported. We report on two new cases, a pair of female twins aged 9 years. The patients were born after an uneventful, normal pregnancy, to young and non-consanguineous parents. After birth, physical findings included horizontal nystagmus and dislocation of both elbows because of abnormally short radii and ulnae in both twins. Further clinical examinations showed moderate psychomotor delay with marked language compromise. Karyotypes were normal in both girls. A review of the literature reveals that the Mietens-Weber syndrome is an uncommon disorder with a probable autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. To our best knowledge, including the two cases reported here, only nine cases have been observed so far. The finding of congenital nystagmus and radii dislocation in a patient with mental retardation is probably nonrandom and is highly suggestive of Mietens-Weber syndrome.\n",
      "Mitochondrial protein translation is a complex process performed within mitochondria by an apparatus composed of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-encoded RNAs and nuclear DNA-encoded proteins. Although the latter by far outnumber the former, the vast majority of mitochondrial translation defects in humans have been associated with mutations in RNA-encoding mtDNA genes, whereas mutations in protein-encoding nuclear genes have been identified in a handful of cases. Genetic investigation involving patients with defective mitochondrial translation led us to the discovery of novel mutations in the mitochondrial elongation factor G1 (EFG1) in one affected baby and, for the first time, in the mitochondrial elongation factor Tu (EFTu) in another one. Both patients were affected by severe lactic acidosis and rapidly progressive, fatal encephalopathy. The EFG1-mutant patient had early-onset Leigh syndrome, whereas the EFTu-mutant patient had severe infantile macrocystic leukodystrophy with micropolygyria. Structural modeling enabled us to make predictions about the effects of the mutations at the molecular level. Yeast and mammalian cell systems proved the pathogenic role of the mutant alleles by functional complementation in vivo. Nuclear-gene abnormalities causing mitochondrial translation defects represent a new, potentially broad field of mitochondrial medicine. Investigation of these defects is important to expand the molecular characterization of mitochondrial disorders and also may contribute to the elucidation of the complex control mechanisms, which regulate this fundamental pathway of mtDNA homeostasis.\n",
      "We describe a family in which eight persons (three males, five females) in three generations had a syndrome of bilateral and strikingly symmetrical triphalangeal thumbs and radial hypoplasia. The affected males also had a first-degree hypospadias and all affected family members had an anterior maxillary diastema. The syndrome was inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion.\n",
      "Desmoplakin is the major linker in desmosomes in epithelia and myocardium, anchoring intermediate filaments by the C-terminus to plakoglobin and plakophilin in the desmosomal plaque. Mutations in the gene DSP encoding desmoplakin have been associated with various phenotypes affecting skin and/or heart. One of these phenotypes, lethal acantholytic epidermolysis bullosa (LAEB), is characterized by extensive postnatal shedding of epidermis leading to early demise and is caused by recessive mutations in the gene DSP resulting in truncation of the desmoplakin C-terminus. Here we describe two infants born to the same consanguinous parents who suffered extensive epidermal dislodgment and died shortly after birth. In addition, universal alopecia, anonychia, malformed ears and cardiomyopathy were observed. As the clinical diagnosis was LAEB, DSP mutation analysis was performed. A homozygous deletion (c.2874del5) abrogating the donor splice site of exon 20 was found. The deletion is predicted to cause read-through in intron 20 with subsequent recognition of a premature termination codon, resulting in desmoplakin lacking its rod domain and C-terminus (p.Lys959MetfsX5). Electron microscopic analysis of skin biopsies showed absence of the desmosomal inner dense plaque and lack of tonofilament insertion. This is the second report of LAEB. These findings suggest DSP mutations as the aetiology of LAEB and cardiomyopathy as part of the phenotype. Furthermore, they indicate that in addition to the desmoplakin C-terminus, the rod domain is dispensable for intrauterine development but is essential for the inner dense plaque of desmosomes.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: The genetic complexity of infantile cardiomyopathies is remarkable, and the importance of mitochondrial translation defects as a causative factor is only starting to be recognised. We investigated the genetic basis for infantile onset recessive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in two siblings. METHODS AND RESULTS: Analysis of respiratory chain enzymes revealed a combined deficiency of complexes I and IV in the heart and skeletal muscle. Exome sequencing uncovered a homozygous mutation (L156R) in MRPL44 of both siblings. MRPL44 encodes a protein in the large subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome and is suggested to locate in close proximity to the tunnel exit of the yeast mitochondrial ribosome. We found severely reduced MRPL44 levels in the patient's heart, skeletal muscle and fibroblasts suggesting that the missense mutation affected the protein stability. In patient fibroblasts, decreased MRPL44 affected assembly of the large ribosomal subunit and stability of 16S rRNA leading to complex IV deficiency. Despite this assembly defect, de novo mitochondrial translation was only mildly affected in fibroblasts suggesting that MRPL44 may have a function in the assembly/stability of nascent mitochondrial polypeptides exiting the ribosome. Retroviral expression of wild-type MRPL44 in patient fibroblasts rescued the large ribosome assembly defect and COX deficiency. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that mitochondrial ribosomal subunit defects can generate tissue-specific manifestations, such as cardiomyopathy.\n",
      "The SOX5 haploinsufficiency syndrome is characterized by global developmental delay, intellectual disability, language and motor impairment, and distinct facial features. The smallest deletion encompassed only one gene, SOX5 (OMIM 604975), indicating that haploinsufficiency of SOX5 contributes to neuro developmental delay. Although multiple deletions of the SOX5 gene have been reported in patients, none are strictly intragenic point mutations. Here, we report the identification of a de novo loss of function variant in SOX5 identified through whole exome sequencing. The proband presented with moderate developmental delay, bilateral optic atrophy, mildly dysmorphic features, and scoliosis, which correlates with the previously-described SOX5-associated phenotype. These results broaden the diagnostic spectrum of SOX5-related intellectual disability. Furthermore it highlights the utility of exome sequencing in establishing an etiological basis in clinically and genetically heterogeneous conditions such as intellectual disability.\n",
      "Two half-brothers by the same mother presented with the Robin sequence and facial and digital anomalies. The mother has a normal face and mild hyperopia without abnormality on radiographs of the hands, feet, and pelvis. The older son is 4 years and the younger is 6 months old. Both have normal psychomotor development. To the best of our knowledge this familial association has not been reported before and probably represents a previously unrecognized heritable malformation syndrome. The occurrence of the syndrome in 2 half-brothers by the same unaffected mother suggests X-linked recessive inheritance.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To define the phenotypic manifestation, confirm the genetic basis, and delineate the pathogenic mechanisms underlying an oculoauricular syndrome (OAS). METHODS: Two individuals from a consanguineous family underwent comprehensive clinical phenotyping and electrodiagnostic testing (EDT). Genome-wide microarray analysis and Sanger sequencing of the candidate gene were used to identify the likely causal variant. Protein modelling, Western blotting, and dual luciferase assays were used to assess the pathogenic effect of the variant in vitro. RESULTS: Complex developmental ocular abnormalities of congenital cataract, anterior segment dysgenesis, iris coloboma, early-onset retinal dystrophy, and abnormal external ear cartilage presented in the affected family members. Genetic analyses identified a homozygous c.650A>C; p.(Gln217Pro) missense mutation within the highly conserved homeodomain of the H6 family homeobox 1 (HMX1) gene. Protein modelling predicts that the variant may have a detrimental effect on protein folding and/or stability. In vitro analyses were able to demonstrate that the mutation has no effect on protein expression but adversely alters function. CONCLUSIONS: Oculoauricular syndrome is an autosomal recessive condition that has a profound effect on the development of the external ear, anterior segment, and retina, leading to significant visual loss at an early age. This study has delineated the phenotype and confirmed HMX1 as the gene causative of OAS, enabling the description of only the second family with the condition. HMX1 is a key player in ocular development, possibly in both the pathway responsible for lens and retina development, and via the gene network integral to optic fissure closure.\n",
      "Chromosome 17p13.3 is a gene rich region that when deleted is associated with the well-known Miller-Dieker syndrome. A recently described duplication syndrome involving this region has been associated with intellectual impairment, autism and occasional brain MRI abnormalities. We report 34 additional patients from 21 families to further delineate the clinical, neurological, behavioral, and brain imaging findings. We found a highly diverse phenotype with inter- and intrafamilial variability, especially in cognitive development. The most specific phenotype occurred in individuals with large duplications that include both the YWHAE and LIS1 genes. These patients had a relatively distinct facial phenotype and frequent structural brain abnormalities involving the corpus callosum, cerebellar vermis, and cranial base. Autism spectrum disorders were seen in a third of duplication probands, most commonly in those with duplications of YWHAE and flanking genes such as CRK. The typical neurobehavioral phenotype was usually seen in those with the larger duplications. We did not confirm the association of early overgrowth with involvement of YWHAE and CRK, or growth failure with duplications of LIS1. Older patients were often overweight. Three variant phenotypes included cleft lip/palate (CLP), split hand/foot with long bone deficiency (SHFLD), and a connective tissue phenotype resembling Marfan syndrome. The duplications in patients with clefts appear to disrupt ABR, while the SHFLD phenotype was associated with duplication of BHLHA9 as noted in two recent reports. The connective tissue phenotype did not have a convincing critical region. Our experience with this large cohort expands knowledge of this diverse duplication syndrome.\n",
      "Multifocal lymphangioendotheliomatosis with thrombocytopenia (MLT) is a recently described glucose transporter 1-negative multifocal vascular disorder with significant morbidity and mortality. However, data are lacking on the clinical spectrum, long-term prognosis, and treatment of MLT. It is often confused with multifocal infantile hemangioma, but the conditions must be differentiated for appropriate assessment and therapeutic management. Treatments for MLT have been disappointing, and the treatments classically used for infantile hemangioma are often ineffective. We report 3 newborn cases featuring various clinical and biological phenotypes of MLT: 1 patient had severe brain involvement and died early; another had no thrombocytopenia; and the third had nearly no skin involvement. Histologically, all were negative for glucose transporter 1 and positive for the lymphatic marker lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor 1 or D2-40 (‚àº38-kDa O-linked transmembrane sialoglycoprotein podoplanin). Two cases with severe gastrointestinal bleeding were treated with sirolimus 0.1 mg/k per day, which was efficient after the first month of treatment. MLT clinically presents in various forms, and when complicated by widespread or severe extracutaneous involvement, initial aggressive therapeutic intervention is justified. The pathogenesis of MLT remains unclear, but lymphatic differentiation is widely acknowledged. Because of its antiangiogenic properties, including anti-lymphangiogenesis, sirolimus offers an adequate and targeted therapeutic approach for MLT.\n",
      "Neuroectodermal melanolysosomal disease, also known as Elejalde syndrome, is a rare syndrome characterized by silvery hair, pigment abnormalities, and profound central nervous system dysfunction. It is similar to the Chediak-Higashi and Griscelli syndromes, although these syndromes are associated with severe immunologic dysfunction. We report on a 12-year-old male with Elejalde syndrome and compare the Elejalde, Chediak-Higashi, and Griscelli syndromes.\n",
      "We have identified two families with a previously undescribed lethal X-linked disorder of infancy; the disorder comprises a distinct combination of an aged appearance, craniofacial anomalies, hypotonia, global developmental delays, cryptorchidism, and cardiac arrhythmias. Using X chromosome exon sequencing and a recently developed probabilistic algorithm aimed at discovering disease-causing variants, we identified in one family a c.109T>C (p.Ser37Pro) variant in NAA10, a gene encoding the catalytic subunit of the major human N-terminal acetyltransferase (NAT). A parallel effort on a second unrelated family converged on the same variant. The absence of this variant in controls, the amino acid conservation of this region of the protein, the predicted disruptive change, and the co-occurrence in two unrelated families with the same rare disorder suggest that this is the pathogenic mutation. We confirmed this by demonstrating a significantly impaired biochemical activity of the mutant hNaa10p, and from this we conclude that a reduction in acetylation by hNaa10p causes this disease. Here we provide evidence of a human genetic disorder resulting from direct impairment of N-terminal acetylation, one of the most common protein modifications in humans.\n",
      "Alopecia with mental retardation syndrome (APMR) is a very rare autosomal recessive condition that is associated with total or partial absence of hair from the scalp and other parts of the body as well as variable intellectual disability. Here we present whole-exome sequencing results of a large consanguineous family segregating APMR syndrome with seven affected family members. Our study revealed a novel predicted pathogenic, homozygous missense mutation in the AHSG (OMIM 138680) gene (AHSG: NM_001622:exon7:c.950G>A:p.Arg317His). The variant is predicted to affect a region of the protein required for protein processing and disrupts a phosphorylation motif. In addition, the altered protein migrates with an aberrant size relative to healthy individuals. Consistent with the phenotype, AHSG maps within APMR linkage region 1 (APMR 1) as reported before, and falls within runs of homozygosity (ROH). Previous families with APMR syndrome have been studied through linkage analyses and the linkage resolution did not allow pointing out to a single gene candidate. Our study is the first report to identify a homozygous missense mutation for APMR syndrome through whole-exome sequencing.\n",
      "Holoprosencephaly (HPE) and craniosynostosis are separate conditions that have occasionally been observed to occur simultaneously in the same patient. Here, we compile patients with both conditions who have been documented in the literature thus far; moreover, we report on two additional siblings who have not been previously described. We also compare the clinical features of these patients and discuss the previously hypothesized possibility of an independent association including both HPE and craniosynostosis.\n",
      "A new type of non-specific X linked mental retardation is described in a three generation family. The three affected males had severe mental retardation (IQ 20 to 30), mutism, growth failure, frequent infections, seizures, and the following minor anomalies: brachycephaly, frontal hair whorl, square face, large mouth, thick lips, and prognathism. There was not a characteristic facies. Normal laboratory studies on the proband included a karyotype with fragile X screening, skeletal survey, blood amino acid, urine organic acid, and HGPRT levels. Linkage analysis was performed with 10 X chromosome DNA probes of which probe DXS255 at chromosomal region Xp11.22 gave a maximal two point lod score of 2.10 if phase was inferred and 1.20 if it was not. Crossovers were shown with probes mapping to regions Xp22, Xp21, and Xq28. Comparison of these patients with 80 X linked causes of mental retardation, including 41 which might be classified as 'non-specific', showed no other disorders compatible with the phenotypic and linkage data.\n",
      "Congenital erosive and vesicular dermatosis with reticulated supple scarring is a rare cutaneous disorder of unknown aetiology first described by Cohen and colleagues in 1985. It classically presents in the neonate as erosions and vesicles that heal within the first months of life, with supple scarring of a reticulated pattern. Along with a review of the literature, this article presents two atypical cases of congenital erosive and vesicular dermatosis with reticulated supple scarring. Patient one presented with neither erosions nor vesicles at birth, yet continued to experience sporadic blistering at the age of 15√Ç¬†months and patient two is the second documented case to develop congenital erosive and vesicular dermatosis after birth.\n",
      "Mutations in the CRYAB gene, encoding alpha-B crystallin, cause distinct clinical phenotypes including isolated posterior polar cataract, myofibrillar myopathy, cardiomyopathy, or a multisystemic disorder combining all these features. Genotype/phenotype correlations are still unclear. To date, multisystemic involvement has been reported only in kindred harboring the R120G substitution. We report a novel CRYAB mutation, D109H, associated with posterior polar cataract, myofibrillar myopathy and cardiomyopathy in a two-generation family with five affected individuals. Age of onset, clinical presentation, and muscle abnormalities were very similar to those described in the R120G family. Alpha-B crystallin may form dimers and acts as a chaperone for a number of proteins. It has been suggested that the phenotypic diversity could be related to the various interactions between target proteins of individual mutant residues. Molecular modeling indicates that residues D109 and R120 interact with each other during dimerization of alpha-B crystallin; interestingly, the two substitutions affecting these residues (D109H and R120G) are associated with the same clinical phenotype, thus suggesting a similar pathogenic mechanism. We propose that impairment of alpha-B crystallin dimerization may also be relevant to the pathogenesis of these disorders.\n",
      "Pierpont syndrome (OMIM #602342) is a rare disorder characterized by developmental delay, characteristic facial gestalt, hearing loss, and abnormal fat distribution in the distal limbs. A specific mutation in TBL1XR1 [c.1337A>G; p.(Tyr446Cys)] has been described recently in six unrelated patients with Pierpont syndrome. We report on a male child with developmental delay, distinctive facial dysmorphic features, dystrophy, and abnormal fat distribution in the feet, in whom we identified the identical TBL1XR1 mutation. This patient also had additional clinical features including microphthalmia, pendular nystagmus, cryptorchidism, dermal sinus, and peripheral joint laxity, which had not been reported previously in association with Pierpont syndrome. This patient corroborates the assumption that Pierpont syndrome is exclusively caused by the specific TBL1XR1 missense mutation p.(Tyr446Cys) and the additional features broaden the phenotypic spectrum of this rare disorder.\n",
      "We report on two unrelated male infants with similar findings of communicating hydrocephalus, endocardial fibroelastosis (EFE) and congenital cataracts, who died at 4 months of age. Both mothers reported an upper respiratory infection during the first trimester of pregnancy which was further complicated by polyhydramnios in the third trimester. The infants were diagnosed with bilateral congenital nuclear cataracts at birth. Serologic tests for toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, syphilis, and galactosemia screens were negative. Chromosome analyses were normal. Both children developed communicating hydrocephalus between one and three months after birth. Patient 1 died suddenly at 4 months following an upper respiratory infection. Patient 2 developed congestive heart failure and also died at 4 months. At autopsy, both infants had enlarged hearts with endocardial fibroelastosis. No identifiable organism could be isolated. We discuss the association of birth defects in widely separated organ systems in these patients and suggest that this may represent a genetic syndrome; however, a viral etiology cannot entirely be excluded. We believe this is a distinct disorder and propose the acronym HEC for hydrocephalus, EFE and cataracts.\n",
      "Cole-Carpenter syndrome is a severe bone fragility disorder that is characterized by frequent fractures, craniosynostosis, ocular proptosis, hydrocephalus, and distinctive facial features. To identify the cause of Cole-Carpenter syndrome in the two individuals whose clinical results were presented in the original description of this disorder, we performed whole-exome sequencing of genomic DNA samples from both individuals. The two unrelated individuals had the same heterozygous missense mutation in exon 9 of P4HB (NM_000918.3: c.1178A>G [p.Tyr393Cys]), the gene that encodes protein disulfide isomerase (PDI). In one individual, the P4HB mutation had arisen de novo, whereas in the other the mutation was transmitted from the clinically unaffected father who was a mosaic carrier of the variant. The mutation was located in the C-terminal disulfide isomerase domain of PDI, sterically close to the enzymatic center, and affected disulfide isomerase activity in vitro. Skin fibroblasts showed signs of increased endoplasmic reticulum stress, but despite the reported importance of PDI for collagen type I production, the rate of collagen type I secretion appeared normal. In conclusion, Cole-Carpenter syndrome is caused by a specific de novo mutation in P4HB that impairs the disulfide isomerase activity of PDI.\n",
      "Spondyloperipheral dysplasia (SPD; OMIM 271700) is an autosomal dominant connective tissue disorder characterized by vertebral body abnormalities (platyspondyly, end-plate indentations), hip dysplasia and brachydactyly type E. Here, we identified a novel truncating mutation (p.Lys1444AsnfsX27) in the C-propeptide of type II collagen in an affected Chinese individual with SPD. Our findings will provide clues to the phenotype-genotype relations and may assist not only in the clinical diagnosis of SPD but also in the interpretation of genetic information used for prenatal diagnosis and genetic counseling.\n",
      "Congenital disorders of manganese metabolism are rare occurrences in children, and medical management of these disorders is complex and challenging. Homozygous exonic mutations in the manganese transporter SLC39A14 have recently been associated with a pediatric-onset neurodegenerative disorder characterized by brain manganese accumulation and clinical signs of manganese neurotoxicity, including parkinsonism-dystonia. We performed whole exome sequencing on DNA samples from two unrelated female children from the United Arab Emirates with progressive movement disorder and brain mineralization, identified a novel homozygous intronic mutation in SLC39A14 in both children, and demonstrated that the mutation leads to aberrant splicing. Both children had consistently elevated serum manganese levels and were diagnosed with SLC39A14-associated manganism. Over a four-year period, we utilized a multidisciplinary management approach for Patient 1 combining decreased manganese dietary intake and chelation with symptomatic management of dystonia. Our treatment strategy appeared to slow disease progression, but did not lead to a cure or reversal of already established deficits. Clinicians should consider testing for noncoding mutations in the diagnosis of congenital disorders of manganese metabolism and utilizing multidisciplinary approaches in the management of these disorders.\n",
      "We report a Portuguese family with familial amyloid polyneuropathy related to gelsolin. There were no known Finnish ancestors, but the same mutation as described in Finnish patients (G654A) was carried. Clinical and neurophysiological investigations were performed in four patients. Corneal lattice dystrophy affected all four patients; an axonal lesion of the facial nerve occurred in three patients; visual tract involvement was documented in one case; and corticospinal and posterior column dysfunction was present in one patient. Polarizing microscopy of skin and muscle samples demonstrated amyloid deposits in two patients; anti-gelsolin immunohistochemistry was positive for amyloidogenic gelsolin. The Finnish mutation of gelsolin protein (G654A) was detected in five family members. The utility of neurophysiological testing in the evaluation and follow-up of this type of amyloidosis is discussed.\n",
      "Dental agenesis is either syndromic or non-syndromic. Here, we describe a familial case with Carvajal/Naxos syndrome associating woolly hair, palmoplantar keratoderma, and biventricular dilated cardiomyopathy. In addition to these signs, all three affected family members had hypo/oligodontia ranging from absence of the lower left second molar to 15 missing teeth, the typical pattern of oligodontia being absent 2nd premolars and absent 2nd and 3rd molars. Mutation screening in the desmoplakin gene (DSP) revealed a de novo missense mutation (c.1790 C>T, p.Ser597Leu) changing a serine residue conserved in all vertebrates. In addition, this variation was absent from 100 control DNA samples. There were no mutations in the plakoglobin gene. This familial case report and two other previous reports demonstrate that autosomal-dominant mutations in the DSP gene are associated with hypo/oligodontia in the setting of Carvajal/Naxos syndrome. This study suggests that dentists discovering oligo/hypodontia should screen for woolly hair and palmoplantar keratoderma because of the probable cardiac involvement with an inherent high risk of severe cardiomyopathy. In addition, this study reveals the role of desmosomes in the development of teeth and suggests that other genes encoding proteins of the desmosome could be involved in oligo/hypodontia.\n",
      "Lateral meningocele syndrome (LMS) is a rare hereditary connective tissue disorder characterized by pan-spinal meningoceles, specific facial dysmorphism, skeletal and soft tissue abnormalities, and hypotonia and/or muscle weakness. LMS has been observed in eleven patients with two instances of vertical transmission, and seven sporadic cases with an age at diagnosis ranging from 25 months to 33 years. We report on a further observation of LMS in a 55-year-old woman presenting with a long history of joint instability, chronic musculoskeletal pain, and iatrogenic bladder and anorectal dysfunction due to irreversible nerve damage after surgical excision of a meningeal cyst. Her clinical characteristics are compared with those of previously reported patients, as well as two further cases originally diagnosed with Hajdu-Cheney and Ehlers-Danlos syndromes, but displaying typical features of LMS.\n",
      "Congenital bony fusion of the maxilla and mandible is a rare condition. Two classifications were previously proposed dealing exclusively with craniofacial malformations. Most of the reported cases to date represent either aglossia-adactylia or hemifacial microsomia syndromes. We report a young girl with bony syngnathia associated with multiple defects (severe microcephaly, coloboma, vertebral segmentation defects), growth and mental delay. This patient is very similar to the patient described by Dobrow in 1983 and confirms the existence of this extremely rare disorder.\n",
      "Although glycogen storage disease type 0 (GSD0) is included in the differential diagnosis of ketotic hypoglycemia, it usually is not considered in the evaluation of glucosuria or hyperglycemia. We describe two children with GSD0, confirmed by mutation analysis, who had glucosuria and hyperglycemia. Because of the variable presentation of this disorder and previous dependence on liver biopsy to confirm diagnosis, it is likely that GSD0 is underdiagnosed.\n",
      "We report the first case of inherited ring chromosome 8 syndrome without loss of subtelomeric sequences. The proband is a 6 1/2-year-old boy with short stature, microcephaly, mild mental retardation, and behavioral problems including hyperactivity and attention deficit. His mother presented the same physical features but intelligence was normal. Family history also revealed an uncle and a grandmother, with short stature and microcephaly. Moderate mental retardation was reported in the uncle. Karyotypes and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses were performed on peripheral blood lymphocytes for both child and mother. The child's karyotype was reported as 46,XY,r(8)(p23q24.3)[24]/45,XY,-8[2] and the mother's karyotype 46,XX,r(8)(p23q24.3)[22]/45,XX,-8[2]/47,XX,r(8)(p23q24.3), +r(8)(p23q24.3)[1]. FISH studies showed no deletion of subtelomeric sequences for both child and mother indicating that no or little chromosomal euchromatic material has been deleted. These findings indicate that ring chromosome 8 without loss of subtelomeric sequences can be inherited and that carriers in a same family present with cognitive function ranging from mild mental retardation to normal intelligence.\n",
      "We report on a sister and brother with severe mental retardation, bulbous tip of the nose, long columella, cleft lip and palate, heart and intestinal anomalies, and growth retardation. This appears to be a previously unreported, autosomal recessive condition, given high resolution prometaphase chromosomes are normal.\n",
      "We report on a boy with unique somatic and skeletal manifestations. The syndrome consists of mental retardation, postaxial polydactyly, phalangeal hypoplasia, 2-3 toe syndactyly, abnormal face and uncombable hair. A younger sib who died soon after the birth was probably also affected.\n",
      "Three siblings from Morocco consanguineous family presented with cutaneous poikiloderma following postnatal ichthyosiform lesions, associated with papillomatous lesions, palmoplantar keratoderma, pachyonychia of toenails, fragile carious teeth, and lachrymal duct obstruction. Photosensitivity and blistering improved with age. Atrophic scars were prominent on the limbs. Neutropenia developed in the first year secondary to dysmyelopoiesis affecting the granulocyte lineage, associated with a polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia. Several broncho-pulmonary infectious episodes complicated the evolution, and cystic fibrosis was first considered on the basis of repeated abnormal sweat chloride tests but not confirmed by molecular analyses. This autosomal recessive disorder matches that described originally as poikiloderma with neutropenia-Clericuzio type in Navajo Indians (OMIM 604173). It is discussed within the group of the major hereditary poikiloderma disorders, that is, Rothmund-Thomson syndrome, dyskeratosis congenita, and Kindler syndrome.\n",
      "The ciliopathies represent an umbrella group of >50 clinical entities that share both clinical features and molecular etiology underscored by structural and functional defects of the primary cilium. Despite the advances in gene discovery, this group of entities continues to pose a diagnostic challenge, in part due to significant genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity and variability. We consulted a pediatric case from asymptomatic, non-consanguineous parents who presented as a suspected ciliopathy due to a constellation of retinal, renal, and skeletal findings.Although clinical panel sequencing of genes implicated in nephrotic syndromes yielded no likely causal mutation, an oligo-SNP microarray identified a ~20-Mb region of homozygosity, with no altered gene dosage, on chromosome 16p13. Intersection of the proband's phenotypes with known disease genes within the homozygous region yielded a single candidate, IFT140, encoding a retrograde intraflagellar transport protein implicated previously in several ciliopathies, including the phenotypically overlapping Mainzer-Saldino syndrome (MZSDS). Sanger sequencing yielded a maternally inherited homozygous c.634G>A; p.Gly212Arg mutation altering the exon 6 splice donor site. Functional studies in cells from the proband showed that the locus produced two transcripts: a majority message containing a mis-splicing event that caused a premature termination codon and a minority message homozygous for the p.Gly212Arg allele. Zebrafish in vivo complementation studies of the latter transcript demonstrated a loss of function effect. Finally, we conducted post-hoc trio-based whole exome sequencing studies to (a) test the possibility of other causal loci in the proband and (b) explain the Mendelian error of segregation for the IFT140 mutation. We show that the proband harbors a chromosome 16 maternal heterodisomy, with segmental isodisomy at 16p13, likely due to a meiosis I error in the maternal gamete.Using clinical phenotyping combined with research-based genetic and functional studies, we have characterized a recurrent IFT140 mutation in the proband; together, these data are consistent with MZSDS. Additionally, we report a rare instance of a uniparental isodisomy unmasking a deleterious mutation to cause a ciliary disorder.\n",
      "The genetic heterogeneity of developmental delay and cognitive impairment is vast. The endocytic network is essential for neural development and synaptic plasticity by regulating the sorting of numerous transmembrane proteins. Disruption of the pathway can lead to neuronal pathology. Endosomal biogenesis relies on two Rab proteins, Rab5 and Rab7, which bind to two hexameric tethering complexes, the endosomal class C core vacuole/endosome tethering complex (CORVET) and the late endosomal/lysosomal homotypic fusion and protein sorting complex (HOPS). Both complexes consist of four core proteins and differ by their specific Rab-binding proteins.To identify the molecular basis of a neurological disease, which consists of global developmental stagnation at 3-8 months, increasing appendicular spasticity, truncal hypotonia and acquired microcephaly, with variable seizure disorder, accompanied by thin corpus callosum, paucity of white matter and delayed myelination in eight patients from four unrelated Ashkenazi-Jewish (AJ) families.Exome analysis, homozygosity mapping and Mup1-GFP transport assay in mutant yeast.Homozygosity for a missense mutation, p.Cys846Gly, in one of the endosomal biogenesis core proteins, VPS11, was identified in all the patients. This was shown to be a founder mutation with a carrier frequency of 0.6% in the AJ population. The homologous yeast mutant had moderate impairment of fusion of the late endosome to the vacuole in Mup1-GFP transport assay.We speculate that in neuronal cells, impairment of fusion of the late endosome to the vacuole would attenuate the degradation of plasma membrane receptors, thereby underlying the progressive neuronal phenotype in our patients. The VPS11 p.Cys846Gly mutation should be added to the AJ carrier screening panel.\n",
      "Pfeiffer-type cardiocranial syndrome (MIM 218450) was first delineated in 1987; several further patients have been reported confirming this as a distinct nosological entity. The aetiology of this condition remains unknown although an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance has been suggested following the description of sib pairs. A patient is described with features of this condition including sagittal suture synostosis, growth retardation, learning difficulties, hypertelorism, low-set ears, micrognathia, congenital heart defects and genital anomalies. Telomere studies on blood and skin samples identified a de novo unbalanced rearrangement resulting in partial monosomy for 1p36.1 to pter and partial trisomy for 17q25.1 to qter. This case provides the first insight into the possible aetiology of this condition.\n",
      "Crouzon syndrome with acanthosis nigricans (CAN) is a very rare condition with an approximate prevalence of 1 per 1 million newborns. We add the first report on prenatal 2D and 3D ultrasound findings in CAN. In addition we present the postnatal 3D CT findings. The diagnosis was confirmed by molecular testing.\n",
      "We present a case of infantile myofibromatosis of the lung detected at 32 weeks' gestation. The fetus was monitored with weekly ultrasound examinations measuring the mass size and amniotic fluid index. On day 2 after delivery, due to respiratory distress, an exploratory thoracotomy was undertaken and the mass was resected.\n",
      "Pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP), also known as jelly belly, is a rare condition with mucinous material spread throughout the abdomen. It can arise from the appendix, colon, or even a teratoma. The documented incidence is one per million per year. We present a case report of an 80-year-old female patient presenting with PMP secondary to an appendicular tumor leading to localized infiltration, and perforation of the cecal wall. A review of the literature was carried out, with emphasis on various treatment options available for this rare condition.\n",
      "X-linked hydrocephalus (XLH) has an incidence of 1/30,000 male births and is characterized by intellectual disability, spastic paraplegia, adducted thumbs, and agenesis of corpus callosum, and/or corticospinal tract. The great proportion of cases is ascribed to loss of function mutations of L1CAM gene. Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) is characterized by the absence of ganglion cells in the submucosal and myenteric plexuses along a variable portion of the intestinal tract and has incidence of about 1/5,000. Although with several genes involved in its pathogenesis, the major HSCR gene is the RET proto-oncogene. To date only a few patients have been reported with both phenotypes and mutations in the L1CAM gene. In this report, we describe a new patient with concurrent XLH and HSCR. L1CAM mutational screening showed the presence of the G698R hemizygous mutation, which is a deleterious substitution affecting a key residue necessary for the correct folding of the protein. Moreover, the patient also carried the transcriptional enhancer RET mutation (c.73‚Äâ+‚Äâ9277T‚Äâ>‚ÄâC) in heterozygosis. We speculate that both the RET enhancer variant, and the L1CAM mutation may act in combination to produce the enteric phenotype, probably with the participation of other still unidentified molecular events. While it is obvious that additional studies are necessary to further delineate the association between XLH and HSCR in the presence of L1CAM mutations, the documentation of this new patient reinforces the role of this gene acting either in a direct or indirect way in the pathogenesis of Hirschsprung disease.\n",
      "We report on two patients with a severe form of spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia (SEMD). Both patients show normal birth length, early postnatal growth deficiency, severe short stature, flexion contractures in the hips, bowing of the legs with genu varum. Skeletal radiographies show platyspondyly and characteristic vertebral body shape with central indentation of endplates, progressive, and severe metaphyseal changes, very small and irregular proximal femoral epiphyses with severe coxa vara, absence of calcifications, and mild metaphyseal irregularities in upper limbs. The similarities in the skeletal radiographs with SEMD type Strudwick and SEMD matrilin 3 type prompted us to analyze the COL2A1 and MATN3 genes. Direct sequencing of genomic DNA failed to identify any mutation in COL2A1 for both patients and MATN3 sequencing for Patient 1 identified only one heterozygous variant with no predicted damaging effect inherited from an unaffected parent. We therefore conclude that this form of SEMD probably differs from SEMD matrilin 3 type and does not belong to the spectrum of type II collagenopathies. The similarities between our two patients allowed us to propose that they might show a new form of SEMD.\n",
      "Three unrelated Puerto Rican boys, ranging in age from 3 to 4 years, had marked, central, non-progressive hypotonia, chronic constipation, severe psychomotor retardation, seizures or abnormal electroencephalograph or both, abnormal dermatoglyphics, delayed bone age, dysharmonic skeletal maturation, and preponderance and larger size of type 2 muscle fibres. Additional findings included narrow, high arched palate, prominent nasal root, long philtrum, distended abdomen, and drooling from open mouth. Two of the three patients also had undescended testes, hypertelorism, and tapered fingers. Birth weight, postnatal physical growth, and head size were average. Family and gestational histories and laboratory evaluations were normal. The combination of features observed in the three boys appears to be distinct and to represent a new syndrome.\n",
      "The 8p23.1 duplication syndrome is a relatively rare genomic condition that has been confirmed with molecular cytogenetic methods in only 11 probands and five family members. Here, we describe another prenatal and five postnatal patients with de novo 8p23.1 duplications analyzed with oligonucleotide array comparative genomic hybridization (oaCGH). Of the common features, mild or moderate developmental delays and/or learning difficulties have been found in 11/12 postnatal probands, a variable degree of mild dysmorphism in 8/12 and congenital heart disease (CHD) in 4/5 prenatal and 3/12 postnatal probands. Behavioral problems, cleft lip and/or palate, macrocephaly, and seizures were confirmed as additional features among the new patients, and novel features included neonatal respiratory distress, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), ocular anomalies, balance problems, hypotonia, and hydrocele. The core duplication of 3.68√¢‚Ç¨‚Ä∞Mb contains 31 genes and microRNAs of which only GATA4, TNKS, SOX7, and XKR6 are likely to be dosage sensitive genes and MIR124-1 and MIR598 have been implicated in neurocognitive phenotypes. A combination of the duplication of GATA4, SOX7, and related genes may account for the variable penetrance of CHD. Two of the duplications were maternal and intrachromosomal in origin with maternal heterozygosity for the common inversion between the repeats in 8p23.1. These additional patients and the absence of the 8p23.1 duplications in published controls, indicate that the 8p23.1 duplication syndrome may now be considered a pathogenic copy number variation (pCNV) with an estimated population prevalence of 1 in 58,000.\n",
      "We report on two severely mentally retarded male children of consanguineous parents who seem to be affected by an identical syndrome. The main physical anomalies are typical facial stigmata with a broad nasal bridge, a bulbous nose, upward slanting palpebral fissures, microretrognathia, low hair line, and large ears with an incompletely developed upper helix. In addition, both brothers had hypospadias type II, limb contractures, and delayed bone age. One child had a bilateral cleft lip with cleft palate and cryptorchidism, and developed scoliosis during adolescence. The other had bilateral inguinal hernias and strabismus. Chromosome analysis showed a normal karyotype in both. The striking similarity between the brothers, the dissimilarity to other known syndromes, and the parental consanguinity argue in favour of a new, hitherto undescribed, possibly autosomal recessive syndrome.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: We report a consanguineous family with 2 affected individuals whose clinical symptoms closely resembled MERRF (myoclonus epilepsy with ragged red fibers) syndrome including severe myoclonic epilepsy, progressive spastic tetraparesis, progressive impairment of vision and hearing, as well as progressive cognitive decline. METHODS: After excluding the presence of pathogenic mitochondrial DNA mutations, whole-exome sequencing of blood DNA from the index patient was performed. Detected homozygous mutations and their cosegregation were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. CARS2 (cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase 2, mitochondrial) messenger RNA analysis was performed by reverse transcription PCR and sequencing. RESULTS: We identified a homozygous c.655G>A mutation in the CARS2 gene cosegregating in the family. The mutation is localized at the last nucleotide of exon 6 and thus is predicted to cause aberrant splicing. Analysis of the CARS2 messenger RNA showed that the presence of the mutation resulted in removal of exon 6. This leads to an in-frame deletion of 28 amino acids in a conserved sequence motif of the protein involved in stabilization of the acceptor end hairpin of tRNA(Cys). CONCLUSION: CARS2 is a novel disease gene associated with a severe progressive myoclonic epilepsy most resembling MERRF syndrome.\n",
      "Two types of splenogonadal fusion (SGF) have been proposed. In the continuous type the spleen is connected to the gonad, and often it is associated with limb defects and other anomalies such as micrognathia, microglossia, anal atresia, and hypoplastic lungs. Associated abnormalities are lower in the discontinuous type of SGF, where there is fusion between the gonad and accessory splenic tissue, without connection with the normal spleen. The cause of SGF and SGF with limb defects (SGFLD) is unknown. On the basis of associated orofacial limb abnormalities, some authors have suggested that SGFLD may be related to the Hanhart complex. Others have noted the overlap between SGFLD and femoral-facial syndrome (FFS). We consider SGFLD a developmental field defect that originates during blastogenesis. Although the cause is unknown, the earlier its action, the more severe the involvement resulting in SGFLD; later action may result only in SGF.\n",
      "Microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism type II (OMIM 210720) is a rare autosomal recessive condition frequently associated with early-onset cerebrovascular disease. Presymptomatic detection and intervention could prevent the adverse consequences associated with this. We reviewed published cases of microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism type II to ascertain prevalence and characteristics of cerebrovascular disease and use these data to propose an evidence-based approach to cerebrovascular screening. Of 147 cases identified, 47 had cerebrovascular disease (32%), including occlusive arteriopathy (including moyamoya) and cerebral aneurysmal disease. Occlusive disease occurred in younger individuals, and progression can be both rapid and clinically silent. A reasonable screening approach would be magnetic resonance imaging and angiography of the cervical and intracranial circulation at diagnosis, repeated at yearly intervals until 10 years, and every 2 years thereafter, unless clinical concerns occur earlier. At present it would appear that this needs to be life-long. Families and professionals should be alerted to the potential significance of neurologic symptoms and measures should be taken to maintain good vascular health in affected individuals.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Hyperbiliverdinaemia is a poorly defined clinical sign that has been infrequently reported in cases of liver cirrhosis or liver carcinoma, usually indicating a poor long-term prognosis. AIMS: To clarify the pathogenesis of hyperbiliverdinaemia in an extended case report. METHODS: A 64-year-old man with alcoholic cirrhosis was admitted to hospital with severe bleeding from oesophageal varices. Ultrasonography showed ascites, but no dilatation of the biliary tree. The skin, sclerae, plasma, urine and ascites of the patient showed a greenish appearance. Bilirubin levels were normal, and there were no signs of haemolysis. Biliverdin was analysed in plasma and urine with liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. The seven exonic regions of the biliverdin reductase-A (BVR-A) gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and sequenced. RESULTS: Biliverdin was present in plasma and urine. In nucleotide 52 of exon I of the DNA isolated from the hyperbiliverdinaemic patient, we discovered a novel heterozygous C-->T nonsense mutation converting an arginine (CGA) in position 18 into a stop codon (TGA) (R18Stop) predicted to truncate the protein N-terminally to the active site Tyr97. Two children of the proband were heterozygous for the identical mutation in the BVR-A gene, but had no clinical signs of liver disease and had normal levels of biliverdin. The BVR-A gene mutation was not found in 200 healthy volunteers or nine patients with end-stage liver cirrhosis. CONCLUSION: Hyperbiliverdinaemia (green jaundice) with green plasma and urine may be caused by a genetic defect in the BVR-A gene in conjunction with decompensated liver cirrhosis.\n",
      "A case presenting a peculiar type of spondylo-epiphyseal dysplasia was studied. Clinically, the normal height was striking. The X-rays showed large epiphysis and wide metaphysis. Bilateral coxa valga with very large femoral necks was present. The height of the vertebral bodies was slightly reduced. The study of the upper tibial growth cartilage showed glycoprotein inclusions in the chondrocytes and large dilatations of the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The gel electrophoresis of the non collagenous proteins extracted from the growth cartilage had an abnormal densitometric tracing. The type of inheritance of this syndrome is unknown, the patient being an isolated case in a normal family.\n",
      "LACHT syndrome, Lung Agenesis, Congenital Heart defects, and Thumb anomalies, (Mardini-Nyhan Association OMIM #601612) is a rare condition characterized by unilateral or bilateral lung agenesis, complex cardiac defects, especially anomalous pulmonary venous return, and thumb anomalies. Based on previous cases, its inheritance pattern seems to be autosomal recessive. In 1985, the syndrome was firstly described by Mardini and Nyhan in four patients from unrelated families. Until now, a total of eight patients have been reported in the literature. Molecular cause of the disease is still unknown. Here, we report on a patient with LACHT syndrome diagnosed by clinical findings. In this study, we present a 4.5-month-old female infant with right lung agenesis and inguinal hernia, in which ovaries are revealed on ultrasonography. The infant was born to consanguineous parents following a 38th week of gestation, with a birth weight of 2,800√¢‚Ç¨‚Ä∞g. Overall development was consistent with age; she had thumb abnormalities. Echocardiography showed peripheral pulmonary stenosis. The girl was diagnosed as LACHT syndrome based on the findings of unilateral lung agenesis, thumb anomalies, and peripheral pulmonary stenosis. LACHT syndrome should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with unilateral or bilateral lung agenesis. Here, we report on the 9th case in the literature. The consanguinity of the parents supports autosomal inheritance as the genetic basis of LACHT syndrome.\n",
      "An eight month old girl was born with symmetrical bilateral oblique facial clefts and calcaneovarus foot deformity. CT scan of the head showed severe bilateral ocular hypoplasia and normal brain parenchyma. Peripheral blood karyotype showed a de novo balanced translocation between a chromosome 1 and 22. A submicroscopic imbalance secondary to this translocation cannot be ruled out. The pattern of the observed anomalies will help distinguish between oblique facial clefts and amniotic band disruption. Chromosomal studies should be performed in children with such rare malformations.\n",
      "The majority of cardiac myxomas occur sporadically as isolated lesions in the left atrium of middle-aged women. However, a \"familial\" form and a \"syndrome\" form of this lesion have been identified. The syndrome myxoma can present with pigmented skin lesions and peripheral or endocrine neoplasms. The familial and syndrome forms of cardiac myxomas can usually be distinguished from the sporadic form by the presentation at a younger age, the unusual location and multicentricity of the lesions, and the presence of rare pathological conditions. In addition, a higher rate of recurrent lesions is usually associated with the familial and syndrome forms of this disease. To date, 15 families with cardiac myxomas have been reported in the world's literature. Here we present 2 additional case reports.\n",
      "The present report describes a 7-year-old girl with a de novo 3 Mb interstitial deletion of chromosome 14q12, identified by oligo array-CGH. The region is gene poor and contains only five genes two of them, FOXG1B and PRKD1 being deleted also in a previously reported case with a very similar phenotype. Both patients present prominent metopic suture, epicanthic folds, bulbous nasal tip, tented upper lip, everted lower lip and large ears and a clinical course like Rett syndrome, including normal perinatal period, postnatal microcephaly, seizures, and severe mental retardation. FOXG1B (forkhead box G1B) is a very intriguing candidate gene since it is known to promote neuronal progenitor proliferation and to suppress premature neurogenesis and its disruption is reported in a patient with postnatal microcephaly, corpus callosum agenesis, seizures, and severe mental retardation.\n",
      "AIM: Glucose transporter 1 deficiency syndrome (GLUT1-DS) is an important condition for the general paediatrician's differential armamentarium. We describe a case series of eight patients in order to raise awareness of this treatable neurometabolic condition. The diagnosis of GLUT1-DS is suggested by a decreased absolute cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glucose value (<2.2 mmol/L) or lowered CSF: plasma glucose ratio (<0.4). METHODS: This is a review of eight Queensland patients with GLUT1-DS. The clinical presentation, clinical course, laboratory investigations and treatment outcomes are discussed. RESULTS: The clinical features noted in our patient cohort include combinations of ataxia, developmental delay and a severe seizure disorder that is refractory to anticonvulsant medications. Seizures are the most common clinical manifestation and may be exacerbated by phenobarbitone. The paired CSF: plasma glucose results ranged from 0.2 to 0.39 (normal <0.6) with an average of 0.33. 3-O-Methyl-D-Glucose uptake and GLUT1 Genotyping analysis have been performed on five patients thus far. Rapid and impressive seizure control was observed in 100% of our patients once the ketogenic diet was instituted, with half of the cohort being able to wean completely from anticonvulsants. CONCLUSION: Children presenting with a clinical phenotype consisting of a refractory seizure disorder, ataxia and developmental delay should prompt the consideration of Glucose transporter 1 deficiency syndrome. While the diagnostic test of lumbar puncture is an invasive manoeuvre, the diagnosis provides a viable treatment option, the ketogenic diet. GLUT1-DS displays clinical heterogeneity, but the value of early diagnosis and treatment is demonstrated by our patient cohort.\n",
      "Hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSPs) encompass a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative disorders. Recently, mutations in fatty acid 2-hydroxylase gene (FA2H) have been identified responsible for HSPs type 35 (SPG35). This study aims to define the contribution of FA2H to Chinese autosomal recessive HSP (AR-HSP) patients and provide insights into the enzymatic functions of the novel mutations. Direct sequencing of FA2H was conducted in 31 AR-HSP families and 55 sporadic cases without SPG11, SPG15, SPG5 and SPG7 gene mutations. Enzymatic activity of the mutated proteins was further examined. Three novel mutations were found in two Chinese families, including two compound heterozygous mutations (c.388C>T/p.L130F and c.506+6C>G) and one homozygous mutation (c.230T>G/p.L77R). The c.506+6C>G splice-site mutation led to the deletion of exon 3. Measurement of enzymatic functions revealed a significant reduction in the enzymatic activity of FA2H associated with p.L130F and p.L77R. Overall, our data widens the spectrum of the mutations on FA2H, and functional analyses indicate that these mutations severely impair the enzymatic activity of FA2H. Furthermore, frequency analysis shows that SPG35 is the second most common subtype of AR-HSP in China.\n",
      "We report on a family in which two of the three children (girl and boy) have a MCA/MR syndrome consisting of peculiar facies, retarded psychomotor development, mental retardation, congenital heart defect, kyphoscoliosis, diastasis recti, and cryptorchidism in the boy. This syndrome is quite similar to that of the only family previously described and which was denominated McDonough Syndrome. The syndrome is delineated and autosomal recessive inheritance is suggested as the most likely etiology. A balanced translocation (X; 20) in the affected boy and in the unaffected mother was a coincidental finding.\n",
      "The Rab GTPase Rab27B and one of its effector proteins, Slac2-b (also known as EXPH5, exophilin-5), have putative roles in intracellular vesicle trafficking but their relevance to human disease is not known. By using whole-exome sequencing, we identified a homozygous frameshift mutation in EXPH5 in three siblings with inherited skin fragility born to consanguineous Iraqi parents. All three individuals harbor the mutation c.5786delC (p.Pro1929Leufs(‚àó)8) in EXPH5, which truncates the 1,989 amino acid Slac2-b protein by 52 residues. The clinical features comprised generalized scale-crusts and occasional blisters, mostly induced by trauma, as well as mild diffuse pigmentary mottling on the trunk and proximal limbs. There was no increased bleeding tendency, no neurologic abnormalities, and no increased incidence of infection. Analysis of an affected person's skin showed loss of Slac2-b immunostaining (C-terminal antibody), disruption of keratinocyte adhesion within the lower epidermis, and an increased number of perinuclear vesicles. A role for Slac2-b in keratinocyte biology was supported by findings of cytoskeletal disruption (mainly keratin intermediate filaments) and decreased keratinocyte adhesion in both keratinocytes from an affected subject and after shRNA knockdown of Slac2-b in normal keratinocytes. Slac2-b was also shown to colocalize with Rab27B and Œ≤4 integrin to early adhesion initiation sites in spreading normal keratinocytes. Collectively, our findings identify an unexpected role for Slac2-b in inherited skin fragility and expand the clinical spectrum of human disorders of GTPase effector proteins.\n",
      "Two brothers referred for hypogonadism presented with short stature, mild mental retardation, and minor anomalies. In addition, both patients had hypogonadism due to primary gonadal failure and mitral valve prolapse, in the absence of other heart defects. A complete hormonal evaluation in one of the patients showed abnormal growth hormone (GH) and gonadotropin responses to different stimuli, findings suggestive of a disorder of hypothalamic-pituitary regulation. Both patients had normal chromosomes (46,XY) as did their mother (46,XX), who had some of the clinical manifestations found in her sons but in a milder form. We propose that this is a new syndrome.\n",
      "The 16p12 region is particularly prone to genomic disorders due to the large number of low copy repeats [Martin et al., 2004; Nature 432:988-994]. We report two unrelated patients with de novo triplication of 16p12.1p12.3 who had developmental delay and similar facial features. Patient 1 is a 4-year-old male with a congenital heart anomaly, bilateral cryptorchidism, chronic constipation, and developmental delay. Patient 2 is a 12-year-old female with prenatally diagnosed hydronephrosis, hepatobiliary disease, failure to thrive, and developmental delay. Distinctive facial features common to both patients include short palpebral fissures, bulbous nose, thin upper vermillion border, apparently lowset ears, and large ear lobes. We compare the clinical manifestations of our patients with a previously reported patient with triplication of 16p12.2.\n",
      "Congenital short bowel syndrome (SBS) is a relatively rare condition as compared to acquired SBS. It is associated with significant mortality and morbidity. Infants usually present with failure to thrive, recurrent vomiting, and diarrhea. It is important to suspect and diagnose this condition promptly, as early initiation of parenteral nutrition or surgery, if necessary, may result in a favorable outcome. We discuss a case of an infant aged 26 days, who presented with failure to thrive, recurrent vomiting, and weight loss. A contrast study of the gastrointestinal tract revealed a short small bowel, with malrotation. The infant was started on parenteral nutrition, but succumbed shortly thereafter to severe disseminated sepsis.\n",
      "X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) is a heterogeneous disorder that can be classified as either non-specific (MRX), when mental retardation is the only feature, or as syndromic mental retardation (MRXS). Genetic defects underlying XLMR are being identified at a rapid pace, often starting from X-chromosomal aberrations and XLMR families with a well-defined linkage interval. Here, we present a new family with a syndromic form of XLMR, including mild mental retardation, short stature, microcephaly and hypogonadism. Two-point linkage analysis with 24 polymorphic markers spanning the entire X chromosome was carried out. We could assign the causative gene to a 6 cM interval in Xp22.1-p21.3, with a maximum LOD score of 2.61 for markers DXS989 and DXS1061 at theta = 0.00. No mutations were found in the presented family for two known MRX genes mapping to this interval, ARX and IL1RAPL-1. These data indicate that the interval Xp22.1-p21.3 contains at least one additional MRXS gene.\n",
      "Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) are a group of mostly autosomal recessive disorders primarily characterized by neurological abnormalities. Recently, we described a single CDG patient with a de novo mutation in the X-linked gene, Signal Sequence Receptor 4 (SSR4). We performed whole-exome sequencing to identify causal variants in several affected individuals who had either an undifferentiated neurological disorder or unsolved CDG of unknown etiology based on abnormal transferrin glycosylation. We now report eight affected males with either de novo (4) or inherited (4) loss of function mutations in SSR4. Western blot analysis revealed that the mutations caused a complete loss of SSR4 protein. In nearly all cases, the abnormal glycosylation of serum transferrin was only slightly above the accepted normal cutoff range.\n",

      "A family is presented in which ano-rectal malformation and features common to Alport Syndrome appear to be present in three generations. The possibility of a new syndrome based on a single gene defect is discussed.\n",
      "INTRODUCTION:Cushing's syndrome has a very low incidence (1-10 cases/million/year), and familial cases are even more rare. We report on two situations involving different causes of Cushing's syndrome. CASES:In the first case, we describe the case of a patient with an adrenal adenoma 20 years before the occurrence of Cushing's disease related to the pineal gland. In the second case, two members of the same family were diagnosed almost simultaneously with adrenal cortical adenoma (mother) and Cushing's disease (daughter). DISCUSSION:These cases lead us to consider the known causes of familial Cushing's syndrome, which were not found here.\n",
      "A large inbred Lebanese pedigree with congenital spastic ataxia, microcephaly, optic atrophy, short stature, speech defect, abnormal osmiophilic pattern of skin vessels, cerebellar atrophy, and severe mental retardation transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait has been studied. None of the children had any evidence of a metabolic disease, and the analysis of respiratory chain complex abnormalities was unremarkable. Only one child had a history of perinatal difficulties. Differential diagnosis and the possibility that this disorder is a hitherto unreported one are discussed.\n",
      "We describe a 16-year-old girl and her 41-year-old father who both had a bleeding tendency, dramatic prolongation of all standard clotting assays, undetectable levels of plasma protein C activity, and low or borderline levels of factors X, XI and XII. Plasma and serum electrophoresis revealed a minor peak following the main alpha(1) globulin peak, of which the proportion was increased. Platelet aggregation by thrombin (final concentration 1 U/mL) was absent in both patients, but this inhibition can be overcome by increasing the concentration of thrombin (4 U/mL). The molecular defect responsible for these coagulation abnormalities was identified by genomic sequencing. Both patients are heterozygous for alpha(1)-antitrypsin Met 358 to Arg (alpha(1)-antitrypsin Pittsburgh). Seven other members of this pedigree had normal coagulation tests and do not carry the same genetic mutation. This unique family with alpha1-antitrypsin Pittsburgh sheds some light on the study of this extremely rare mutation and its inheritance.\n",
      "Chilblain lupus erythematosus (CHLE) is a rare, chronic form of cutaneous lupus erythematosus. Sporadic cases and two families with autosomal dominant-inherited CHLE have been reported. In familial CHLE, two missense mutations in TREX1 encoding the 3'-5' repair exonuclease 1 were described in affected individuals. The pathogenesis of sporadic CHLE remains unknown. Up to 20% of patients develop systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). An association with anorexia is discussed. In many cases, there is good response to symptomatic therapy. SLE therapeutics have good effects on SLE-typical symptoms but not on chilblains themselves. This article reviews the clinical presentation, pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of CHLE. As an index patient with unique features, we report a 13-year-old boy developing CHLE after anorexia nervosa. Sequencing of TREX1 was normal. With psychotherapeutic support for anorexia and after antibiotic therapy, topical steroids, physical warming and calcium channel blockers, the patient experienced significant relief. Improvement of phalangeal perfusion was demonstrated by angio-MRI.\n",
      "In 1977 Harrod et al. [BD:OAS XIII (3B): 111-115] reported 2 brothers with an unusual syndrome of mental retardation, unusual facial appearance, large protruding ears, arachnodactyly, hypogenitalism, failure to thrive, and minor anomalies. We report on a 46-year-old man with striking resemblance to the children described by Harrod who also has secondary megacolon and varicose veins, suggesting a connective tissue disorder.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Russell Silver syndrome (RSS) leads to prenatal and postnatal growth retardation. About 55% of RSS patients present a loss-of-methylation of the paternal ICR1 domain on chromosome 11p15. CDKN1C is a cell proliferation inhibitor encoded by an imprinted gene in the 11p15 ICR2 domain. CDKN1C mutations lead to Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome (BWS, overgrowth syndrome) and in IMAGe syndrome which associates growth retardation and adrenal insufficiency. We searched for CDKN1C mutations in a cohort of clinically diagnosed RSS patients with no molecular anomaly. METHOD: The coding sequence and intron-exon boundaries of CDKN1C were analysed in 97 RSS patients. The impact of CDKN1C variants on the cell cycle in vitro were determined by flow cytometry. Stability of CDKN1C was studied by western immunoblotting after inhibition of translation with cycloheximide. RESULTS: We identified the novel c.836G>[G;T] (p.Arg279Leu) mutation in a familial case of intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) with RSS phenotype and no evidence of IMAGe. All the RSS patients inherited this mutation from their mothers (consistent with monoallelic expression from the maternal allele of the gene). A mutation of this amino acid (p.Arg279Pro) has been reported in cases of IMAGe. Functional analysis showed that Arg279Leu (RSS) did not affect the cell cycle, whereas the Arg279Pro mutation (IMAGe) led to a gain of function. Arg279Leu (RSS) led to an increased stability which could explain an increased activity of CDKN1C. CONCLUSIONS: CDKN1C mutations cause dominant maternally transmitted RSS, completing the molecular mirror with BWS. CDKN1C should be investigated in cases with family history of RSS.\n",
      "Myb-like, SWIRM, and MPN domains 1 (MYSM1) is a transcriptional regulator mediating histone deubiquitination. Its role in human immunity and hematopoiesis is poorly understood.We sought to investigate the clinical, cellular, and molecular features in 2 siblings presenting with progressive bone marrow failure (BMF), immunodeficiency, and developmental aberrations.We performed genome-wide homozygosity mapping, whole-exome and Sanger sequencing, immunophenotyping studies, and analysis of genotoxic stress responses. p38 activation, reactive oxygen species levels, rate of apoptosis and clonogenic survival, and growth in immune and nonimmune cells were assessed. The outcome of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) was monitored.We report 2 patients with progressive BMF associated with myelodysplastic features, immunodeficiency affecting B cells and neutrophil granulocytes, and complex developmental aberrations, including mild skeletal anomalies, neurocognitive developmental delay, and cataracts. Whole-exome sequencing revealed a homozygous premature stop codon mutation in the gene encoding MYSM1. MYSM1-deficient cells are characterized by increased sensitivity to genotoxic stress associated with sustained induction of phosphorylated p38 protein, increased reactive oxygen species production, and decreased survival following UV light-induced DNA damage. Both patients were successfully treated with allogeneic HSCT with sustained reconstitution of hematopoietic defects.Here we show that MYSM1 deficiency is associated with developmental aberrations, progressive BMF with myelodysplastic features, and increased susceptibility to genotoxic stress. HSCT represents a curative therapy for patients with MYSM1 deficiency.\n",
      "Arts syndrome is characterized by early-onset hypotonia, ataxia, intellectual disability, sensorineural hearing impairment, progressive optic atrophy, and a tendency to develop infections. Arts syndrome is an X-linked disorder caused by a loss-of-function mutation in the PRPS1 gene, which encodes phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase 1. Only three families have been reported. Here, we report another family with Arts syndrome. The initial symptoms of the 1-year-old proband were hypotonia and ataxia, worsening recurrent infection-triggered muscle weakness, motor and intellectual developmental delay, and hearing loss. Both central nervous system involvement and peripheral neuropathy were demonstrated. His three maternal uncles had died before the age of 3years. A genetic analysis of PRPS1 revealed a novel missense mutation, c.367C>G (p.His123Asp). PRPS enzymatic activity was markedly reduced in the patient. His mother was supposed to be an asymptomatic carrier. Arts syndrome should be included in the differential diagnosis of infantile hypotonia and weakness aggravated by recurrent infection with a family history of X-linked inheritance.\n",
      "The youngest affected member of a family with a five-generation history of posterior amorphous corneal dystrophy underwent penetrating keratoplasty. The corneal button was studied by light and electron microscopy, representing the first pathologic description of this condition. Light microscopy demonstrated fracturing of the most posterior collagen layers of the stroma and focal attenuation of endothelial cells. Electron microscopy showed the collagen fibers in the most posterior stromal lamellae to be disorganized. Descemet's layer was interrupted by a band of collagen fibers resembling stroma, and there was loss of endothelial cells. These findings suggest a developmental abnormality in the formation of the posterior stroma and Descemet's membrane in posterior amorphous corneal dystrophy.\n",
      "Dienoyl-CoA reductase (DECR) deficiency with hyperlysinemia is a rare disorder affecting the metabolism of polyunsaturated fatty acids and lysine. The molecular basis of this condition is currently unknown. We describe a new case with failure to thrive, developmental delay, lactic acidosis and severe encephalopathy suggestive of a mitochondrial disorder. Exome sequencing revealed a causal mutation in NADK2. NADK2 encodes the mitochondrial NAD kinase, which is crucial for NADP biosynthesis evidenced by decreased mitochondrial NADP(H) levels in patient fibroblasts. DECR and also the first step in lysine degradation are performed by NADP-dependent oxidoreductases explaining their in vivo deficiency. DECR activity was also deficient in lysates of patient fibroblasts and could only be rescued by transfecting patient cells with functional NADK2. Thus NADPH is not only crucial as a cosubstrate, but can also act as a molecular chaperone that activates and stabilizes enzymes. In addition to polyunsaturated fatty acid oxidation and lysine degradation, NADPH also plays a role in various other mitochondrial processes. We found decreased oxygen consumption and increased extracellular acidification in patient fibroblasts, which may explain why the disease course is consistent with clinical criteria for a mitochondrial disorder. We conclude that DECR deficiency with hyperlysinemia is caused by mitochondrial NADP(H) deficiency due to a mutation in NADK2.\n",
      "Congenital myopathies are clinically and genetically heterogeneous diseases that typically present in childhood with hypotonia and weakness and are most commonly defined by changes observed in muscle biopsy. Approximately 40% of congenital myopathies are currently genetically unresolved. We identified a family with dominantly inherited congenital myopathy characterized by distal weakness and biopsy changes that included core-like areas and increased internalized nuclei. To identify the causative genetic abnormality in this family, we performed linkage analysis followed by whole-exome capture and next-generation sequencing. A splice-acceptor variant in previously uncharacterized CCDC78 was detected in affected individuals and absent in unaffected family members and > 10,000 controls. This variant alters RNA-transcript processing and results in a 222√Ç¬†bp in-frame insertion. CCDC78 is expressed in skeletal muscle, enriched in the perinuclear region and the triad, and found in intracellular aggregates in patient muscle. Modeling of the CCDC78 mutation in zebrafish resulted in changes mirroring the human disease that included altered motor function and abnormal muscle ultrastructure. Using a combination of linkage analysis, next-generation sequencing, and modeling in the zebrafish, we have identified a CCDC78 mutation associated with a unique myopathy with prominent internal nuclei and atypical cores.\n",
      "We report two patients with a new phenotype of dysferlinopathy presenting as congenital muscular disease. Both patients showed weakness in proximal lower limbs and neck flexor muscles at birth. The presence of normal CK levels during the first years should be noted. Initial MRI showed no abnormalities but short-time-inversion-recovery (STIR) sequences revealed a striking myoedema in gastrocnemius and hamstring muscles at the age of 5. Muscle biopsy showed mild dystrophic features and the absence of dysferlin. Dysferlin gene (DYSF) analysis revealed a p.Ala927LeufsX21 mutation in a homozygous state in both siblings. This new phenotype widens the clinical spectrum of dysferlin myopathies.\n",
      "We report a case of pediatric acute megakaryocytic leukemia (AMKL) showing 48,XX,+21,+21 as a sole acquired cytogenetic abnormality without the mutation of GATA1 gene. A physical examination showed a phenotypically normal female. Bone marrow findings showed diffuse infiltration of leukemic blasts having scanty cytoplasm with budding blebs and prominent nucleoli, which were negative for myeloperoxide (MPO) stain, Sudan black B stain and periodic acid-Schiff stain. Immunophenotyping of leukemic cells revealed positive expression of CD34, CD13, CD33, CD117, CD41, CD61, CD7 and negative expression of TdT, anti-MPO, CD64, CD56, CD2, CD3, CD5, CD10, CD19, CD20 and CD22. A fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis showed four distinct AML1 signals in 284 of 300 interphase nuclei. The entire six exons of the GATA1 gene (7757bp) were directly sequenced. We could not find any mutations, including known polymorphisms, which are known to be involved in transient myeloproliferative disorder and acute megakaryocytic leukemia of Down syndrome. After achieving complete remission, the tetrasomy 21 disappeared.\n",
      "Respiratory chain deficiencies exhibit a wide variety of clinical phenotypes resulting from defective mitochondrial energy production through oxidative phosphorylation. These defects can be caused by either mutations in the mtDNA or mutations in nuclear genes coding for mitochondrial proteins. The underlying pathomechanisms can affect numerous pathways involved in mitochondrial physiology. By whole-exome and candidate gene sequencing, we identified 11 individuals from 9 families carrying compound heterozygous or homozygous mutations in GTPBP3, encoding the mitochondrial GTP-binding protein 3. Affected individuals from eight out of nine families presented with combined respiratory chain complex deficiencies in skeletal muscle. Mutations in GTPBP3 are associated with a severe mitochondrial translation defect, consistent with the predicted function of the protein in catalyzing the formation of 5-taurinomethyluridine (œÑm(5)U) in the anticodon wobble position of five mitochondrial tRNAs. All case subjects presented with lactic acidosis and nine developed hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In contrast to individuals with mutations in MTO1, the protein product of which is predicted to participate in the generation of the same modification, most individuals with GTPBP3 mutations developed neurological symptoms and MRI involvement of thalamus, putamen, and brainstem resembling Leigh syndrome. Our study of a mitochondrial translation disorder points toward the importance of posttranscriptional modification of mitochondrial tRNAs for proper mitochondrial function.\n",
      "The clinical features of four patients with retinitis pigmentosa, ataxia and peripheral neuropathy but with no increase in serum phytanic acid are reported. Three patients also had sensorineural deafness and radiological evidence of cerebellar atrophy. Nerve conduction studies revealed abnormalities of sensory conduction and normal or only mild slowing of motor conduction velocity. Sural nerve biopsy demonstrated a reduction in the density of myelinated fibres. There were no onion bulb formations. These cases clinically resemble Refsum's disease, but differ in having no detectable biochemical abnormality, and a peripheral neuropathy which is not hypertrophic in type. They may represent unusual cases of spinocerebellar degeneration.\n",
      "An association of Hirschsprung disease with polydactyly, unilateral renal agenesis, hypertelorism, and congenital deafness is described in sibs (brother and sister) of consanguineous parents. It is suggested that this might represent a new autosomal recessive syndrome.\n",
      "A new syndrome characterized by cleft palate, coloboma, hypospadias, deafness, short stature, and radial synostosis has been described. The family history suggests either an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance with limited expression in females or X-linkage. Other syndromes with similar phenotypes and modes of inheritance are discussed. The need for accurate and complete family histories in cases involving cleft palate and cleft lip/palate is discussed in relation to genetic counselling and recurrent risk estimates.\n",
      "Small chromosomal duplications involving 7q36.3 have rarely been reported. This clinical report describes four individuals from a three-generation family with agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC) and a 0.73√¢‚Ç¨‚Ä∞Mb duplication of 7q36.3 detected by array CGH. The 7q36.3 duplication involves two genes: RNA Binding Motif Protein 33 (RBM33) and Sonic Hedgehog (SHH). Most affected family members had mild intellectual disability or borderline intellectual functioning, macrocephaly, a broad forehead, and widely spaced eyes. Two individuals had a Chiari type I malformation. This is the first family reported with ACC associated with a small duplication of these genes. While we cannot establish causation for the relationship between any single gene and the ACC in this family, there is a role for SHH in the formation of the corpus callosum through correct patterning and assembly of the commissural plate, and these data concur with vertebrate studies showing that a gain of SHH expands the facial primordium.\n",
      "The mitochondrial translation system is responsible for the synthesis of 13 proteins required for oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), the major energy-generating process of our cells. Mitochondrial translation is controlled by various nuclear encoded proteins. In 27 patients with combined OXPHOS deficiencies, in whom complex II (the only complex that is entirely encoded by the nuclear DNA) showed normal activities, and mutations in the mitochondrial genome as well as polymerase gamma were excluded, we screened all mitochondrial translation factors for mutations. Here, we report a mutation in mitochondrial elongation factor G1 (GFM1) in a patient affected by severe, rapidly progressive mitochondrial encephalopathy. This mutation is predicted to result in an Arg250Trp substitution in subdomain G' of the elongation factor G1 protein and is presumed to hamper ribosome-dependent GTP hydrolysis. Strikingly, the decrease in enzyme activities of complex I, III and IV detected in patient fibroblasts was not found in muscle tissue. The OXPHOS system defects and the impairment in mitochondrial translation in fibroblasts were rescued by overexpressing wild-type GFM1, establishing the GFM1 defect as the cause of the fatal mitochondrial disease. Furthermore, this study evinces the importance of a thorough diagnostic biochemical analysis of both muscle tissue and fibroblasts in patients suspected to suffer from a mitochondrial disorder, as enzyme deficiencies can be selectively expressed.\n",
      "Mucociliary dysfunction can be caused by the absence of cilia or by abnormalities in their ultrastructure. A family in which some members were suffering from respiratory morbidity due to lack of cilia is described.\n",
      "Progressive encephalopathy with edema, hypsarrhythmia, and optic nerve atrophy (PEHO) syndrome is a rare, apparently autosomal recessive condition in which characteristic dysmorphic features are associated with subcutaneous edema, visual deficit, early arrest of psychomotor development, seizures, and cerebellar atrophy. A condition similar to PEHO syndrome, but without the neuroradiologic or ophthalmologic signs, is known as PEHO-like syndrome. We present the case of a child with PEHO-like syndrome and underline the need for a careful follow-up of these patients to identify signs and symptoms that can have a later onset, such as optic atrophy.\n",
      "Progressive calcification of the brain and the spinal cord at early infantile onset was observed in two siblings. They showed growth failure, psychomotor deterioration, deafness, vestibular dysfunction, microcytic hypochromic anemia, abnormal ratios of lymphocyte subpopulations, and slightly decreased bicarbonate on blood gas analysis. Distal renal tubular acidosis was demonstrated in one of them. Carbonic anhydrase II activity was normal. This new hereditary disease might have a defect in a molecule that is present in brain, spinal cord, kidney and hematocytes and is involved in H+/HCO3- production or transport.\n",
      "We present three siblings with a precise onset of fetal seizure-like activity who had severe olivopontocerebellar hypoplasia (OPCH) and degeneration. Autopsies at 20, 27, and 37 weeks gestation showed diffuse central nervous system volume loss that was most marked for the cerebellum and brain stem structures. Neuropathological abnormalities included dysplastic, C-shaped inferior olivary nuclei, absent or immature dentate nuclei, and cell paucity more marked for the cerebellar vermis than the hemispheres. Delayed development was seen in layer 2 of the cerebral cortex and in Purkinje cells of the cerebellum. Prenatal monitoring defined a developmental window of 16-18 weeks gestation when ultrasonic assessment of cerebellar width was used for prenatal diagnosis. We discuss our findings in the context of the differential diagnosis for infantile (O)PCH and propose a classification scheme for the pontocerebellar hypoplasias. These patients represent the earliest reported with OPCH and provide unique information regarding the developmental neuropathology of this condition.\n",
      "A bizarre syndrome has hitherto masqueraded as leprechaunism, and although it is a quite different disorder it has been used as the prototype of leprechaunism in some birth defects atlases. It is proposed that this condition is designated the Patterson syndrome and details of a second case are reported. The features of this connective tissue and neuroendocrine disorder include bronzed hyperpigmentation, cutis laxa of the hands and feet, bodily disproportion, severe mental retardation, and major bony deformities. Radiographs revealed a unique and gross generalised skeletal dysplasia, unlikely to be confused with any other disorder. This endocrine abnormality comprised hyperadrenocorticism, cushingoid features, and diabetes mellitus in the first case, and premature adrenarche in the second case. The pathogenesis and aetiology of the Patterson syndrome are unknown, although quantitative and qualitative abnormalities of mucopolysaccharide excretion were found in the second case.\n",
      "A girl patient born to healthy nonconsanguineous parents was referred at age 3 years and 2 months to our genetics department for testing due to developmental delay and postnatal microcephaly. Initial clinical evaluation revealed an overall developmental delay, mildly dysmorphic features, thin, sparse fair hair, and fair skin. Postnatal microcephaly and progressive ataxia and spasticity appeared later. Array CGH karyotyping showed a 333 kb de novo microdeletion on 3p22 covering the entire genomic sequence of a single gene, CTNNB1, which codes for Œ≤-catenin. Œ≤-catenin is a sub-unit of a multiprotein complex, which is part of the Wnt signaling pathway. In mice, a conditional homozygous Œ≤-catenin knockout displays loss of neurons, impaired craniofacial development, and hair follicle defects, which is similar to the phenotype presented by the patient described in this clinical report. Thus, CTNNB1 haploinsufficiency causes neuronal loss, craniofacial anomalies and hair follicle defects in both humans and mice. Point mutations in CTNNB1 in human have recently been reported but this is the first observation of a new recognizable multiple congenital anomaly/mental retardation syndrome caused by CTNNB1 haploinsufficiency. This clinical report should prompt a search for point mutations in CTNNB1 in patients presenting developmental delay, mild hair, skin and facial anomalies, and neurodegeneration characterized by postnatal microcephaly, and progressive ataxia and spasticity. ¬© 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\n",
      "Biemond syndrome type 2 (BS2) is classically regarded as a recessively inherited condition (MIM 210350) comprising mental retardation, coloboma, obesity, polydactyly, hypogonadism, hydrocephalus, and facial dysostosis. Clinically, the disorder is closely related to Bardet-Biedl syndrome. Few cases have been reported, most of them before 1970. We present clinical data on three mentally retarded sporadic cases with coloboma, obesity, and hypogenitalism (in two of them), fitting as first glance a diagnosis of BS2. A review documents striking clinical variability among the patients said to have BS2. We propose a new nosology of those cases and delineate several new clinical forms. Purported BS2 cases may be divided into: (1) Bardet-Biedl syndrome with fortuitous coloboma or aniridia, (2) BS2 sensu stricto, a recessively inherited syndrome of sexual infantilism, short stature, coloboma, and preaxial polydactyly without obesity, only known from the original report, (3) a \"new\" dominantly inherited form of colobomatous microphthalmia occasionally associated with obesity, hypogonadism, and mental retardation, to which our observations belong. (4) cytogenetically proven Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (one case), (5) an unclassifiable, early lethal familial syndrome resembling Buntinx-Majewski syndrome, and (6) a \"new\" coloboma-zygodactyly-clefting syndrome. The latter two syndromes may result from chromosomal anomaly.\n",
      "Cerebellar hypoplasia with endosteal sclerosis is an infrequent entity that has been described in only four cases. Major clinical symptoms are cerebellar hypoplasia causing ataxia, hypotonia, mild to moderate developmental delay, microcephaly, growth retardation, endosteal sclerosis, tooth eruption disturbances, and hip dislocations. We report on a girl with this entity, whom we followed for 11 years. The endosteal sclerosis remained stationary over time, as were the clinical neurological symptoms, but neuroadiological symptoms were slowly progressive. We provide a short review of this probably autosomal recessively inherited disorder. (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.\n",
      "This baby boy was born after a pregnancy complicated by severe polyhydramnios at a gestational age of 28 weeks. Analysis of the amniotic fluid had shown a high chloride content, but normal concentrations of sodium, potassium, and calcium. After birth he displayed extreme polyuria, severe renal sodium and chloride loss, and marked hypercalciuria. Five weeks after birth, his sodium chloride loss turned into renal potassium loss, along with a marked decrease in urine output. All these features are characteristic of the neonatal variant of Bartter syndrome. He was discharged after 11 weeks with oral supplements of sodium chloride, potassium gluconate, and 500 ml of fluid. The follow-up for a period of 6 years showed a surprising evolution: he has no hypokalemic alkalosis, no polyuria, and no hypercalciuria; growth and development are within the normal ranges and, at the time of writing, he is a healthy boy needing no medication and with no medical problems whatsoever.\n",
      "A new syndrome of cataracts and progressive sensorineural hearing loss, inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, is described. The histopathology of the inner ears in the proband demonstrated severe degeneration limited to the cochlea and saccule. This case represents the second reported example of genetically determined cochleosaccular degeneration in man. The cochleosaccular pattern of histopathology is found in both man and animals and may be the end result of prenatal dysplasia or postnatal degeneration. It also appears that cochleosaccular dysplasia and degeneration may be the result of genetically determined or acquired defects. Previously reported examples of cochleosaccular dysplasia and degeneration are reviewed including human cases in which the histopathology is similar to, but not characteristic of, the cochleosaccular pattern.\n",
      "We describe an X-linked disorder of the CNS, characterized by onset, in infancy, of hypotonia, ataxia, sensorineural deafness, developmental delay, esotropias, and optic atrophy, and by a progressive course leading to death in childhood. Pathologically, neuron loss and gliosis of the dentate nucleus and inferior olive are conspicuous; involvement of the cerebellar cortex is less prominent. In the proband, the red nucleus, dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, and central auditory pathways were severely affected. The mother of the proband, now 33, has self-limited episodes of ataxia, and cerebellar atrophy for which no other cause is apparent. The unique heredity, pathology, and clinical picture distinguish this entity from previously described inherited or metabolic ataxias.\n",
      "Spondylometaphyseal dysplasia Algerian type (SMD-A) is an autosomal dominant disorder that was first reported in an Algerian family by Kozlowski et al. [Pediatr Radiol 1988;18:221-226]. Kozlowski's group reported a sporadic case in a 12-year-old Polish boy. They proposed SMD-A as a distinctive skeletal dysplasia and also suggested that a case of SMD reported by Schmidt et al. [J Pediatr 1963;63:106-112] might have had the same disorder. Afterwards, however, no additional report has emerged to date. In addition, the question whether SMD-A belongs to type II collagenopathy (a group of disorders due to a heterozygous mutation of COL2A1) has been continuously under debate. Here we report a 7-year-old Japanese boy with a heterozygous missense mutation in COL2A1, 2582G>T (Gly861Val), whose phenotype matched that of SMD-A. Our observation supports the hypothesis that SMD-A is a variant of type II collagenopathy.\n",
      "The ichthyosis follicular with atrichia and photophobia syndrome (IFAP) is a rare X-linked multiple congenital malformation syndrome. Some male patients have additional features including brain anomalies, intellectual disability, ectodermal dysplasia, skeletal deformities, ear or eye anomalies and kidney dysplasia/hypoplasia (BRESEK syndrome) sometimes associated with Hirschsprung disease and cleft palate or cryptorchidism (BRESHECK syndrome). We report a 5 months-old male patient with the p.R429H mutation in MBTPS2 protein, which has been reported to be associated with the most severe phenotype of patients with IFAP/BRESHECK syndrome. This patient presented with a severe IFAP/BRESHECK phenotype including ichthyosis follicular, atrichia, photophobia, brain anomalies, global developmental delay, Hirschsprung disease and kidney hypoplasia. Additional features not previously reported in IFAP syndrome, include severe hypogammaglobulinemia and congenital rectourethral fistula.\n",
      "Progeria syndromes are rare disorders that involve premature aging. Mutations in BANF1 have been recently reported to cause a new hereditary progeroid syndrome that we now propose to call the N√©stor-Guillermo progeria syndrome (NGPS). We describe herein the clinical features of the first two NGPS patients, who phenocopy features of classic progerias (i.e., Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome or mandibuloacral dysplasia), such as aged appearance, growth retardation, decreased subcutaneous fat, thin limbs, and stiff joints. However, these NGPS patients have a distinctive phenotype. In their early adulthood (32 and 24 years of age), they have no signs of cardiovascular impairment, diabetes mellitus, or hypertriglyceridemia. In contrast, they suffer profound skeletal abnormalities that affect their quality of life. The observed differences are of utmost importance to patients and their families and palliation of osseous manifestations is a priority, given their relatively long lifespan. We define NGPS as a chronic progeria because of its slow clinical course and relatively long survival, despite its early onset. Understanding the differences between progeria syndromes might contribute to the development of treatment strategies for common skeletal conditions, as well as aging itself.\n",
      "We report the case of a 58-year-old woman who was referred to our hospital due to frequent bloody mucus diarrhea. She was diagnosed with cap polyposis based on typical endoscopic and histological findings. Colonoscopy revealed multiple, reddish, mucus-capped polypoid lesions from the rectum to the sigmoid colon. A pathological examination revealed that the polyps were covered by erosive and inflamed granulation tissue with decreased crypt cells. Laboratory data indicated positive values for Helicobacter pylori immunoglobulin G antibody and hypoproteinemia. Metronidazole, H. pylori eradication, and levofloxacin therapies were not effective; however, the subsequent administration of betamethasone enema dramatically improved the clinical symptoms and endoscopic findings. The hypoproteinemia was normalized after the therapy. The dose of the betamethasone enema was tapered gradually, and no recurrence was observed 6 months after discontinuation of the treatment. This case suggests that betamethasone enema may be considered as the second treatment choice for cap polyposis patients after H. pylori eradication, metronidazole or levofloxacin therapy.\n",
      "The case is reported of an infant with autoimmune haemolytic anaemia of perinatal onset. Combined treatment with steroids and cyclosporin was necessary to improve haemolysis and reduce the high transfusion requirements. Treatment was discontinued at 13 months of age. The child was healthy at the follow up at 24 and 36 months of age.\n",
      "We report on an apparently new syndrome in a consanguineous family with seven members, three of whom have cerebral anomalies including pachygyria and arachnoid cysts along with mental retardation and seizures. The two patients with seizure disorders also had multiple enlarged perivascular spaces seen in the white matter of the centrum semiovale. Our data provide a contribution to the accumulating knowledge on familial cerebral anomalies including arachnoid cysts and lissencephaly. Given the lack of mutation in known lissencephaly genes such as LIS1, 14-3-3epsilon, and DCX, this syndrome may constitute a new phenotype with autosomal recessive inheritance.\n",
      "X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) is a heterogeneous disorder with both syndromic and non-syndromic forms. Here we describe the clinical and molecular characterisation of a family with a syndromic form of XLMR with hypogonadism and short stature. We investigated a family in which four male members in two generations presented with hypergonadotrophic hypogonadism associated with development of small and abnormal testes. In two of the males, late-onset testicular ascent was noted. In addition, all affected males had short stature (<0.4th centile) and mild learning difficulties and three out of the four had microcephaly. Karyotypes were normal and endocrine investigations confirmed primary testicular failure. The phenotype segregated as an X-linked trait. Haplotype and genetic two-point linkage analysis with 22 microsatellites excluded the whole X chromosome except for a region on Xq25-Xq27 encompassing 13.7Mb with a maximum LOD score of 1.1 for marker DXS8038 at theta=0.05. One family previously described as having XLMR with hypogonadism and short stature maps to the same X chromosome region implicated in our family. However, the more severe mental retardation, muscle wasting and tremor described in this other family would suggest that our family is affected by a novel XLMR syndrome.\n",
      "Recently, a newly identified autosomal recessive skeletal dysplasia was described characterized by calvarial abnormalities (including cranium bifidum, coronal, and lambdoid synostosis), oligodactyly, femoral bowing, narrow thorax, small pelvic bones, and radiohumeral synostosis. In the two families described, a more severe phenotype led to in utero lethality in three siblings while in a single patient in a second family the phenotype was sufficiently mild to allow survival to 5 months of age. The disorder is caused by biallelic missense mutations in CYP26B1, which encodes for a cytochrome P450 enzyme responsible for the catabolism of retinoic acid in a temporally and spatially restricted fashion during embryonic development. Here, we provide the third family affected by the disorder and the first affected individual to survive beyond infancy. This woman homozygous for c.1303G>A; p.(Gly435Ser) in CYP26B1, which was associated with multisutural synostosis, radiohumeral synostosis, normal bone mineral density, and apparent intellectual disability, a phenotype with significant similarities to Antley-Bixler and Pfeiffer syndromes. √Ç¬© 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\n",
      "We report on a brother and a sister with congenital nystagmus, cone-rod dysfunction, high myopia, and aplasia cutis congenita on the midline of the scalp vertex. To our knowledge this familial oculocutaneous condition, transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait, has not been reported previously.\n",
      "DMT1 mediates the pH-dependent uptake of Fe(2+) from the diet in duodenal enterocytes and in most other cells. It transfers iron from the endosomes to the cytosol following the uptake of the transferrin-transferrin receptor complex. DMT1 mutations are responsible for severe hypochromic microcytic anemia in rodents and in 2 human patients described recently. We report a compound heterozygote for 2 new DMT1 mutations, associated with microcytic anemia from birth and progressive liver iron overload. The first mutation is a GTG deletion in exon 5, leading to the V114 in-frame deletion in transmembrane domain 2, and the second is a G --> T substitution in exon 8 leading to the G212V replacement in transmembrane domain 5. Together with the 2 previously reported cases, this patient defines a new syndrome of congenital microcytic hypochromic anemia, poorly responsive to oral iron treatment, with liver iron overload associated paradoxically with normal to moderately elevated serum ferritin levels.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE:To provide clinical, MRI, and histopathologic findings in a rare white matter disorder with autosomal dominant inheritance, so-called hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with spheroids (HDLS). BACKGROUND:Progressive leukoencephalopathies often constitute a diagnostic dilemma in both children and adults. In some cases, histopathologic examination of brain tissue is required for a classifying diagnosis. METHODS:Clinical history, MRI, and autopsy findings were reviewed in three patients with HDLS: a father, his daughter, and an unrelated patient. RESULTS:Clinical history consisted of an adult-onset neurologic deterioration with signs of frontal lobe dysfunction, epilepsy, spasticity, ataxia, and mild extrapyramidal disturbances. MRI findings included cerebral atrophy and patchy white matter changes, most pronounced in the frontal and frontoparietal area with extension through the posterior limb of the internal capsule into the pyramidal tracts of the brainstem. Autopsy in two patients revealed a leukoencephalopathy with frontoparietal and frontal preponderance and numerous neuroaxonal spheroids in the abnormal white matter. The pyramidal tracts were affected throughout the brainstem. CONCLUSION:Similar clinical and histopathologic findings have been reported in members of a Swedish pedigree. The homogeneity of the findings strongly suggests that HDLS is a distinct disease entity. In the absence of a biochemical or genetic marker, a definitive diagnosis requires histopathologic confirmation in one of the affected family members. Neuroaxonal spheroids.\n",
      "We report a neonate with ubiquinone deficiency. Skeletal muscle analysis revealed markedly diminished mitochondrial complex II + III activity that could be restored by addition of a ubiquinone analogue. Ubiquinone deficiency was confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Oral ubiquinone therapy was not associated with clinical improvement; the patient died at 2 years.\n",
      "We performed genetic and immunohistochemical studies in a sister and brother with autosomal recessive neonatal inflammatory skin and bowel lesions. The girl died suddenly at 12 years of age from parvovirus B19-associated myocarditis; her brother had mild cardiomyopathy. We identified a loss-of-function mutation in ADAM17, which encodes a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17 (also called tumor necrosis factor Œ± [TNF-Œ±]-converting enzyme, or TACE), as the probable cause of this syndrome. Peripheral-blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from the brother at 17 years of age showed high levels of lipopolysaccharide-induced production of interleukin-1Œ≤ and interleukin-6 but impaired release of TNF-Œ±. Despite repeated skin infections, this young man has led a relatively normal life. (Funded by Barts and the London Charity and the European Commission Seventh Framework Programme.).\n",
      "Radial ray anomalies can occur as isolated defects [Temtamy and McKusick, 1978] or as components of genetic syndromes, which are delineated on the basis of the associated anomalies, inheritance, chromosome, or hematological abnormalities. Syndrome identification is important because of the prognostic implications of the particular hematologic, oncologic, and clinical complications specific for each condition. In some instances overlap and variable expression of the manifestations associated with the radial ray defect confuse nosological definition and genetic counselling. In this paper we describe a father and his 2 daughters, who manifested variable defects of the radial ray and concurrent choanal malformations and esotropia. This apparently autosomal dominant condition differs from other radial ray hypoplasia disorders with respect to the associated anomalies and the absence of any hematologic or chromosomal aberrations.\n",
      "To identify the gene responsible for 14q32-linked dominant spinal muscular atrophy with lower extremity predominance (SMA-LED, OMIM 158600).Target exon capture and next generation sequencing was used to analyze the 73 genes in the 14q32 linkage interval in 3 SMA-LED family members. Candidate gene sequencing in additional dominant SMA families used PCR and pooled target capture methods. Patient fibroblasts were biochemically analyzed.Regional exome sequencing of all candidate genes in the 14q32 interval in the original SMA-LED family identified only one missense mutation that segregated with disease state-a mutation in the tail domain of DYNC1H1 (I584L). Sequencing of DYNC1H1 in 32 additional probands with lower extremity predominant SMA found 2 additional heterozygous tail domain mutations (K671E and Y970C), confirming that multiple different mutations in the same domain can cause a similar phenotype. Biochemical analysis of dynein purified from patient-derived fibroblasts demonstrated that the I584L mutation dominantly disrupted dynein complex stability and function.We demonstrate that mutations in the tail domain of the heavy chain of cytoplasmic dynein (DYNC1H1) cause spinal muscular atrophy and provide experimental evidence that a human DYNC1H1 mutation disrupts dynein complex assembly and function. DYNC1H1 mutations were recently found in a family with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (type 2O) and in a child with mental retardation. Both of these phenotypes show partial overlap with the spinal muscular atrophy patients described here, indicating that dynein dysfunction is associated with a range of phenotypes in humans involving neuronal development and maintenance.\n",
      "Interstitial deletions of the long arm of chromosome 9 are rare and most patients have been detected by conventional cytogenetic techniques. Disparities in size and localization are large and no consistent region of overlap has been delineated. We report two similar de novo deletions of 6.3 Mb involving the 9q31.1q31.3 region, identified in two monozygotic twins and one unrelated patient through array-CGH analysis. By cloning the deletion breakpoints, we could show that these deletions are not mediated by segmental duplications. The patients displayed a distinct clinical phenotype characterized by mild intellectual disability, short stature with high body mass index, thick hair, arched eyebrows, flat profile with broad chin and mild prognathism, broad, and slightly overhanging tip of the nose, short neck with cervical gibbus. The twin patients developed a metabolic syndrome (type 2 diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, vascular hypertension) during the third decade of life. Although long-term follow-up and collection of additional patients will be needed to obtain a better definition of the phenotype, our findings characterize a previously undescribed syndromic disorder associated with haploinsufficiency of the chromosome 9q31.1q31.3 region.\n",
      "Three sisters aged 16, 12 and 8 years from a consanguineous family presented with a progressive spinocerebellar ataxia combined with moderate mental retardation, progressive sensorineural hearing loss and signs of both upper and lower motor neuron disease. The patients represent the only known cases of the ataxia-deafness-retardation syndrome (McKusick #20885) except for the three brothers in the original description by Berman et al (1973). In the family described here transmission of the disease appears to be linked with occurrence of red hair colour.\n",
      "We report on 2 sibs with a previously unreported type of mesomelia of the upper limbs due to ulnar hypoplasia. Prenatal diagnosis was made by ultrasound during one pregnancy and an affected fetus was confirmed. This family documents a previously unreported autosomal recessive syndrome.\n",
      "The axonal type 2 Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT2) is phenotypically poorly characterized. Here the authors report a family with a Pro22Ser mutation in the neurofilament-light gene (NF-L; CMT2E) manifesting electrophysiologically as the demyelinating type 1 CMT (CMT1) and pathologically as an axonopathy with giant axons and accumulation of disorganized NF. NF-L should be investigated in CMT2 as well as in CMT1 not associated with the usual genes PMP22, Cx32, and P0.\n",
      "Hyperostosis cranialis interna is a hereditary bone disorder that is characterized by endosteal hyperostosis and osteosclerosis of the calvaria and the skull base (OMIM 144755). The progressive bone overgrowth causes entrapment and dysfunction of cranial nerves I, II, V, VII, and VIII, its first symptoms often presenting during the second decade. This study analyzes the clinical course of 13 affected individuals of three related families (32 individuals). The disorder appears to have an autosomal-dominant transmission pattern. Facial and vestibulocochlear nerve dysfunction are most frequently reported. Surgical decompression of the accessible impaired cranial nerves is advised in the early symptomatic period or even in the presymptomatic period in high-risk individuals.\n",
      "Interstitial microdeletions of 20q chromosome are rare, only 17 patients have been reported in the literature to date. Among them, only six carried a proximal 20q11.21-q11.23 deletion, with a size ranging from 2.6 to 6.8 Mb. The existence of a 20q11.2 microdeletion syndrome has been proposed, based on five previously reported cases that displayed anomalies of the extremities, intellectual disability, feeding difficulties, craniofacial dysmorphism and variable malformations. To further characterize this syndrome, we report on six new patients with 20q11.2 microdeletions diagnosed by whole-genome array-based comparative genomic hybridization. These patient reports more precisely refined the phenotype and narrowed the minimal critical region involved in this syndrome. Careful clinical assessment confirms the distinctive clinical phenotype. The craniofacial dysmorphism consists of high forehead, frontal bossing, enophthalmos, and midface hypoplasia. We have identified a 1.62 megabase minimal critical region involved in this syndrome encompassing three genes‚ÄîGDF5, EPB41L1, andSAMHD1‚Äîwhich are strong candidates for different aspects of the phenotype. These results support that 20q11.2 microdeletion syndrome is a new contiguous gene deletion syndrome with a recognizable phenotype.\n",
      "Dysregulated endoplasmic reticulum stress and phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2Œ± (eIF2Œ±) are associated with pancreatic Œ≤-cell failure and diabetes. Here, we report the first homozygous mutation in the PPP1R15B gene (also known as constitutive repressor of eIF2Œ± phosphorylation [CReP]) encoding the regulatory subunit of an eIF2Œ±-specific phosphatase in two siblings affected by a novel syndrome of diabetes of youth with short stature, intellectual disability, and microcephaly. The R658C mutation in PPP1R15B affects a conserved amino acid within the domain important for protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) binding. The R658C mutation decreases PP1 binding and eIF2Œ± dephosphorylation and results in Œ≤-cell apoptosis. Our findings support the concept that dysregulated eIF2Œ± phosphorylation, whether decreased by mutation of the kinase (EIF2AK3) in Wolcott-Rallison syndrome or increased by mutation of the phosphatase (PPP1R15B), is deleterious to Œ≤-cells and other secretory tissues, resulting in diabetes associated with multisystem abnormalities.\n",
      "Ciliary disorders share typical features, such as polydactyly, renal and biliary cystic dysplasia, and retinitis pigmentosa, which often overlap across diagnostic entities. We report on two siblings of consanguineous parents and two unrelated children, both of unrelated parents, with co-occurrence of Joubert syndrome and Jeune asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy, an association that adds to the observation of common final patterns of malformations in ciliary disorders. Using homozygosity mapping in the siblings, we were able to exclude all known genes/loci for both syndromes except for INVS, AHI1, and three genes from the previously described Jeune locus at 15q13. No pathogenic variants were found in these genes by direct sequencing. In the third child reported, sequencing of RPGRIP1L, ARL13B, AHI1, TMEM67, OFD1, CC2D2A, and deletion analysis of NPHP1 showed no mutations. Although this study failed to identify a mutation in the patients tested, the co-occurrence of Joubert and Jeune syndromes is likely to represent a distinct entity caused by mutations in a yet to be discovered gene. The mechanisms by which certain organ systems are affected more than others in the spectrum of ciliary diseases remain largely unknown.\n",
      "Four members of a family, in which 8 suffered from diffuse palmoplantar keratoderma associated with an uncommon form of acrocyanosis, are reported. Acrocyanosis and palmoplantar keratoderma do not always occur together and, therefore, an autosomal dominant inheritance for this association is suggested.\n",
      "Oculoectodermal syndrome (OMIM 600268) is rare and characterized by aplasia cutis congenita, epibulbar dermoids, and other abnormalities. We report herein on a newly recognized patient with oculoectodermal syndrome, which is the 19th reported patient with OES. The boy aged six years demonstrated a broad clinical spectrum of this condition, including aplasia cutis congenita, epibulbar dermoids, hyperkeratotic papule, mildly enlarged cisterna magna, and an enlarged fluid space in the quadrigeminal cistern, suggesting a cyst. He also manifested anomalies not reported associated with this disorder, including systematized epidermal nevus following Blaschko's lines, hypopigmented skin lesions, and mild digital anomaly.\n",
      "Cutaneous collagenous vasculopathy is an idiopathic microangiopathy first described in 2000 by Salama and Rosenthal.It must not be confused with generalized essential telangiectasia. To date, all patients have been white men over the age of 50 years, most of whom had multiple pathologies, were taking multiple drugs, and had no family history of similar conditions or hemorrhagic disorders. The disease is characterized by the development of various numbers of telangiectases on the limbs, lower abdomen, chest, or back, with no involvement of the mucosas or nail bed. Histopathology shows dilated superficial cutaneous vessels with perivascular deposits of periodic acid-Schiff diastase-positive, eosinophilic hyaline material that exhibits positive immunoreactivity to collagen IV. We report a new case in a 68-year-old man with symmetrically distributed telangiectases on his forearms, lower abdomen, posterior thighs, lower legs, and dorsum of the feet.\n",
      "We report on a 4-year-old female who presented with unilateral sensorineural hearing loss and a concern for developmental delay. A genome-wide SNP array analysis was performed and revealed a de novo 3.2‚ÄâMb interstitial deletion of chromosome 7q31.2q31.31. This region contains thirteen protein-encoding genes. It is unknown whether haploinsufficiency of any of these genes is responsible for the clinical features of our patient. We reviewed, the clinical phenotype of a previously published 7q31.3 deletion patient and 18 additional patients with overlapping 7q31 deletions listed in the DECIPHER database. The most consistent feature in these patients and our proband is delayed speech and language development. Hearing loss is presented both in our proband and the published 7q31.3 patient. Our study suggests that a small region on chromosome 7q31.3 encompassing four genes, CFTR, CTTNBP2, NAA38, and ANKRD7, may represent a new locus for congenital hearing loss and/or speech development. ¬© 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\n",
      "A 1.5-year-old boy with macrocephaly due to a Dandy-Walker malformation presented with progressive hydrocephalus, extensive muscular hypotonia, transient cholestatic syndrome, extensive coagulation abnormalities and elevated creatine kinase indicating myopathy. Diagnostic work-up indicated a congenital disorder of glycosylation (CDG, formerly carbohydrate deficient glycoprotein syndrome). The serum transferrin pattern obtained by automated isoelectric focusing (IEF) showed an hitherto unreported pattern with strongly elevated tri-, di-, mono- and asialotransferrin bands, increasing in this order together with markedly decreased tetrasialotransferrin. Investigation of two additional glycoproteins, alpha(1)-antitrypsin and alpha(1)-antichymotrypsin, confirmed a generalised defect of glycosylation. All known glycosylation defects could be ruled out by enzymatic analyses in either leukocytes or fibroblasts or by the results obtained by IEF. SDS-electrophoresis demonstrated a marked difference in the molecular weight of transferrin, suggesting the lack of parts or of all oligosaccharide chains. The defect could be delineated to a deficiency of beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase (E.C.2.4.1.38) due to a homozygous insertion (1031 - 1032 insC). Details of the biochemical and molecular findings will be described elsewhere.\n",
      "Diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis is a rare variant of mast cell disease with widespread erythroderma, which is normally clinically apparent in early infancy. We report the case of a neonate who presented with diffuse erythrodermic rash and bullous lesions. Biopsy specimens showed a dense dermal infiltrate of mast cells. Serum histamine and tryptase levels were elevated. No somatic mutation of the c-kit gene was found. Blistering ceased at 5 months of age, but atopic dermatitis appeared at 6 months and allergic workup revealed a high level of food-specific IgE. Herein, we describe the case and provide the first review of the literature on neonatal onset diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis to clarify the prognosis of this condition.\n",
      "Dyspigmentation along the Blaschko lines is strongly suggestive of a mosaic skin disorder. We report a 9-year-old male patient who presented with swirls and streaks of both hypo and hyperpigmentation involving the entire body. Additionally, he had hypertrichosis, musculoskeletal and minor neurodevelopment abnormalities but no intellectual disability. Cultured fibroblast displayed trisomy 7 mosaicism, which can explain this pigmentary phenotype. Widespread dyspigmentation associated with involvement of other organs should prompt systemic examination to detect additional anomalies and genetic evaluation should be considered, even with normal fetal karyotype.\n",
      "Two brothers are described with ichthyosis, hepatosplenomegaly and signs of cerebellar degeneration. The ichthyosis was similar to autosomal dominant ichthyosis both clinically and biochemically.

      "Co-occurrence of aplasia cutis congenita and nevus sebaceus has sometimes been observed.We propose a genetic mechanism that may explain this coexistence of two different congenital skin disorders.We review 15 cases as reported in the literature and present an additional case. To explain the temporal and spatial proximity of the two skin lesions we advance the concept of twin spotting for which we propose the term didymosis (Greek didymos = twin). In an embryo heterozygous for two different recessive mutations localized on either of a pair of homologous chromosomes, an event of somatic recombination would occur at an early developmental stage, giving rise to two different cell clones homozygous for either mutation.The concept of didymosis aplasticosebacea is so far hypothetical. Future molecular research may show whether this concept holds true.\n",
      "A son and daughter of consanguineous Ashkenazi Jewish parents presented with phenotypic features that are typically seen in Zellweger syndrome: high forehead, broad nasal bridge, epicanthal fold, upslanting palpebral fissures, and micrognathia. In addition to the physical anomalies, they also have severe psychomotor retardation and hypotonia. However, results of peroxisomal studies including very long chain fatty acids and plasmalogen functions, were normal. There was partial deficiency of respiratory chain complexes. We suggest that this is a new autosomal recessive syndrome that could be due to a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial defect.\n",
      "Accelerated aging syndromes represent a valuable source of information about the molecular mechanisms involved in normal aging. Here, we describe a progeroid syndrome that partially phenocopies Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) but also exhibits distinctive features, including the absence of cardiovascular deficiencies characteristic of HGPS, the lack of mutations in LMNA and ZMPSTE24, and a relatively long lifespan of affected individuals. Exome sequencing and molecular analysis in two unrelated families allowed us to identify a homozygous mutation in BANF1 (c.34G>A [p.Ala12Thr]), encoding barrier-to-autointegration factor 1 (BAF), as the molecular abnormality responsible for this Mendelian disorder. Functional analysis showed that fibroblasts from both patients have a dramatic reduction in BAF protein levels, indicating that the p.Ala12Thr mutation impairs protein stability. Furthermore, progeroid fibroblasts display profound abnormalities in the nuclear lamina, including blebs and abnormal distribution of emerin, an interaction partner of BAF. These nuclear abnormalities are rescued by ectopic expression of wild-type BANF1, providing evidence for the causal role of this mutation. These data demonstrate the utility of exome sequencing for identifying the cause of rare Mendelian disorders and underscore the importance of nuclear envelope alterations in human aging.\n",
      "This report describes a large consanguineous family with muscular dystrophy in 23 patients showing intrafamilial variation of clinical expression. One main variant appeared in the first decade with proximal muscle weakness progressing over the next 20 years to wheelchair confinement, and appeared compatible with classical limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. The other main variant showed onset of distal muscle weakness in lower limbs in the third or fourth decade, progressing very slowly without greater disability throughout the lifetime. Tibial muscle weakness and wasting were clinical landmarks in this variant, but computed tomography of skeletal muscle revealed focal areas of fatty degeneration also in truncal, pelvifemoral, and distal leg muscles in a way not previously reported in distal myopathy. The overall difference in clinical findings between these main variants would suggest 2 separate genetic entities, genealogical data makes a common genetic background possible.\n",

      "We report identical twins with supernumerary ring chromosome 19 mosaicism, who had severe refractory epilepsy at an early age. The epilepsy was dominated largely by severe life-threatening tonic seizures. Both twins died, likely as a consequence of their severe epilepsy. They displayed no dysmorphic features. Eight cases of ring chromosome 19 have been reported in the literature, all to our knowledge without epilepsy. The clinical picture of these twins emphasizes the importance of carrying out a karyotype study on patients with early-onset epilepsy even in the absence of dysmorphic features.\n",
      "We report on 2 Mennonite sisters with a syndrome of sparse hair, osteopenia, mental retardation, minor facial abnormalities, joint laxity, and hypotonia. Their asymptomatic consanguineous parents (inbreeding coefficient F = 1/64) have 6 other offspring, 3 of whom died in infancy of type II osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), and 3 of whom are normal. We analyzed collagens synthesized by cultured fibroblasts from these 2 sisters and their parents and detected no major abnormalities. Results of chromosomal and metabolic evaluations including amino acid analysis of plasma, urine, and hair were unremarkable. A literature search and survey of a computerized syndrome identification database did not disclose an identical phenotype. The sisters bear superficial resemblance to several known syndromes which we excluded on clinical and/or biochemical grounds. We conclude that they represent a new autosomal recessive syndrome, distinct from type II OI and perhaps unique to the Mennonite population or to this particular family.\n",
      "Screened for by all state newborn screening (NBS) programs in the United States, mitochondrial acetoacetyl-coenzyme A thiolase (T2), or √é¬≤-ketothiolase, deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder that causes ketoacidosis and hypoglycemia/hyperglycemia. Outcomes vary from normal development to severe cognitive impairment or even death after an acute episode of ketoacidosis. The classical biochemical profile of T2 deficiency is a result of null mutations in both alleles of the ACAT1 gene and consists of persistently increased urinary excretion of ketones, characteristic organic acids, and tiglylglycine as well as abnormal blood or plasma acylcarnitine profiles in acute and stable conditions. Early diagnosis and aggressive management can prevent further episodes of ketoacidosis and lead to normal development. We report the cases of 3 children, all subsequently found to have mutations predicted to be associated with no residual T2 enzymatic activity, but only 1 was identified by NBS in Minnesota since 2001. To our knowledge, this is the first description of compound heterozygotes for null mutations associated with no enzymatic activity exhibiting normal urinary organic acid, blood, and plasma acylcarnitine profiles when clinically well, thereby explaining the false-negative NBS results. We suggest that T2 deficiency may be underrecognized, because the incidence of T2 deficiency in Minnesota, on the basis of these 3 cases, is 1 in 232 000, higher than the reported <1 in 1 million incidence. Our cases emphasize that T2 deficiency must be considered in patients who present with ketoacidosis disproportionately severe to the triggering illness despite normal NBS results or nonspecific biochemical findings in blood and urine during asymptomatic periods.\n",
      "A Mexican mestizo family is reported in which two opposite sexed sibs, born to consanguineous parents, had a skeletal dysplasia. The salient features were a bell shaped thorax owing to short ribs, short limbed dwarfism, pelvic hypoplasia, dislocatable radial heads, elongated distal fibulae, and improvement with age. It is concluded that the present observation probably represents a distinct autosomal recessive thoraco-limb dysplasia identifiable at birth.\n",
      "Congenital radio-ulnar synostosis may be an isolated abnormality or additional abnormalities may accompany it. It may also be found as a part of well-known syndromes. We present a case with bilateral congenital radio-ulnar synostosis, speech delay, dimple on shoulders, caf√© au lait spot and characteristic facial appearance. The proband has a brother with similar clinical findings with the exception of congenital radio-ulnar synostosis. We discuss the possible relationship between our case and previously described syndromes with congenital radio-ulnar synostosis, and distinct phenotypic features of the presented case.\n",
      "A familial cerebral malformation combined with chronic hypernatremia is reported. We found three children of a Moroccan family with microcephaly and hypoplasia of the frontal brain. The frontal parts of the lateral ventricles were absent. Two of the children had a defect of the midline structures with fusion of the lateral ventricles similar to holoprosencephaly. Further clinical symptoms were generalized spasticity, delay of mental development and hypodipsia.\n",
      "Interruption of the aortic arch is a rare congenital disease. It is defined by the complete interruption between the ascending and descending aorta. A patent ductus arteriosus is necessary to maintain flow from the pulmonary to the descending aorta. Its closure leads to a cardiovascular collapse and this malformation is therefore duct-dependent. However, in rare cases, survival remains possible even after ductus arteriosus closure. We report such a case.\n",
      "RFT1-CDG is a rare N-glycosylation disorder. Only 6 children with RFT1-CDG have been described, all with failure to thrive, feeding problems, hypotonia, developmental delay, epilepsy, decreased vision, deafness and thrombotic complications. We report on two young adult siblings with RFT1-CDG, compound heterozygotes for the novel missense mutations c.1222A>G (p.M408V) and c.1325G>A (p.R442Q) in RFT1 gene. Similar to the previously described patients, these siblings have profound intellectual disability but no feeding problems or failure to thrive. Their epilepsy is well controlled and coagulopathy is mild without clinical consequences. In addition, visual acuity is normal in both patients and hearing impairment is present only in one. Our findings extend the phenotype associated with RFT1-CDG.\n",
      "The primary dystonias are a genetically heterogeneous group of disorders that can be subdivided in pure dystonias, dystonia-plus syndromes, and paroxymal dystonia. Four pure autosomal dominant dystonia loci have been mapped to date, DYT1, 6, 7, and 13, with varying penetrance. We report the mapping of a novel locus for a late-onset form of pure torsion dystonia in a family from northern Sweden. The disease is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner with a penetrance that may be as high as 90%. The torsion dystonia locus in this family was mapped to chromosome 2q14.3-q21.3 using an Illumina linkage panel. We also confirmed the linkage, using ten tightly linked microsatellite markers in the region, giving a maximum LOD score of 5.59 for marker D2S1260. The disease-critical region is 3.6-8.9 Mb depending on the disease status of one individual carrying a centromeric recombination. Mutational analysis was performed on 22 genes in the disease-critical region, including all known and hypothetical genes in the smaller, 3.6-Mb region, but no disease-specific mutations were identified. Copy number variation analysis of the region did not reveal any deletions or duplications. In order to increase the chances of finding the disease gene, fine-mapping may be necessary to decrease the region of interest. This report will hopefully result in the identification of additional dystonia families with linkage to the same locus, and thereby, refinement of the disease critical region.\n",
      "Stromme syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by microcephaly, anterior ocular chamber anomalies, and \"apple peel\" type jejunal atresia. Here, we report a Stromme syndrome family with two affected siblings with a homozygous truncating frameshift mutation in CENPF. A 3-month-old girl was hospitalized due to prenatally diagnosed microcephaly, microphthalmia, and dysmorphological features. The history of a previous child with the same findings in addition to \"apple peel\" intestinal atresia had been noted. Regarding the clinical features of both affected siblings, a diagnosis of Stromme syndrome was established. Exome-sequencing of these two cases showed the homozygous mutation (c.5912_5913insA)/(p.T1974Nfs*9) in CENPF. While confirmation of this gene being responsible for Stromme syndrome was pending our results, Filges et al. reported that CENPF was indeed underlying the reason for Stromme syndrome. This is the second case report identifying CENPF mutation as the cause of Stromme syndrome.\n",
      "We report a distinct type of spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia seen in 2 sibs and their second cousin, characterized by early onset severe short stature, small chest, and distended abdomen. They had short neck, severe lumbar lordosis, and marked genu varum due to fibular overgrowth and joint laxity. Radiographically, the patients had platyspondyly, initially noted during the first years of life, with central hypoplasia of the vertebral bodies. At a later age, the vertebrae appear squared with mild interpedicular narrowing. The long bone changes, which at early age resemble those seen in achondroplasia, later include general metaphyseal irregularities and significant epiphyseal ossification delay. These patients present a previously undescribed form of spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia, most probably transmitted as an autosomal recessive tract.\n",
      "Fryns anophthalmia-plus syndrome is a rare syndrome with clinical diversity primarily including anophthalmia/microphthalmia, facial clefts, cleft lip/palate, ear and nasal deformities. Here we present two different cases of APS with anopthalmia/microphthalmia, cleft palate, low set ears, ventriculomegaly and one of which had intestinal non-fixation anomaly not described in the literature before.\n",
      "Biliary and pancreatic ductal systems can be involved in several lymphoplasmacytic inflammatory conditions, including primary sclerosing cholangitis, immunoglobulin G (IgG) 4-related cholangitis and autoimmune pancreatitis. Here in we describe an unusual pancreatocholangitis whose features suggest a distinct disease entity.The study group consists of five adult patients, three with predominantly hilar bile duct stricture and two with a bulky pancreatic head. Four patients were treated surgically for suspected malignancy and one patient underwent liver transplantation with a clinical diagnosis of primary sclerosing cholangitis. Histological examination revealed extensive lymphoplasmacytic inflammation centred on large biliary or pancreatic ducts. Many lymphoid follicles with germinal centres were noted around the affected ducts. Whipple specimens from two patients with a pancreatic head mass showed similar follicular inflammation histologically around bile ducts. In contrast to autoimmune pancreatitis, diffuse infiltration of IgG4(+) plasma cells, granulocytic epithelial lesions and obliterative phlebitis were not identified. The postoperative course was uneventful, without evidence of recurrence (follow-up period 17-65 months).This study suggests that a disease entity which can be named follicular cholangitis and pancreatitis exists and may be under-recognized. The disease mainly affects the hilar bile ducts and pancreatic head in adults.\n",
      "Here, we report a newly recognized syndrome in three siblings with occipital atretic cephalocele, striking facial anomalies, and large feet. Specific findings include occipital atretic cephalocele, hypoplastic cerebellar vermis, Dandy-Walker variant, mental deficiency, prominent forehead, midface deficiency, broad nose and nasal root, grooved nasal tip, abnormal nares, narrow malformed ears, severe oligodontia, and large wide feet with a gap between the hallux and the second toe. The phenotype is variable in the three patients. The finding of three affected siblings of a consanguineous couple strongly suggests autosomal recessive inheritance.\n",
      "We report on a distinct pattern of primary central nervous system (CNS) degeneration affecting neuronal survival in the brain and spinal cord in 5 fetuses with fetal akinesia sequence (FAS). This neuropathological pattern is characteristic of a lethal entity that we propose calling type III lissencephaly syndrome. Parental consanguinity and the recurrence in sibs support a genetic cause. The mechanism of neuronal death is not yet understood; abnormal apoptosis and/or deficiency in neurotropic factors may be considered possible causes.\n",
      "We studied five individuals from three Jewish Bukharian families affected by an apparently autosomal-recessive form of hereditary spastic paraparesis accompanied by severe intellectual disability, fluctuating central hypoventilation, gastresophageal reflux disease, wake apnea, areflexia, and unique dysmorphic features. Exome sequencing identified one homozygous variant shared among all affected individuals and absent in controls: a 1 bp frameshift TECPR2 deletion leading to a premature stop codon and predicting significant degradation of the protein. TECPR2 has been reported as a positive regulator of autophagy. We thus examined the autophagy-related fate of two key autophagic proteins, SQSTM1 (p62) and MAP1LC3B (LC3), in skin fibroblasts of an affected individual, as compared to a healthy control, and found that both protein levels were decreased and that there was a more pronounced decrease in the lipidated form of LC3 (LC3II). siRNA knockdown of TECPR2 showed similar changes, consistent with aberrant autophagy. Our results are strengthened by the fact that autophagy dysfunction has been implicated in a number of other neurodegenerative diseases. The discovered TECPR2 mutation implicates autophagy, a central intracellular mechanism, in spastic paraparesis.\n",
      "Eiken syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive skeletal dysplasia. We identified a truncation mutation in the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of the parathyroid hormone (PTH)/PTH-related peptide (PTHrP) type 1 receptor (PTHR1) gene as the cause of this syndrome. Eiken syndrome differs from Jansen and Blomstrand chondrodysplasia and from enchondromatosis, which are all syndromes caused by PTHR1 mutations. Notably, the skeletal features are opposite to those in Blomstrand chondrodysplasia, which is caused by inactivating recessive mutations in PTHR1. To our knowledge, this is the first description of opposite manifestations resulting from distinct recessive mutations in the same gene.\n",
      "The Fc receptor on NK cells, FcŒ≥RIIIA (CD16), has been extensively studied for its role in mediating antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). A homozygous missense mutation in CD16 (encoding a L66H substitution) is associated with severe herpesvirus infections in rare patients. Here, we identified a new patient with this CD16 mutation and compared the patient's NK cells to those of the originally reported patient. Patients with the L66H mutation had intact ADCC, but deficient spontaneous NK cell cytotoxicity and decreased surface expression of CD2, a coactivation receptor. Mechanistic studies in a human NK cell line, NK-92, demonstrated that CD16 expression correlated with CD2 surface levels and enabled killing of a melanoma cell line typically resistant to CD16-deficient NK-92 cells. An association between CD16 and CD2 was identified biochemically and at the immunological synapse, which elicited CD16 signaling after CD2 engagement. Stable expression of CD16 L66H in NK-92 cells recapitulated the patient phenotype, abrogating association of CD16 with CD2 as well as CD16 signaling after CD2 ligation. Thus, CD16 serves a role in NK cell-mediated spontaneous cytotoxicity through a specific association with CD2 and represents a potential mechanism underlying a human congenital immunodeficiency.\n",
      "We report on prenatal and postnatal findings in 4 consecutive fetuses with a pattern of severe congenital anomalies who were born to a healthy nonconsanguineous couple. The spectrum of malformations includes diaphragmatic defects, hypoplastic lungs, omphalocele, limb deficiencies, syndactyly of toes, and ossification defects of the skull. This specific spectrum of anomalies is not fully compatible with that of any established syndrome. No prenatal exposure to any possible teratogen was found. Family history is suggestive for autosomal recessive inheritance, even though germ-line mosaicism in one of the parents cannot completely be excluded.\n",
      "Age-related degenerative and malignant diseases represent major challenges for health care systems. Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying carcinogenesis and age-associated pathologies is thus of growing biomedical relevance. We identified biallelic germline mutations in SPRTN (also called C1orf124 or DVC1) in three patients from two unrelated families. All three patients are affected by a new segmental progeroid syndrome characterized by genomic instability and susceptibility toward early onset hepatocellular carcinoma. SPRTN was recently proposed to have a function in translesional DNA synthesis and the prevention of mutagenesis. Our in vivo and in vitro characterization of identified mutations has uncovered an essential role for SPRTN in the prevention of DNA replication stress during general DNA replication and in replication-related G2/M-checkpoint regulation. In addition to demonstrating the pathogenicity of identified SPRTN mutations, our findings provide a molecular explanation of how SPRTN dysfunction causes accelerated aging and susceptibility toward carcinoma.\n",
      "We report a new case of frontofacionasal dysplasia or dysostosis (FFND) with a 1.5 Mb duplication in the region of 7p15.2-p15.1, and provide a review of the literature to understand the underlying pathogenesis better.\n",
      "A chromosomally normal brother and sister shared a lethal pattern of anomalies including bilateral cleft lip and palate, hypertelorism, flat facial profile, flat occiput, complex congenital heart defect, and malrotation of the intestine. The male was large for gestational age, while his sister was normally grown. The girl had bifid thumbs, but the boy had only minor hand anomalies. These findings are not consistent with any previously recognized syndrome and represent a new condition with probable autosomal recessive inheritance.\n",
      "Partial duplications of the long arm of chromosome 3, dup(3q), are a rare but well-described condition, sharing features of Cornelia de Lange syndrome. Around two thirds of cases are derived from unbalanced translocations, whereas pure dup(3q) have rarely been reported. Here, we provide an extensive review of the literature on dup(3q). This search revealed several patients with caudal malformations and anomalies, suggesting that caudal malformations or anomalies represent an inherent phenotypic feature of dup(3q). In this context, we report a patient with a pure de novo duplication 3q26.32-q27.2. The patient had the clinical diagnosis of Currarino syndrome (CS) (characterized by the triad of sacral anomalies, anorectal malformations and a presacral mass) and additional features, frequently detected in patients with a dup(3q). Mutations within the MNX1 gene were found to be causative in CS but no MNX1 mutation could be detected in our patient. Our comprehensive search for candidate genes located in the critical region of the duplication 3q syndrome, 3q26.3-q27, revealed a so far neglected phenotypic overlap of dup(3q) and the Pierpont syndrome, associated with a mutation of the TBL1XR1 gene on 3q26.32.\n",
      "HOXD genes encode transcription factors involved in the antero-posterior patterning of the limb bud and in the specification of fingers. During the embryo development, HOXD genes are expressed, following a spatio-temporal colinearity that involves at least three regions, centrometric and telomeric to this cluster. Here, we describe a father and a daughter presenting a 3-4 hand bilateral syndactyly associated with a nystagmus. Array-comparative genomic hybridisation showed a 3.8‚ÄâMb duplication at 2q31.1-q31.2, comprising 27 genes including the entire HOXD cluster. We performed expression studies in lymphoblasts by reverse transcription-PCR and observed an HOXD13 and HOXD10 overexpression, whereas the HOXD12 expression was decreased. HOXD13 and HOXD10 overexpression, associated with a misregulation of at least HOXD12, may therefore induce the syndactyly. Deletions of the HOXD cluster and its regulatory sequences induce hand malformations and, particularly, finger anomalies. Recently, smaller duplications of the same region have been reported in association with a mesomelic dysplasia, type Kantaputra. We discuss the variable phenotypes associated with such 2q duplications.\n",
      "Hemiparkinsonism-hemiatrophy (HPHA) is a rare neurological syndrome. The main clinical features of HPHA consist of atrophy of one side of the body (face, trunk, limbs), ipsilateral hemiparkinsonism (bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor) and in many cases dystonia. There are no data on prevalence of HPHA as the condition is rare. The mean age of parkinsonism onset is earlier than in idiopathic Parkinson disease (43.7 years, range: 15-63). Changes in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (cortical, basal ganglia atrophy contralaterally to the side of clinical presentation) are described in 30% of patients. The pathogenesis of HPHA is unknown, but in many cases a history of prenatal injuries was reported. We present two male patients with HPHA - 45 and 55 years old, with left-sided parkinsonism, dystonia and hemiatrophy (to our knowledge, the first Polish cases). Both patients had no atrophic changes in MRI and levodopa treatment was ineffective. In the discussion the authors review current literature on HPHA.\n",
      "Bart-Pumphrey syndrome (BPS) is an autosomal-dominant disorder characterized by hearing loss, leukonychia, knuckle pads and palmoplantar keratoderma. Two mutations in the extracellular domain of GBJ2 are resposible for this syndrome. To date, less than 10 case reports or clinical series about BPS have been published in the literature. Hearing loss and knuckle pads are the more commonly seen findings of this syndrome. Three generations and six family members with variable findings of knuckle pads, leukonychia, hearing loss and palmoplantar hyperkeratosis were presented in this report. We want to emphasize that dermatogists must be alert during the evaluation of these findings because some findings of this disorder may be vague or absent.\n",
      "BACKGROUND:The association of Blaschko lines with genetic mosaicism has lead to the concept that this pattern represents the manifestation of genetically abnormal skin tissue contrasting with the genetically normal skin. Various mosaic defects affecting not only the skin but also extracutaneous tissues have lead to the description of different types of epidermal nevus syndromes. We present a further case of an unusual organoid epidermal nevus characterized by depigmented hypertrichosis. MAIN OBSERVATIONS:We describe a 2-year-old boy with a systematized angora hair nevus being characterized by bands covered with soft white hair arranged along Blaschko's lines, involving the scalp, face, and trunk. A biopsy obtained from a scalp lesion showed mild epidermal acanthosis and increased pigmentation of the basal layer. Trichoscopy the affected scalp hair demonstrated fine light coloured shafts. The boy had slight macrocephaly and body asymmetry, a sacral pit, and koilonychia of the big toes. CONCLUSIONS:The angora hair nevus is a peculiar type of organoid epidermal nevus, representing the cutaneous hallmark of a distinctive syndrome, the angora hair nevus syndrome (Schauder syndrome). In cases of epidermal nevi showing hypertrichosis, this unusual entity should be borne in mind for differential diagnosis.\n",
      "A woman with a menstrual cycle-dependent fever (more than 38 degrees C) and severe fatigue that disrupted her ability to work was referred to our hospital. Six years ago, the patient received interferon beta injections (6,000,000 IU day-1x48 days) for the treatment of hepatitis C virus. Although the treatment was successful against the virus, the symptomatic fever occurred monthly since the third year after receiving the treatment. The symptoms occurred a few days after ovulation in every menstrual cycle. When the ovarian function was suppressed by GnRH agonist (GnRHa), the symptoms disappeared. While in anovulation, the patient received estrogen followed by estrogen with progestogen, which resembles the sex hormone milieu of a normal menstrual cycle without the LH surge; this treatment did not induce the symptoms. When human CG (hCG) was injected on the beginning day of estrogen with progestogen following treatment with estrogen alone, the previous symptoms reappeared. However, the hCG injection without estrogen priming did not induce the symptoms. These studies indicated that the LH surge after estrogen priming induced the symptoms. Changes in serum inflammatory cytokine levels (interleukin-1, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha) were examined during the ovulatory cycle and the interleukin-1 levels during the treatment. There were no significant changes on these levels in the febrile period. The patient experienced normal menstrual cycles after finishing the five-month GnRHa treatment. Although her symptoms still occur, they are mild and do not require further medical treatment.\n",
      "Three siblings, a boy and two girls aged 11, 9, and 4 years, were found to have a congenital disorder characterized by malformed, low-set ears and sensorineural-conductive hearing loss. Variable expressivity was evident, since the boy had both types I and III of microtia and his two sisters had only type I. The normal parents were third cousins. The analysis of these findings permits the identification of a distinct nosologic entity due to the homozygocity of an autosomal recessive mutation.\n",
      "Calcineurin is a calcium (Ca2+)/calmodulin-regulated protein phosphatase that mediates Ca2+-dependent signal transduction. Here, we report six heterozygous mutations in a gene encoding the alpha isoform of the calcineurin catalytic subunit (PPP3CA). Notably, mutations were observed in different functional domains: in addition to three catalytic domain mutations, two missense mutations were found in the auto-inhibitory (AI) domain. One additional frameshift insertion that caused premature termination was also identified. Detailed clinical evaluation of the six individuals revealed clinically unexpected consequences of the PPP3CA mutations. First, the catalytic domain mutations and frameshift mutation were consistently found in patients with nonsyndromic early onset epileptic encephalopathy. In contrast, the AI domain mutations were associated with multiple congenital abnormalities including craniofacial dysmorphism, arthrogryposis and short stature. In addition, one individual showed severe skeletal developmental defects, namely, severe craniosynostosis and gracile bones (severe bone slenderness and perinatal fractures). Using a yeast model system, we showed that the catalytic and AI domain mutations visibly result in decreased and increased calcineurin signaling, respectively. These findings indicate that different functional effects of PPP3CA mutations are associated with two distinct disorders and suggest that functional approaches using a simple cellular system provide a tool for resolving complex genotype-phenotype correlations.\n",
      "Dehydrated hereditary stomatocytosis, also known as \"hereditary xerocytosis,\" is caused by a red blood cell-membrane defect characterized by stomatocytic morphology, increased mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, decreased osmotic fragility, increased permeability to the univalent cations Na+ and K+, and an increased proportion of phosphatidylcholine in the membrane. The clinical presentation is heterogeneous, ranging from mild to moderate hemolytic anemia associated with scleral icterus, splenomegaly, and choletithiasis. Iron overload may develop later in life. The disease is transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait. We recruited a large three-generation Irish family affected with DHS and comprising 23 members, of whom 14 were affected and 9 were healthy. Two additional, small families also were included in the study. The DNA samples from the family members were used in a genomewide search to identify, by linkage analysis, the DHS locus. After the exclusion of a portion of the human genome, we obtained conclusive evidence for linkage of DHS to microsatellite markers on the long arm of chromosome 16 (16q23-q24). A maximum two-point LOD score of 6.62 at recombination fraction .00 was obtained with marker D16S520. There are no recombination events defining the telomeric limit of the region, which therefore is quite large. No candidate genes map to this area.\n",
      "We report on a girl and her mother with delayed intramembranous ossification of the cranial vault. The 11-month-old girl had a large ossification defect involving parietal bones, squamous portion of temporal bones, and interparietal region of occipital bone, while the mother showed a complete ossified cranial vault with flat posterior parietal region and prominent occiput. Both had a similar face characterized by frontal bossing, hypertelorism, downward slant of palpebral fissures, flat nasal bridge, and short midface. On reviewing the literature, we concluded that these cases may be a dominant transmitted ossification defect with characteristic face, different from the cranium bifidum-parietal foramina entity.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To report a new familial case of the recently described autosomal recessive syndrome of nanophthalmos-retinitis pigmentosa-foveoschisis-optic disc drusen, which arises from compound heterozygosity for Membrane Frizzled-Related Protein (MFRP) mutations in a sibling pair of Mexican origin. METHODS: Ophthalmological assessment included slit-lamp and dilated fundus examination, applanation tonometry, fundus photography, A-mode and B-mode ultrasound examination, electroretinogram, fluorescein retinal angiography, optical coherence tomography, and electrooculogram in both affected siblings. Molecular genetic analysis consisted of PCR amplification and direct automated sequence of the complete coding region of the MFRP gene. In addition, allele-specific cloning and sequencing techniques were used to characterize a heterozygous MFRP frameshift mutation. RESULTS: Clinical examination revealed high hyperopia of > +16 diopters while electroretinographic and fluorangiographic studies demonstrated a retinal dystrophy compatible with retinitis pigmentosa. Ultrasound examination showed nanophthalmos (eye axial length <15 mm) and optic disc drusen while optical coherence tomography evidenced cystoid macular edema. Nucleotide sequencing in DNA from both affected siblings disclosed the presence of two MFRP mutations: a novel heterozygous point mutation predicting a nonsense change from tyrosine (TAC) to a stop signal (TAA) at codon 317, and a heterozygous 1 bp deletion in exon 5, predicting a prematurely truncated protein (p.Asn167ThrfsX25). DISCUSSION: The third known family with the syndrome of nanophthalmos-retinitis pigmentosa-foveoschisis-optic disc drusen is presented. This is the first demonstration of compound heterozygosity for MFRP mutations as the source of the disease. The affected siblings described here are the youngest patients with the disease reported to date and the comparison of their clinical data with previous individuals with this syndrome suggest that some aspects of the phenotype are probably age-dependent.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE:To report novel disease and pathology due to HSPB8 mutations in 2 families with autosomal dominant distal neuromuscular disease showing both myofibrillar and rimmed vacuolar myopathy together with neurogenic changes. METHODS:We performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) in tandem with linkage analysis and candidate gene approach as well as targeted next-generation sequencing (tNGS) to identify causative mutations in 2 families with dominant rimmed vacuolar myopathy and a motor neuropathy. Pathogenic variants and familial segregation were confirmed using Sanger sequencing. RESULTS:WES and tNGS identified a heterozygous change in HSPB8 in both families: c.421A > G p.K141E in family 1 and c.151insC p.P173SfsX43 in family 2. Affected patients had a distal myopathy that showed myofibrillar aggregates and rimmed vacuoles combined with a clear neurogenic component both on biopsy and neurophysiologic studies. MRI of lower limb muscles demonstrated diffuse tissue changes early in the disease stage progressing later to fatty replacement typical of a myopathy. CONCLUSION:We expand the understanding of disease mechanisms, tissue involvement, and phenotypic outcome of HSPB8 mutations. HSPB8 is part of the chaperone-assisted selective autophagy (CASA) complex previously only associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2L (OMIM 60673) and distal hereditary motor neuronopathy type IIa. However, we now demonstrate that patients can develop a myopathy with histologic features of myofibrillar myopathy with aggregates and rimmed vacuoles, similar to the pathology in myopathies due to gene defects in other compounds of the CASA complex such as BAG3 and DNAJB6 after developing the early neurogenic effects.\n",
      "Gardner-Silengo-Wachtel or genito-palato-cardiac syndrome is a disorder of male (46,XY) gonadal dysgenesis, thought to be either an X-linked recessive or an autosomal recessive disorder. The propositus in our report presented with multiple congenital anomalies including micrognathia, cleft palate, congenital heart defect with D-transposition, double outlet right ventricle, PFO, VSD, PDA and pulmonary valve stenosis and gonadal dysgenesis. Chromosome analysis showed a 46, XY, t(1;7)(q32,q22.1) der(10) t(3;10) (q21;q26)pat karyotype. This represents a rare case of autosomal aneuploidy associated with Gardner-Silengo-Wachtel or genito-palato-cardiac syndrome and suggests genetic heterogeneity for this syndrome. Partial monosomy of 10q also shares many of the prominent features of genito-palato-cardiac syndrome, including gonadal dysgenesis, cardiac defects and facial features. Monosomy for distal 10q may present as a phenocopy of Gardner-Silengo-Wachtel or genito-palato-cardiac syndrome. Alternatively, unmasking of a recessive allele on distal 10q may result in genito-palato-cardiac syndrome, thus potentially localizing a candidate region for the gene to 10q26 --> qter.\n",
      "The WHIM syndrome is a rare congenital immunodeficiency disorder characterized by human papillomavirus (HPV)-induced warts, hypogammaglobulinemia, bacterial infections and myelokathexis. Myelokathexis refers to abnormal retention of mature neutrophils in the bone marrow leading to severe neutropenia. We report the case of a 20 year old man presenting with chronic and severe neutropenia since early childhood without established diagnosis. He was addressed for chronic parodontal disease treatment. Examination of bone marrow smear showed morphological abnormalities of mature neutrophils strongly suggestive of myelokathexis. Diagnosis of WHIM syndrome was confirmed by molecular analysis: a nonsense mutation was identified in the gene encoding CXCR4, the CXCL12 (or SDF-1) chemokine receptor which notably controls cell adhesion to the marrow stroma and thereby regulates mature leukocytes release from the bone marrow. Treatment of the disease usually consists in prophylactic anti-infective measures including intravenous immunoglobulins administration, oral antibiotic prophylaxis and more recently HPV vaccination. Long term G-CSF therapy did not show any significant efficiency in preventing recurrent infections. The use of specific CXCR4 antagonist is being currently evaluated.\n",
      "Ectodermal dysplasias are a large and heterogeneous groups of clinically and genetically distinct syndromes. We studied a family suffering from dystrophies of the distal part of the nails and trichodysplasia. Scalp, beard, pubic and axillary hair were broken off leaving a stubble 1-10 mm in length. Eyebrows, eyelashes and body hair were completely absent. Serum levels of copper and plasma levels of amino acids were within the normal range. Inheritance was autosomal recessive. Previous reports of ectodermal dysplasias and other complex syndromes with pili torti are reviewed.\n",
      "Variants in CLCN4, which encodes the chloride/hydrogen ion exchanger CIC-4 prominently expressed in brain, were recently described to cause X-linked intellectual disability and epilepsy. We present detailed phenotypic information on 52 individuals from 16 families with CLCN4-related disorder: 5 affected females and 2 affected males with a de novo variant in CLCN4 (6 individuals previously unreported) and 27 affected males, 3 affected females and 15 asymptomatic female carriers from 9 families with inherited CLCN4 variants (4 families previously unreported). Intellectual disability ranged from borderline to profound. Behavioral and psychiatric disorders were common in both child- and adulthood, and included autistic features, mood disorders, obsessive-compulsive behaviors and hetero- and autoaggression. Epilepsy was common, with severity ranging from epileptic encephalopathy to well-controlled seizures. Several affected individuals showed white matter changes on cerebral neuroimaging and progressive neurological symptoms, including movement disorders and spasticity. Heterozygous females can be as severely affected as males. The variability of symptoms in females is not correlated with the X inactivation pattern studied in their blood. The mutation spectrum includes frameshift, missense and splice site variants and one single-exon deletion. All missense variants were predicted to affect CLCN4's function based on in silico tools and either segregated with the phenotype in the family or were de novo. Pathogenicity of all previously unreported missense variants was further supported by electrophysiological studies in Xenopus laevis oocytes. We compare CLCN4-related disorder with conditions related to dysfunction of other members of the CLC family.\n",
      "Multiple congenital anomalies and craniofacial dysmorphism are characterizing the so-called Emanuel or supernumerary der(22)t(11;22) syndrome (OMIM609029). Mental and developmental retardation are major clinical features. The der(22) may arise from a parental balanced t(11;22)(q23;q11.2) or can be created de novo. Here we present a 2 years old boy with normal prenatal history, cyanotic at delivery and with ear anomalies, a preauricular tag, high-arched palate and micrognathia. There were neither microcephaly, nor heart or kidney defects. Psychological and motor testing at the age of 2 years confirmed significant mental and developmental delay. In addition, the child had seizures and an abnormal electroencephalogram. Cytogenetic and molecular analyses revealed a karyotype 47,XY,+der(22)t(11;22)(q23;q11.2). As parents refused further tests it could not be determined if the der(22) arose de novo or was parentally derived. Overall the present report should alert physician to offer cytogenetic and/or molecular diagnostics in comparable cases.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Pseudo (platelet-type)-von Willebrand disease is a rare autosomal dominant bleeding disorder caused by an abnormal function of the glycoprotein lb protein; the receptor for von Willebrand factor. This leads to an increased removal of VWF multimers from the circulation as well as platelets and this results in a bleeding diathesis. Worldwide, less than 50 patients are reported with platelet type von Willebrand disease (PT-VWD). CASE PRESENTATION: We describe the management of platelet type von Willebrand disease in pregnancy of a 26 year old Caucasian primigravida. The initial diagnosis was made earlier following a significant haemorrhage post tonsillectomy several years prior to pregnancy. The patient was managed under a multidisciplinary team which included obstetricians, haematologists, anaesthetists and neonatologists. Care plans were made for the ante- natal, intra-partum and post-partum periods in partnership with the patient. The patient's platelet count levels dropped significantly during the antenatal period. This necessitated the active exclusion of other causes of thrombocytopenia in pregnancy. A vaginal delivery was desired and plans were made for induction of labour at 38 weeks of gestation with platelet cover in view of the progressive fall of the platelet count. The patient however went into spontaneous labour on the day of induction. She was transfused two units of platelets before delivery. She had an unassisted vaginal delivery of a healthy baby. The successful antenatal counselling has encouraged the diagnosis of the same condition in her mother and sister. We found this to be a particularly interesting case as well as challenging to manage due to its rarity. Psuedo von Willebrand disease in pregnancy can be confused with a number of other differential diagnoses, such as gestational thrombocutopenia, idiopathatic thrombocytopenia, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and pre-eclampsia; all need consideration during investigations even in a case such as this where the diagnosis of platelet type von Willebrand disease was known before pregnancy. CONCLUSION: Management of pseudo von Willebrand disease in pregnancy involves the co-operation of multidisciplinary teams, regular monitoring of platelet levels and factor VIII and replacement as appropriate. This case report highlights this rare condition and the need to exclude all the other differential diagnoses of thrombocytopenia in pregnant women with thrombocytopenia.\n",
      "We identified six patients presenting with a strikingly similar clinical phenotype of profound syndromic intellectual disability of unknown etiology. All patients lived in the same village. Extensive genealogical work revealed that the healthy parents of the patients were all distantly related to a common ancestor from the 17th century, suggesting autosomal recessive inheritance. In addition to intellectual disability, the clinical features included hypotonia, strabismus, difficulty to fix the eyes to an object, planovalgus in the feet, mild contractures in elbow joints, interphalangeal joint hypermobility and coarse facial features that develop gradually during childhood. The clinical phenotype did not fit any known syndrome. Genome-wide SNP genotyping of the patients and genetic mapping revealed the longest shared homozygosity at 3p22.1-3p21.1 encompassing 11.5 Mb, with no other credible candidate loci emerging. Single point parametric linkage analysis showed logarithm of the odds score of 11 for the homozygous region, thus identifying a novel intellectual disability predisposition locus. Whole-genome sequencing of one affected individual pinpointed three genes with potentially protein damaging homozygous sequence changes within the predisposition locus: transketolase (TKT), prolyl 4-hydroxylase transmembrane (P4HTM), and ubiquitin specific peptidase 4 (USP4). The changes were found in heterozygous form with 0.3-0.7% allele frequencies in 402 whole-genome sequenced controls from the north-east of Finland. No homozygotes were found in this nor additional control data sets. Our study facilitates clinical and molecular diagnosis of patients with this novel autosomal recessive intellectual disability syndrome. However, further studies are needed to unambiguously identify the underlying genetic defect.\n",
      "OBJECTIVES: The thyroglossal duct cyst (TDC) is a frequent pathology in head and neck surgery whose diagnosis and treatment are well known. Hereditary forms are very rare. In a case report, the author describes the familial cases in the international literature and discusses the genetic inheritance patterns. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The author reports the clinical case of a 7-year-old girl, operated on for a TDC, with a familial history of this disease. After a review of the international literature in PubMed, the features of the reported families are described and the genetic inheritance theories are discussed. RESULTS: This is the first report of a French familial form of TDC. Described in four members of the same family over three generations, the genetic transmission seems to follow the rules of autosomic dominant inheritance. The female preponderance suggests a genetic imprinting theory. CONCLUSION: The genetic inheritance patterns of familial TDC are unclear. The dominant autosomic transmission with incomplete penetrance might be the most likely. Another theory of genetic imprinting might explain the female preponderance, but this theory remains complex and highly debated. However, the search for a familial history of TDC must be part of the initial consultation, a procedure that is not widely known among ENT surgeons.\n",
      "Only three cases of W syndrome have been reported. These patients have a typical \"pugilistic\" face, incomplete oral cleft, absent upper incisors, mental retardation, spasticity, seizures, and acne scars. Two of them had additional skeletal anomalies. Here we report on three male patients with findings compatible with the W syndrome. We emphasize the importance of some constant findings and describe additional signs. Familial history supports X-linked dominant heredity, as postulated previously.\n",
      "PEHO syndrome is a rare progressive infantile encephalopathy, with variable age of onset of hypotonia, convulsions, mental retardation, oedema, and optic atrophy. Neuroimaging shows cerebellar and brainstem atrophy in most instances. A PEHO-like syndrome has been described in which those affected do not have the typical changes on neuroimaging. We report four new cases, two isolated cases and two sisters, who might be part of the PEHO-like syndrome.\n",
      "Megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts is an inherited autosomal recessive disorder with characteristic MRI features and a variable but mild clinical course. Frontal and temporal subcortical cysts are the diagnostic hallmark. It usually presents with pyramidal and cerebellar signs. Megalencephaly is usually detected early. Seizures may be present but are usually easily controlled. It has been reported commonly from a certain ethnicity of northern Indian origin, but its presence is global. We encountered four patients and describe the clinical and radiological features of these patients. Seizures though reported to be uncommon were seen in all our patients. Neuropsychiatric features have not been described as presentation so far but one of our patients had moderately severe depression. All the patients were diagnosed by MRI features and they responded well to symptomatic treatment.\n",
      "Neu-Laxova syndrome is a rare, lethal, autosomal recessive disorder characterized by intrauterine growth retardation, central nervous system anomalies, skin findings, such as ichthyosis, edema, collodion baby and harlequin fetus, facial dysmorphic features, limb anomalies and genital hypoplasia. Although it is generally a lethal condition, cases of such patients who lived beyond 6 months and 10 months of age have been reported. Here, we describe an 8-year-old boy who was born with collodion membrane, facial dysmorphic features, limb anomalies, genital hypoplasia and pachygyria. He had no major health problems over the course of 8 years of follow-up, except for mild mental/motor retardation, ichthyosis, facial dysmorphic features and limb anomalies. Based on these features, we suggest that because Neu-Laxova syndrome represents a heterogeneous phenotype, our case may be a milder variant of this syndrome or a new genetic entity.\n",
      "Many children with idiopathic short stature have a delayed bone age. Idiopathic short stature with advanced bone age is far less common.The aim was to identify underlying genetic causes of short stature with advanced bone age.We used whole-exome sequencing to study three families with autosomal-dominant short stature, advanced bone age, and premature growth cessation.Affected individuals presented with short stature [adult heights -2.3 to -4.2 standard deviation scores (SDS)] with histories of early growth cessation or childhood short stature (height SDS -1.9 to -3.5 SDS), advancement of bone age, and normal endocrine evaluations. Whole-exome sequencing identified novel heterozygous variants in ACAN, which encodes aggrecan, a proteoglycan in the extracellular matrix of growth plate and other cartilaginous tissues. The variants were present in all affected, but in no unaffected, family members. In Family 1, a novel frameshift mutation in exon 3 (c.272delA) was identified, which is predicted to cause early truncation of the aggrecan protein. In Family 2, a base-pair substitution was found in a highly conserved location within a splice donor site (c.2026+1G>A), which is also likely to alter the amino acid sequence of a large portion of the protein. In Family 3, a missense variant (c.7064T>C) in exon 14 affects a highly conserved residue (L2355P) and is strongly predicted to perturb protein function.Our study demonstrates that heterozygous mutations in ACAN can cause a mild skeletal dysplasia, which presents clinically as short stature with advanced bone age. The accelerating effect on skeletal maturation has not previously been noted in the few prior reports of human ACAN mutations. Our findings thus expand the spectrum of ACAN defects and provide a new molecular genetic etiology for the unusual child who presents with short stature and accelerated skeletal maturation.\n",
      "A 56-year-old black woman with full-thickness mosaic pattern central corneal cloudiness, similar in appearance to central cloudy dystrophy and posterior crocodile shagreen, underwent corneal transplantation. Atypical features included decreased vision, photophobia, and epithelial involvement, with occasional foreign body sensation. Numerous 0.5-2.0-micron-diameter lacunae were present in the corneal stroma and Bowman's layer, and a saw-toothed lamellar pattern was often evident in the corneal stroma. Soybean agglutinin (SBA), a lectin that binds N-acetyl-galactosamine residues, bound diffusely to stromal foci exhibiting similar size and distribution to the lacunae observed by electron microscopy. An absence of histochemically detectable lipid associated with these lacunae suggests that SBA reacted with glycoconjugates other than glycolipids. Biochemical analyses revealed similar contents of keratan sulfate, chondroitin/dermatan sulfate, and collagen as in normal controls, suggesting that the SBA binding moieties are associated with a glycoprotein or proteoglycan that is structurally or compositionally different from those found in normal cornea. This patient may represent an extreme variant of Vogt's or Fran√ßois central corneal clouding or a previously undescribed corneal dystrophy.\n",
      "Recessive mutations in MEGF10 (multiple epidermal growth factor 10) have been reported in a severe early onset disorder named Early Myopathy, Areflexia, Respiratory Distress and Dysphagia, and a milder form with cores in the muscle biopsy; and a possible genotype-phenotype correlation determining the clinical presentation has been suggested. We undertook exome sequencing in a 66 year old male with a 20 year history of progressive proximal and distal weakness of upper and lower limbs, facial weakness and dysphagia, who developed respiratory failure requiring ventilation while still ambulant in his 50s. Muscle biopsy demonstrated myopathic changes with aggregation of myofibrillar proteins. Mutations in MEGF10 were identified: a novel essential splice site (c.1426+1G>T) and a novel missense variant (c.352T>C, p.(Cys118Arg)). We performed a detailed review of all reported MEGF10 cases (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ20), and confirmed the presence of a genotype-phenotype correlation, namely that with ‚â•1 null mutation onset of respiratory dysfunction occurs in the first year of life, whereas with 2 missense mutations, respiratory dysfunction occurs at 10 years old or much later, as in the patient reported here. Our findings expand the phenotype of MEGF10 mutations to include onset in the 5th decade, and discuss the spectrum of MEGF10 related disease.\n",
      "Two profoundly mentally retarded, unrelated males are reported with an unidentified multiple congenital anomaly/mental retardation syndrome, including early balding, patella luxations, small hands and feet, and hypogonadism, similar to a previous publication in this journal of a severely mentally retarded male patient with dysmorphic features.\n",
      "We have studied 2 sibs with vertebral, radial, congenital heart, and ear defects. The second patient also had limb pterygia and meningomyelocele. The abnormalities in these two sibs are seen in the VATER association; however, distinguishing these cases from the VATER association are the findings of pterygia, meningomyelocele, and probable autosomal recessive inheritance. We propose the acronym PHAVER syndrome for limb pterygia, heart defects, autosomal recessive inheritance, vertebral defects, ear anomalies and radial defects. This represents a new autosomal recessive disorder with phenotypic variability.\n",
      "FKBP14-related Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is an extremely rare recessive connective tissue disorder described for the first time in 2012 by Baumann and coworkers. The causal gene, FKBP14, encodes a member of the F506-binding family of peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases. The paucity of patients described so far makes this disorder poorly defined at clinical level. Here, we report an additional pediatric patient, who is compound heterozygous for a recurrent and a novel FKBP14 mutation, and compare his phenotype with those available in literature. This evaluation confirms that kyphoscoliosis (either progressive or non-progressive), myopathy, joint hypermobility, and congenital hearing loss (sensorineural, conductive, or mixed) are the typical features of the syndrome. Since the patient showed a severe cardiovascular event in childhood and atlantoaxial instability, this report expands the phenotype of the disorder and the allelic repertoire of FKBP14. √Ç¬© 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\n",
      "Methylmalonyl-coA epimerase (MCE) follows propionyl-coA carboxylase and precedes methylmalonyl-coA mutase in the pathway converting propionyl-coA to succinyl-coA. MCE deficiency has previously been described in six patients, one presenting with metabolic acidosis, the others with nonspecific neurological symptoms or asymptomatic. The clinical significance and biochemical characteristics of this rare condition have been incompletely defined. We now describe a patient who presented acutely at 5¬†years of age with vomiting, dehydration, confusion, severe metabolic acidosis and mild hyperammonemia. At presentation, organic acid profiles were dominated by increased ketones and 3-hydroxypropionate, with moderately elevated methylcitrate and propionylglycine, and acylcarnitine profiles showed marked C3 (propionylcarnitine) elevation with normal C4DC (methylmalonylcarnitine¬†+¬†succinylcarnitine). Propionic acidemia was initially suspected, but it was subsequently noted that methylmalonic acid was mildly but persistently elevated in urine, and clearly elevated in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. The overall biochemical profile prompted consideration of MCE deficiency. Studies on cultured fibroblasts showed moderately decreased propionate incorporation. Complementation analysis permitted assignment to the MCEE group. A heterozygous p.Arg47Ter (p.R47*) mutation in the MCEE gene was identified by sequencing of exons, and RNA studies identified a novel intronic splicing mutation, c.379-644A¬†>¬†G, confirming the diagnosis of MCE deficiency. Following the initial severe presentation, development has been normal and the clinical course over the subsequent six years has remained relatively uneventful on an essentially normal diet. This report contributes to the clinical and biochemical characterisation of this rare disorder, while highlighting potential causes of under-diagnosis or of diagnostic confusion.\n",
      "Abnormalities in metabolite profiles are valuable indicators of underlying pathologic conditions at the molecular level. However, their interpretation relies on detailed knowledge of the pathways, enzymes, and genes involved. Identification and characterization of their physiological function are therefore crucial for our understanding of human disease: they can provide guidance for therapeutic intervention and help us to identify suitable biomarkers for monitoring associated disorders. We studied two individuals with 2-aminoadipic and 2-oxoadipic aciduria, a metabolic condition that is still unresolved at the molecular level. This disorder has been associated with varying neurological symptoms. Exome sequencing of a single affected individual revealed compound heterozygosity for an initiating methionine mutation (c.1A>G) and a missense mutation (c.2185G>A [p.Gly729Arg]) in DHTKD1. This gene codes for dehydrogenase E1 and transketolase domain-containing protein 1, which is part of a 2-oxoglutarate-dehydrogenase-complex-like protein. Sequence analysis of a second individual identified the same missense mutation together with a nonsense mutation (c.1228C>T [p.Arg410(‚àó)]) in DHTKD1. Increased levels of 2-oxoadipate in individual-derived fibroblasts normalized upon lentiviral expression of the wild-type DHTKD1 mRNA. Moreover, investigation of L-lysine metabolism showed an accumulation of deuterium-labeled 2-oxoadipate only in noncomplemented cells, demonstrating that DHTKD1 codes for the enzyme mediating the last unresolved step in the L-lysine-degradation pathway. All together, our results establish mutations in DHTKD1 as a cause of human 2-aminoadipic and 2-oxoadipic aciduria via impaired turnover of decarboxylation 2-oxoadipate to glutaryl-CoA.\n",
      "A family is reported, several members of which had congenital scalp defects and postaxial polydactyly type A, with wide variability of expression. The hypothesis is formulated that this association is not fortuitous, but is a distinct malformation complex in which congenital scalp defects are associated with distinct malformation of the limbs.\n",
      "This study describes distal symphalangism in 36 individuals in two families, one of which is the largest pedigree of this rare defect yet documented. Distal symphalangism is ankylosis or rigidity of the distal interphalangeal joints of the hands and/or feet. The findings of this report substantiate the mutation as an autosomal dominant phenotype. Several manifestations of distal symphalangism were observed, including the lack of cutaneous creases over affected joints, brachydactyly, fourth-finger hypophalangism, absent nails, and rudimentary nails. Variability ranged from just toes affected, to a single finger affected, to all fingers and all lesser toes affected. The most common expression of the mutant gene was rigid index fingers. Craniosynostosis, premature closure of the sutures of the skull, was encountered twice in the larger of the two families. It is a possible pleiotropic effect of distal symphalangism.\n",
      "A number of heritable immune dysregulatory diseases result from defects affecting regulatory T (Treg) cell development, function, or both. They include immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked (IPEX) syndrome, which is caused by mutations in forkhead box P3 (FOXP3), and IPEX-like disorders caused by mutations in IL-2 receptor Œ± (IL2RA), signal transducer and activator of transcription 5b (STAT5b), and signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1). However, the genetic defects underlying many cases of IPEX-like disorders remain unknown.We sought to identify the genetic abnormalities in patients with idiopathic IPEX-like disorders.We performed whole-exome and targeted gene sequencing and phenotypic and functional analyses of Treg cells.A child who presented with an IPEX-like syndrome and severe Treg cell deficiency was found to harbor a nonsense mutation in the gene encoding LPS-responsive beige-like anchor (LRBA), which was previously implicated as a cause of common variable immunodeficiency with autoimmunity. Analysis of subjects with LRBA deficiency revealed marked Treg cell depletion; profoundly decreased expression of canonical Treg cell markers, including FOXP3, CD25, Helios, and cytotoxic T¬†lymphocyte-associated antigen 4; and impaired Treg cell-mediated suppression. There was skewing in favor of memory T¬†cells and intense autoantibody production, with marked expansion of T follicular helper and contraction of T follicular regulatory cells. Whereas the frequency of recent thymic emigrants and the differentiation of induced Treg cells were normal, LRBA-deficient T cells exhibited increased apoptosis and reduced activities of the metabolic sensors mammalian target of rapamycin complexes 1 and 2.LRBA deficiency is a novel cause of IPEX-like syndrome and Treg cell deficiency associated with metabolic dysfunction and increased apoptosis of Treg cells.\n",
      "The authors report four unrelated girls presenting mild mental deficiency and a distinct malformation syndrome, mainly consisting of short stature, macrocranium, peculiar facies with prominent forehead, hypertelorism and exophthalmos, cardiac anomalies and cutis laxa with characteristic wrinkled palms and soles, typical ribs, small vertebral bodies and slender long bones. All were sporadic cases of non-consanguineous parents of advanced age at their births, suggesting a de novo autosomal dominant mutation.\n",
      "Copy number variants represent an important cause of neurodevelopmental disorders including epilepsy, which is genetically determined in 40% of cases. Epilepsy is caused by chromosomal imbalances or mutations in genes encoding subunits of neuronal voltage- or ligand-gated ion channels or proteins related to neuronal maturation and migration during embryonic development. Here, we report on a girl with mild intellectual disability and idiopathic partial epilepsy. Array-CGH analysis showed a 1.040√Ç¬†Mb de novo interstitial deletion at 9q21.13 band encompassing only four genes, namely RORB, TRPM6, NMRK1, OSTF1, two open reading frames (C9orf40, C9orf41), and a microRNA (MIR548H3). RORB encodes a nuclear receptor highly expressed in the retina, cortex, and thalamus. We hypothesize its role in producing the phenotype of our patient and compare this case with other ones previously reported in the literature to better identify a genotype-phenotype correlation.\n",
      "Familial chylomicronemia syndrome is a group of rare genetic disorders characterized by deficient activity of an enzyme lipoprotein lipase or apo-protein C-II deficiency.

      "Members of the evolutionarily conserved T-box family of transcription factors are important players in developmental processes that include mesoderm formation and patterning and organogenesis both in vertebrates and invertebrates. The importance of T-box genes for human development is illustrated by the association between mutations in several of the 17 human family members and congenital errors of morphogenesis that include cardiac, craniofacial, and limb malformations. We identified two unrelated individuals with a complex cranial, cervical, auricular, and skeletal malformation syndrome with scapular and pelvic hypoplasia (Cousin syndrome) that recapitulates the dysmorphic phenotype seen in the Tbx15-deficient mice, droopy ear. Both affected individuals were homozygous for genomic TBX15 mutations that resulted in truncation of the protein and addition of a stretch of missense amino acids. Although the mutant proteins had an intact T-box and were able to bind to their target DNA sequence in vitro, the missense amino acid sequence directed them to early degradation, and cellular levels were markedly reduced. We conclude that Cousin syndrome is caused by TBX15 insufficiency and is thus the human counterpart of the droopy ear mouse.\n",
      "Two sisters had developmental retardation and congenital hepatic fibrosis. One, 23 years old, had facial anomalies reminiscent of Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome, ocular coloboma, and hypoplastic kidneys with a single cyst. The other sister died at 18 months and had an encephalocele and cystically dilated collecting ducts in the renal medulla. Although the manifestations in these two sisters are similar to the Smith-Lemli-Opitz and Meckel syndromes respectively, there are sufficient differences to suggest that they had a separate autosomal recessive MCA-MR syndrome.\n",
      "We report two new patients with the Patterson-Lowry rhizomelic dysplasia characterized by very short humeri, coxa vara with proximal femoral epiphyseal involvement, short metacarpals, metatarsals and phalanges. The expression of clinical and radiological characteristics is significantly variable, but the unique proximal metaepiphyseal appearance of humeri makes the syndrome easily identifiable. All the reported patients are sporadic. The genetics of the syndrome remain unclear for the moment.\n",
      "Two cases of aphalangy, hemivertebrae, and urogenital-intestinal dysgenesis in a sibship are described. This constellation of malformations may represent a previously undescribed autosomal recessive trait.\n",
      "A unique variety of brachydactyly associated with skeletal and joint anomalies and possible cardiac conduction defects has been observed in three generations of one family in a pattern consistent with autosomal-dominant transmission.

      "Severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) is characterized by low numbers of peripheral neutrophil granulocytes and a predisposition to life-threatening bacterial infections. We describe a novel genetic SCN type in 2 unrelated families associated with recessively inherited loss-of-function mutations in CSF3R, encoding the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) receptor. Family A, with 3 affected children, carried a homozygous missense mutation (NM_000760.3:c.922C>T, NP_000751.1:p.Arg308Cys), which resulted in perturbed N-glycosylation and aberrant localization to the cell surface. Family B, with 1 affected infant, carried compound heterozygous deletions provoking frameshifts and premature stop codons (NM_000760.3:c.948_963del, NP_000751.1:p.Gly316fsTer322 and NM_000760.3:c.1245del, NP_000751.1:p.Gly415fsTer432). Despite peripheral SCN, all patients had morphologic evidence of full myeloid cell maturation in bone marrow. None of the patients responded to treatment with recombinant human G-CSF. Our study highlights the genetic and morphologic SCN variability and provides evidence both for functional importance and redundancy of G-CSF receptor-mediated signaling in human granulopoiesis.\n",
      "Beta-propeller protein-associated neurodegeneration (BPAN) is a rare disorder, which is increasingly recognized thanks to next-generation sequencing. Due to a highly variable phenotype, patients may present to pediatrics, neurology, psychiatry, or internal medicine. It is therefore essential that physicians of different specialties are familiar with this severe and debilitating condition.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE:To investigate whether two forms of the scapuloperoneal syndrome result from genetic defects allelic to facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD). DESIGN:Two kindreds with scapuloperoneal syndromes underwent clinical, histologic, and electrophysiologic evaluation followed by genetic evaluation with probes closely linked to FSHD. RESULTS:Although the proband in each kindred had facial, scapular stabilizer, and humeral weakness, raising the possibility of FSHD, evaluation of multiple other affected family members showed patterns of involvement that were clinically distinct from typical FSHD. In addition, DNA studies showed no linkage to the 4q35 FSHD locus in either kindred. CONCLUSION:We conclude that these two forms of the scapuloperoneal syndrome are genetically distinct from FSHD.\n",
      "The review presents a clinical case of 40 years old female patient with bilateral recurrent corneal erosions (r.c.e.), without an obvious cause. It is relevant to mention the present of the r.c.e. in her family during 4 generations. The acute corneal lesions looked like a \"map-dot-fingerprint\" dystrophy and 3 weeks later cornea became normal.\n",
      "Dyssegmental dysplasia, Silverman-Handmaker type (DDSH; #MIM 224410) is an autosomal recessive form of lethal dwarfism characterized by a defect in segmentation and fusion of vertebral bodies components (\"anisospondyly\") and by severe limb shortening. It is caused by mutations in the perlecan gene (HSPG2), but so far, only three molecularly confirmed cases have been reported. We report a novel case of DDSH in a fetus that presented at 15 weeks gestation with encephalocele, severe micromelic dwarfism and narrow thorax. After termination of pregnancy, radiographs showed short ribs, short and bent long bones and anisospondyly of two vertebral bodies. The fetus was homozygous for a previously undescribed null mutation in HSPG2.\n",
      "We report two sibs with an undescribed MCA/MR syndrome. Both had a 46,XY chromosome constitution. The first patient is profoundly mentally retarded. Clinical features include short stature, coarse face, deep set eyes, microphthalmia, large ears, gynecoid obesity, imperforate anus, sacral spina bifida, pseudovaginal perineoscrotal hypospadias, persistence of M√ºllerian structures, and low gonadotrophin levels. His XY sib was raised as a girl. She was slightly mentally impaired. She had microphthalmia and large ears, and was short. A complete uterus with tubae and a single intraabdominal gonad with testicular organization were removed during infancy. Those anomalies do not fit any previously reported syndrome, although the general aspect of the propositus clearly resembles Borjeson-Forssman-Lehmann syndrome. Inheritance could be either autosomal recessive or X-linked.\n",
      "The Lamin B receptor (LBR) gene has been described to encode a bifunctional protein. Mutations in the LBR gene can affect neutrophil segmentation and sterol reductase activity and have been associated with two different recognized clinical conditions, Pelger-Huet anomaly (PHA) and Greenberg skeletal dysplasia. PHA is a benign autosomal co-dominant laminopathy resulting in bilobed neutrophil nuclei in heterozygotes, and unsegmented (ovoid) neutrophil nuclei in homozygotes. Some putative PHA homozygotes have been reported with minor skeletal malformations. Greenberg skeletal dysplasia is a severe autosomal recessive, perinatal lethal dwarfing disorder in which heterozygous carriers are usually without clinical manifestations. We here report a girl who has bilobed neutrophil nuclei and a mild skeletal dysplasia. Mutation analysis showed two novel mutations in the LBR gene: c.651_653 delinsTGATGAGAAA (p.Ile218Aspfs*19) and c.1757G‚Äâ>‚ÄâA (p.Arg586His). These mutations were found to be in trans, and, thus, she is a compound heterozygote. Sterol analysis found trace amounts of cholesta-8,14-dien-3beta-ol, which is normally undetected in healthy individuals. This and previously reported cases suggest that mutations in LBR can result in a continuum of phenotypic manifestations.\n",
      "A brother and sister from the island of Rodrigues had mental retardation, blindness owing to severe ocular malformations, short stature, dysmorphic facial features, hypotrichosis, and dental abnormalities. It is likely that they have a hitherto unrecognised autosomal recessive ectodermal dysplasia syndrome.\n",
      "Composite hemangioendothelioma (HE) is a rare vascular neoplasm of intermediate malignant potential that predominantly occurs within the dermis or subcutis of the extremities, and occurs in a wide age range. It is locally aggressive with a high rate of local recurrence, and more rarely regional lymph node or distant metastasis. Histologically, it is composed of a complex admixture of benign, intermediate and malignant vascular components. Although composite HE may contain angiosarcoma-like areas, its prognosis is better than that of pure angiosarcoma. We describe a case of composite HE presenting as a submandibular mass in a 43√Ç¬†year-old male, which included areas of prominent 'high grade' epithelioid angiosarcoma. This adds to the range of anatomic sites of these neoplasms, highlights the importance of recognition of the head and neck as a potential site, and emphasizes the importance of accurate diagnosis for correct management (including of long term follow up) and prognostication.\n",
      "Osteopathia striata and a macular, hyperpigmented dermopathy were found in a Caucasian woman and her two daughters. Sequential radiographs in one daughter showed that the bone lesions were not present during infancy but developed during early childhood. The skin lesions were not those most often associated with osteopathia striata, but appeared tgo be a unique dermatosis, which also included a hypopigmented forelock. A son had neither osseous nor ectodermal lesions. These abnormalities appear to represent a new syndrome, which is inherited with X-linked or autosomal dominant transmission.\n",
      "A patient is described with trisomy 1 mosaicism which was discovered on 24-h culture of a neonatal blood sample, but was not detectable on subsequent 48- and 72-h cultures.

      "Cytochrome P450 side-chain cleavage enzyme (CYP11A1) facilitates the first and rate-limiting step of steroidogenesis. Only nine patients with CYP11A1 deficiency have been described. All patients presented with adrenal insufficiency (AI) and disorder of sex development in 46,XY individuals.Our objective was to define the pathogenic consequences of a novel CYP11A1 mutation (p.R451W) found in two brothers with isolated adrenal insufficiency.The two brothers (46,XY) presented with AI and normal male genital development. The older boy first presented with signs and symptoms suggestive of AI at the age of 2.8 yr but was only diagnosed at the age of 4.1 yr during an adrenal crisis. The younger brother was diagnosed with AI at the age of 2.5 yr while being clinically asymptomatic. Both boys had entirely normal appearance of their external genitalia.The novel p.R451W mutation and five published missense CYP11A1 mutations were characterized employing two in vitro approaches using the natural substrate cholesterol and the intermediate 22R-hydroxycholesterol, respectively. Pregnenolone generation was measured by highly specific liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. p.R451W had 30% of wild-type activity consistent with the clinical phenotype in our patients. Two previously published mutations (p.L222P and p.A359V) had 2- to 3-fold higher in vitro activities than originally reported, correlating better with the associated phenotypes.We provide the first evidence that partial CYP11A1 deficiency has to be considered as a differential diagnosis in clinically isolated adrenal insufficiency. Our assays demonstrate a tighter genotype-phenotype correlation in CYP11A1 deficiency than previous in vitro studies.\n",
      "Two siblings from consanguineous parents died perinatally with a condition characterized by generalized hypotonia, respiratory insufficiency, arthrogryposis, microcephaly, congenital brain malformations and hyperglycinemia. Catalytic activities of the mitochondrial respiratory complexes I and II were deficient in skeletal muscle, a finding suggestive of an inborn error in mitochondrial biogenesis. Homozygosity mapping identified IBA57 located in the largest homozygous region on chromosome 1 as a culprit candidate gene. IBA57 is known to be involved in the biosynthesis of mitochondrial [4Fe-4S] proteins. Sequence analysis of IBA57 revealed the homozygous mutation c.941A > C, p.Gln314Pro. Severely decreased amounts of IBA57 protein were observed in skeletal muscle and cultured skin fibroblasts from the affected subjects. HeLa cells depleted of IBA57 showed biochemical defects resembling the ones found in patient-derived cells, including a decrease in various mitochondrial [4Fe-4S] proteins and in proteins covalently linked to lipoic acid (LA), a cofactor produced by the [4Fe-4S] protein LA synthase. The defects could be complemented by wild-type IBA57 and partially by mutant IBA57. As a result of the mutation, IBA57 protein was excessively degraded, an effect ameliorated by protease inhibitors. Hence, we propose that the mutation leads to partial functional impairment of IBA57, yet the major pathogenic impact is due to its proteolytic degradation below physiologically critical levels. In conclusion, the ensuing lethal complex biochemical phenotype of a novel metabolic syndrome results from multiple Fe/S protein defects caused by a deficiency in the Fe/S cluster assembly protein IBA57.\n",
      "Mitochondrial fission and fusion are dynamic processes vital to mitochondrial quality control and the maintenance of cellular respiration. In dividing mitochondria, membrane scission is accomplished by a dynamin-related GTPase, DNM1L, that oligomerizes at the site of fission and constricts in a GTP-dependent manner. There is only a single previous report of DNM1L-related clinical disease: a female neonate with encephalopathy due to defective mitochondrial and peroxisomal fission (EMPF; OMIM #614388), a lethal disorder characterized by cerebral dysgenesis, seizures, lactic acidosis, elevated very long chain fatty acids, and abnormally elongated mitochondria and peroxisomes. Here, we describe a second individual, diagnosed via whole-exome sequencing, who presented with developmental delay, refractory epilepsy, prolonged survival, and no evidence of mitochondrial or peroxisomal dysfunction on standard screening investigations in blood and urine. EEG was nonspecific, showing background slowing with frequent epileptiform activity at the frontal and central head regions. Electron microscopy of skeletal muscle showed subtle, nonspecific abnormalities of cristal organization, and confocal microscopy of patient fibroblasts showed striking hyperfusion of the mitochondrial network. A panel of further bioenergetic studies in patient fibroblasts showed no significant differences versus controls. The proband's de novo DNM1L variant, NM_012062.4:c.1085G>A; NP_036192.2:p.(Gly362Asp), falls within the middle (oligomerization) domain of DNM1L, implying a likely dominant-negative mechanism. This disorder, which presents nonspecifically and affords few diagnostic clues, can be diagnosed by means of DNM1L sequencing and/or confocal microscopy.\n",
      "Cowchock syndrome (CMTX4) is a slowly progressive X-linked recessive disorder with axonal neuropathy, deafness, and cognitive impairment. The disease locus was previously mapped to an 11 cM region at chromosome X: q24-q26. Exome sequencing of an affected individual from the originally described family identified a missense change c.1478A>T (p.Glu493Val) in AIFM1, the gene encoding apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) mitochondrion-associated 1. The change is at a highly conserved residue and cosegregated with the phenotype in the family. AIF is an FAD-dependent NADH oxidase that is imported into mitochondria. With apoptotic insults, a N-terminal transmembrane linker is cleaved off, producing a soluble fragment that is released into the cytosol and then transported into the nucleus, where it triggers caspase-independent apoptosis. Another AIFM1 mutation that predicts p.Arg201del has recently been associated with severe mitochondrial encephalomyopathy in two infants by impairing oxidative phosphorylation. The c.1478A>T (p.Glu493Val) mutation found in the family reported here alters the redox properties of the AIF protein and results in increased cell death via apoptosis, without affecting the activity of the respiratory chain complexes. Our findings expand the spectrum of AIF-related disease and provide insight into the effects of AIFM1 mutations.\n",
      "We report on a male with brachydactyly, thin habitus with narrow shoulders, mesomelic shortness of the arms, long lower face with obtuse mandibular angle, maxillary hypoplasia with beaking of the nose, aortic root dilatation, and mitral valve prolapse. This combination of findings has not been reported previously.\n",
      "Multiple-respiratory-chain deficiency represents an important cause of mitochondrial disorders. Hitherto, however, mutations in genes involved in mtDNA maintenance and translation machinery only account for a fraction of cases. Exome sequencing in two siblings, born to consanguineous parents, with severe encephalomyopathy, choreoathetotic movements, and combined respiratory-chain defects allowed us to identify a homozygous PNPT1 missense mutation (c.1160A>G) that encodes the mitochondrial polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase). Blue-native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that no PNPase complex could be detected in subject fibroblasts, confirming that the substitution encoded by c.1160A>G disrupts the trimerization of the protein. PNPase is predominantly localized in the mitochondrial intermembrane space and is implicated in RNA targeting to human mitochondria. Mammalian mitochondria import several small noncoding nuclear RNAs (5S rRNA, MRP RNA, some tRNAs, and miRNAs). By RNA hybridization experiments, we observed a significant decrease in 5S rRNA and MRP-related RNA import into mitochondria in fibroblasts of affected subject 1. Moreover, we found a reproducible decrease in the rate of mitochondrial translation in her fibroblasts. Finally, overexpression of the wild-type PNPT1 cDNA in fibroblasts of subject 1 induced an increase in 5S rRNA import in mitochondria and rescued the¬†mitochondrial-translation deficiency. In conclusion, we report here abnormal RNA import into mitochondria as a cause of respiratory-chain deficiency.\n",
      "An 8-year-old girl presented with a papillomatous lower eyelid lesion, which had been present since infancy. An incisional biopsy diagnosed syringocystadenoma papilliferum. The origin and natural history of syringocystadenoma papilliferum remain disputed and are reviewed. In view of its association with basal cell carcinoma, further management options are discussed.\n",
      "A homozygous loss-of-function mutation p.(Arg316Gln) in the fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) gene, which encodes for an iron and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenase, was previously identified in a large family in which nine affected individuals present with a lethal syndrome characterised by growth retardation and multiple malformations. To date, no other pathogenic mutation in FTO has been identified as a cause of multiple congenital malformations.We investigated a 21-month-old girl who presented distinctive facial features, failure to thrive, global developmental delay, left ventricular cardiac hypertrophy, reduced vision and bilateral hearing loss. We performed targeted next-generation sequencing of 4813 clinically relevant genes in the patient and her parents.We identified a novel FTO homozygous missense mutation (c.956C>T; p.(Ser319Phe)) in the affected individual. This mutation affects a highly conserved residue located in the same functional domain as the previously characterised mutation p.(Arg316Gln). Biochemical studies reveal that p.(Ser319Phe) FTO has reduced 2-oxoglutarate turnover and N-methyl-nucleoside demethylase activity.Our findings are consistent with previous reports that homozygous mutations in FTO can lead to rare growth retardation and developmental delay syndrome, and further support the proposal that FTO plays an important role in early development of human central nervous and cardiovascular systems.\n",
      "3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency is a disorder of steroid biosynthesis resulting in decreased production of all 3 groups of adrenal steroids. The symptomatology includes congenital adrenal hyperplasia disorders and ambiguous genitalia in 46, XY males. 3beta-HSD deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder. Much heterogeneity exists in the clinical presentation of this disorder.\n",
      "Alterations of sphingolipid metabolism are implicated in the pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative disorders.We identified a homozygous nonsynonymous mutation in CERS1, the gene encoding ceramide synthase 1, in 4 siblings affected by a progressive disorder with myoclonic epilepsy and dementia. CerS1, a transmembrane protein of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), catalyzes the biosynthesis of C18-ceramides.We demonstrated that the mutation decreases C18-ceramide levels. In addition, we showed that downregulation of CerS1 in a neuroblastoma cell line triggers ER stress response and induces proapoptotic pathways.This study demonstrates that impairment of ceramide biosynthesis underlies neurodegeneration in humans.\n",
      "Mutations in the type XI collagen alpha-1 chain gene (COL11A1) cause a change in protein structure that alters its interactions with collagens II and V, resulting in abnormalities in cartilage and ocular vitreous. The most common type XI collagenopathies are dominantly inherited Stickler or Marshall syndromes, while severe recessive skeletal dysplasias, such as fibrochondrogenesis, occur less frequently. We describe a family with a severe skeletal dysplasia caused by a novel dominantly inherited COL11A1 mutation. The siblings each presented with severe myopia, hearing loss, micromelia, metaphyseal widening of the long bones, micrognathia, and airway compromise requiring tracheostomy. The first child lived for over 2 years, while the second succumbed at 5 months of age. Their mother has mild rhizomelic shortening of the limbs, brachydactyly, and severe myopia. Sequencing of COL11A1 revealed a novel deleterious heterozygous mutation in COL11A1 involving the triple helical domain in both siblings, and a mosaic mutation in their mother, indicating germline mosaicism with subsequent dominant inheritance. These are the first reported individuals with a dominantly inherited mutation in COL11A1 associated with a severe skeletal dysplasia. The skeletal involvement is similar to, yet milder than fibrochondrogenesis and allowed for survival beyond the perinatal period. These cases highlight both a novel dominant COL11A1 mutation causing a significant skeletal dysplasia and the phenotypic heterogeneity of collagenopathies.\n",
      "A consanguineous Bedouin Israeli kindred presented with a novel autosomal recessive intellectual disability syndrome of congenital microcephaly, low anterior hairline, bitemporal narrowing, low-set protruding ears, strabismus and tented thick eyebrows with sparse hair in their medial segment. Brain imaging demonstrated various degrees of agenesis of corpus callosum and hypoplasia of the vermis and cerebellum. Genome-wide linkage analysis followed by fine mapping defined a 7.67‚ÄâMb disease-associated locus (LOD score 4.99 at Œ∏=0 for marker D10S1653). Sequencing of the 48 genes within the locus identified a single non-synonymous homozygous duplication frameshift mutation of 13 nucleotides (c.2134_2146dup13) within the coding region of FRMD4A, that was common to all affected individuals and not found in 180 non-related Bedouin controls. Three of 50 remotely related healthy controls of the same tribe were heterozygous for the mutation. FRMD4A, member of the FERM superfamily, is involved in cell structure, transport and signaling. It regulates cell polarity by playing an important role in the activation of ARF6, mediating the interaction between Par3 and the ARF6 guanine nucleotide exchange factor. ARF6 is known to modulate cell polarity in neurons, and regulates dendritic branching in hippocampal neurons and neurite outgrowth. The FRMD4 domain that is essential for determining cell polarity through interaction with Par3 is truncated by the c.2134_2146dup13 mutation. FRMD4A polymorphisms were recently suggested to be a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. We now show a homozygous frameshift mutation of the same gene in a severe neurologic syndrome with unique dysmorphism.\n",
      "A consanguineous Pakistani family is described in which family members developed renal failure without haematuria, parathyroid hyperplasia, and sensorineural deafness. We believe the condition to be inherited as an autosomal recessive and to be distinct from Alport's syndrome, which is an X linked condition usually associated with haematuria.\n",
      "RPL10 encodes ribosomal protein L10 (uL16), a highly conserved multifunctional component of the large ribosomal subunit, involved in ribosome biogenesis and function. Using X-exome resequencing, we identified a novel missense mutation (c.191C>T; p.(A64V)) in the N-terminal domain of the protein, in a family with two affected cousins presenting with X-linked intellectual disability, cerebellar hypoplasia, and spondylo-epiphyseal dysplasia (SED). We assessed the impact of the mutation on the translational capacity of the cell using yeast as model system. The mutation generates a functional ribosomal protein, able to complement the translational defects of a conditional lethal mutation of yeast rpl10. However, unlike previously reported mutations, this novel RPL10 missense mutation results in an increase in the actively translating ribosome population. Our results expand the mutational and clinical spectrum of RPL10 identifying a new genetic cause of SED and highlight the emerging role of ribosomal proteins in the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders.\n",
      "BACKGROUND:Hereditary forms of hearing loss are classified as syndromic, when deafness is associated with other clinical features, or non-syndromic, when deafness occurs without other clinical features. Many types of syndromic deafness have been described, some of which have been mapped to specific chromosomal regions. METHODS:Here we describe a family with progressive sensorineural hearing loss, cognitive impairment, facial dysmorphism, and variable other features, transmitted by apparent X linked recessive inheritance. Haplotype analysis of PCR products spanning the X chromosome and direct sequencing of candidate genes were used to begin characterising the molecular basis of features transmitted in this family. Comparison to known syndromes involving deafness, mental retardation, facial dysmorphism, and other clinical features was performed by review of published reports and personal discussions. RESULTS:Genetic mapping places the candidate locus for this syndrome within a 48 cM region on Xq1-21. Candidate genes including COL4A5, DIAPH, and POU3F4 were excluded by clinical and molecular analyses. CONCLUSIONS:The constellation of clinical findings in this family (deafness, cognitive impairment, facial dysmorphism, variable renal and genitourinary abnormalities, and late onset pancytopenia), along with a shared haplotype on Xq1-21, suggests that this represents a new form of syndromic deafness. We discuss our findings in comparison to several other syndromic and non-syndromic deafness loci that have been mapped to the X chromosome.\n",
      "A syndrome with severe generalized congenital ichthyosis, alopecia, eclabion, ectropion and mental retardation without neurological symptoms or macular changes in the eyes was seen in two sibs and in two aunts and uncles in an inbred North-Swedish family. The clinical picture of the patients in the present family strongly deviated from that seen in the Sj√É¬∂gren-Larsson syndrome found in the same area. This could be a new syndrome with autosomal recessive inheritance.\n",
      "Mental retardation, epilepsy, palpebral conjunctival telangiectasias and diminished serum IgA, with a particular facies and shortened fifth finger were found in a 12-year-old Mexican girl. She has six siblings, of whom five have the same characteristics. The parents and the elder sister were not affected, and there was no history of consanguinity. This seems to be a new syndrome, and as both sexes are affected, the parents are normal and several siblings have the same syndrome, we postulate an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance.\n",
      "Infantile digital fibromatosis (IDF) is a rare tumour of infancy with a typical clinical presentation and characteristic histopathological findings. Despite an alarming appearance, IDF does not cause deep infiltration or metastasis. The traditional approach of surgical resection was recently challenged by increasing evidence of self regression in months or years. We describe the clinical history of five patients with IDF that were followed in our departments for 5 years.\n",
      "Deficiencies in respiratory-chain complexes lead to a variety of clinical phenotypes resulting from inadequate energy production by the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation system. Defective expression of mtDNA-encoded genes, caused by mutations in either the mitochondrial or nuclear genome, represents a rapidly growing group of human disorders. By whole-exome sequencing, we identified two unrelated individuals carrying compound heterozygous variants in TRMT5 (tRNA methyltransferase 5). TRMT5 encodes a mitochondrial protein with strong homology to members of the class I-like methyltransferase superfamily. Both affected individuals presented with lactic acidosis and evidence of multiple mitochondrial respiratory-chain-complex deficiencies in skeletal muscle, although the clinical presentation of the two affected subjects was remarkably different; one presented in childhood with failure to thrive and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and the other was an adult with a life-long history of exercise intolerance. Mutations in TRMT5 were associated with the hypomodification of a guanosine residue at position 37 (G37) of mitochondrial tRNA; this hypomodification was particularly prominent in skeletal muscle. Deficiency of the G37 modification was also detected in human cells subjected to TRMT5 RNAi. The pathogenicity of the detected variants was further confirmed in a heterologous yeast model and by the rescue of the molecular phenotype after re-expression of wild-type TRMT5 cDNA in cells derived from the affected individuals. Our study highlights the importance of post-transcriptional modification of mitochondrial tRNAs for faithful mitochondrial function.\n",
      "Posterior amorphous corneal dystrophy (PACD) is a rare autosomal-dominant disease, generally classified with the pre-Descemet's dystrophies. It is characterized by deep stromal corneal opacification, flat corneas with low keratometry values, and central thinning. To our knowledge, only one previous ultrastructural study has been published on this disease. This 5-year-old white boy presented with best corrected vision (20/50 right and 20/60 -2 left). The corneas had dense opacities, bilaterally, deep in the corneal stroma. Keratometry was 39.50/40.50, bilaterally. The patient's father had 20/20 vision, bilaterally, with minimal opacifications in the deep corneal stroma. A penetrating keratoplasty was performed. In contrast to the previously reported case of PACD, in which the abnormalities were largely limited to the stroma, our patient had subepithelial deposits, only mild stromal abnormalities, and a thick collagenous layer posterior to Descemet's membrane, thus suggesting that this variant of PACD is a generalized corneal disease including endothelial and epithelial abnormalities, rather than a pure stromal dystrophy.\n",
      "A 2 year-and seven month-old male boy with vascular malformation and localized soft tissue hypotrophy is reported. Such presentation could represent the mildest end of the spectrum of 'inverse' Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome, a recently proposed disorder presenting with tissue hypotrophy as opposed to partial or complete limb overgrowth of classic Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome.\n",
      "PURPOSE:To study the platelets from a family with a new form of inherited giant platelet disorder. PATIENTS AND METHODS:Two siblings exhibited a hemorrhagic disorder characterized by moderate thrombocytopenia, giant platelets, and markedly prolonged bleeding time. The parents had no discernible platelet defect. Both children also developed mitral regurgitation requiring medication, and one underwent surgical replacement at the age of 3 years. RESULTS:The mean platelet size was greater than 20 microm3. Direct measurements of the two major axes of each of 12 platelets on electron micrographs revealed a range of 2x4 to 4x6 microm. Electron microscopy did not demonstrate any abnormality of granule content. The platelets agglutinated normally with ristocetin and aggregated normally with collagen. However, the aggregation was slightly slower than normal with ADP, epinephrine, and Na arachidonate. Two-dimensional unreduced versus reduced SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of surface radioiodinated platelet glycoproteins revealed absence of proteins Ia, Ic, and IIa in both affected children, whereas GP Ib, IIb, and IIIa appeared normal. The 2D gels of platelet glycoproteins from both parents were identical to controls. Western blots demonstrated that GP Ic, Ic', Ib, and Ia/IIa were present. CONCLUSIONS:This disorder represents a new syndrome of thrombocytopenia with giant platelets distinct from Bernard-Soulier, Montreal giant platelets, Swiss cheese platelets, May-Hegglin anomaly, and other previously described syndromes.\n",
      "Five cases of spastic paraplegia with a progressive symmetrical sensory neuropathy producing ulceration and osteomyelitis of the hands and feet are reported. The pathology in one patient, who died of secondary amyloidosis, was similar to that found by Denny-Brown in hereditary sensory radicular neuropathy with severe loss of posterior root ganglion cells and loss of myelinated fibres in both peripheral nerves and posterior columns of the spinal cord. A sural nerve biopsy in another case showed a striking loss of both myelinated and unmyelinated fibres, with some evidence of degeneration and regeneration. The inheritance is probably by an autosomal recessive gene. The prognosis in the more severe form of the disorder is poor.\n",
      "The oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system is under control of both the mitochondrial and the nuclear genomes; 13 subunits are synthesized by the mitochondrial translation machinery. We report a patient with Cornelia de Lange-like dysmorphic features, brain abnormalities and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and studied the genetic defect responsible for the combined OXPHOS complex I, III and IV deficiency observed in fibroblasts. The combination of deficiencies suggested a primary defect associated with the synthesis of mitochondrially encoded OXPHOS subunits. Analysis of mitochondrial protein synthesis revealed a marked impairment in mitochondrial translation. Homozygosity mapping and sequence analysis of candidate genes revealed a homozygous mutation in MRPS22, a gene encoding a mitochondrial ribosomal small subunit protein. The mutation predicts a Leu215Pro substitution at an evolutionary conserved site. Mutations in genes implicated in Cornelia de Lange syndrome or copy number variations were not found. Transfection of patient fibroblasts, in which MRPS22 was undetectable, with the wild-type MRPS22 cDNA restored the amount and activity of OXPHOS complex IV, as well as the 12S rRNA transcript level to normal values. These findings demonstrate the pathogenicity of the MRPS22 mutation and stress the significance of mutations in nuclear genes, including genes that have no counterparts in lower species like bacteria and yeast, for mitochondrial translation defects.\n",

      "Five children, between 2 and 10 years old, 3 boys and 2 girls, two of them siblings, showed mild clinical and morphological congenital muscular dystrophy. Neuromuscular signs and symptoms being present from birth or early infancy, aggravated only insignificantly during the course of the disease. Three patients developed right ventricular hypertrophy after the age of 9 years, of whom 2 died of cardiac failure at the age of 11 years. There was probably no cardiomyopathy; pulmonary hypertension of unclear range or slightly elevated. The EMG showed abnormal but non-specific features. A myopathic fiber diameter spectrum, intrafascicular fat cells and mild endomysial fibrosis as well as insufficient fiber typing and type I predominance were prominent in histopathological findings. Ultrastructurally, abnormal myofibers were present in each biopsy although the fine structural pathology was non-specific. The families of the patients came from a genetic isolate in the North-Eastern region of the Federal Republic of Germany. The first 4 patients were genetically related to each other by several links among their families dated back over the last 3 centuries. The fifth patient came from the same area, but unequivocal familial linkage could not be established. An autosomal recessive mode of inheritance is suggested for this congenital muscular dystrophy.\n",
      "Odonto-onycho-dermal dysplasia (OODD) is a rare form of ectodermal dysplasia characterized by severe oligodontia, onychodysplasia, palmoplantar hyperkeratosis, dry skin, hypotrichosis, and hyperhidrosis of the palms and soles. The ectodermal dysplasias resulting from biallelic mutations in the WNT10A gene result in highly variable phenotypes, ranging from isolated tooth agenesis to OODD and Sch√∂pf-Schulz-Passarge syndrome (SSPS).We identified a female patient, with consanguineous parents, who was clinically diagnosed with OODD. Genetic testing showed that she was homozygous for a previously reported pathogenic mutation in the WNT10A gene, c.321C‚Äâ>‚ÄâA, p.Cys107*. The skin and nail abnormalities were for many years interpreted as psoriasis and treated accordingly. A thorough clinical examination revealed hypotrichosis and hyperhidrosis of the soles and dental examination revealed agenesis of permanent teeth except the two maxillary central incisors. Skin biopsies from the hyperkeratotic palms and soles showed the characteristic changes of eccrine syringofibroadenomatosis, which has been described in patients with ectodermal dysplasias. Together with a family history of tooth anomalies, this lead to the clinical suspicion of a hereditary ectodermal dysplasia.This case illustrates the challenges of diagnosing ectodermal dysplasia like OODD and highlights the relevance of interdisciplinary cooperation in the diagnosis of rare conditions.\n",
      "We report on a child with a 'new' syndrome characterized by multiple congenital anomalies, mental retardation, sensorineural deafness, talon cusps of upper central incisors, growth retardation, bilateral symmetrical digital anomalies mainly in the form of preaxial brachydactyly and hyperphalangism of digits I-III. Because he had a similarly affected brother and his parents were cousins we suggest autosomal recessive inheritance, X-linked recessive inheritance cannot be excluded. Differential diagnosis from other syndromes with preaxial brachydactyly and hyperphalangism is presented.\n",
      "Three of four offspring of consanguineous parents presented a unique association of microcephaly, mental retardation, spasticity, connective tissue abnormalities, cleft palate, persistent hypertrophic primary vitreous, and short stature. In one patient brain atrophy was documented. All the affected individuals had severe asthma and it is thought that the asthma is associated with the syndrome complex. Genetic transmission is most likely autosomal recessive. We believe this constellation of findings to be a new genetic syndrome and have termed it the oculo-palato-cerebral dwarfism syndrome.\n",
      "PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to characterize the congenital stromal corneal dystrophy (CSCD) pathological and clinical phenotype in a Chinese family with a novel mutation of decorin and its possible molecular pathogenesis. METHODS: Molecular genetic analyses were performed on 5 patients with CSCD. Clinical characteristics, optical coherence tomography, and confocal microscopic study were evaluated. The corneal specimens from patients with CSCD were sent for light and electron microscopic evaluation. A protein modeling study was carried out to assess the effect of the mutation on the protein structure. RESULTS: Sequencing analysis of DCN revealed that all patients with CSCD were heterozygous for a 1-bp deletion at nucleotide 962 (c.962delA) in exon 8. This causes a premature termination of the decorin protein by frameshift, causing the deletion of 33 amino acids in the C-terminal end of the decorin protein. Optical coherence tomography and confocal microscopic study demonstrated that the corneal lamellar structure was disrupted and that this is more severe in the anterior and posterior central stroma. Histopathological study showed that electron-lucent zones were present between the normal-appearing collagen lamellae in the patients with CSCD. Abnormally thinned collagen filaments were identified in the electron-lucent zones, which could be due to abnormal decorin binding to the collagen microfibrils. Protein modeling studies involving wild-type and mutant protein indicated that mutant decorin might be unable to bind to all 4 collagen microfibrils as the normal decorin would. CONCLUSIONS: We present the clinical, histopathological, and molecular genetic assessment of a Chinese family with CSCD in which a novel DCN mutation was identified. Our findings add to the allelic heterogeneity of this rare form of inherited corneal disease.\n",
      "Wolcott-Rallison syndrome (WRS) is a rare autosomal recessive disease, characterized by neonatal/early-onset non-autoimmune insulin-requiring diabetes associated with skeletal dysplasia and growth retardation. Fewer than 60 cases have been described in the literature, although WRS is now recognised as the most frequent cause of neonatal/early-onset diabetes in patients with consanguineous parents. Typically, diabetes occurs before six months of age, and skeletal dysplasia is diagnosed within the first year or two of life. Other manifestations vary between patients in their nature and severity and include frequent episodes of acute liver failure, renal dysfunction, exocrine pancreas insufficiency, intellectual deficit, hypothyroidism, neutropenia and recurrent infections. Bone fractures may be frequent. WRS is caused by mutations in the gene encoding eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2Œ± kinase 3 (EIF2AK3), also known as PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK). PERK is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) transmembrane protein, which plays a key role in translation control during the unfolded protein response. ER dysfunction is central to the disease processes. The disease variability appears to be independent of the nature of the EIF2AK3 mutations, with the possible exception of an older age at onset; other factors may include other genes, exposure to environmental factors and disease management. WRS should be suspected in any infant who presents with permanent neonatal diabetes associated with skeletal dysplasia and/or episodes of acute liver failure. Molecular genetic testing confirms the diagnosis. Early diagnosis is recommended, in order to ensure rapid intervention for episodes of hepatic failure, which is the most life threatening complication. WRS should be differentiated from other forms of neonatal/early-onset insulin-dependent diabetes based on clinical presentation and genetic testing. Genetic counselling and antenatal diagnosis is recommended for parents of a WRS patient with confirmed EIF2AK3 mutation. Close therapeutic monitoring of diabetes and treatment with an insulin pump are recommended because of the risk of acute episodes of hypoglycaemia and ketoacidosis. Interventions under general anaesthesia increase the risk of acute aggravation, because of the toxicity of anaesthetics, and should be avoided. Prognosis is poor and most patients die at a young age. Intervention strategies targeting ER dysfunction provide hope for future therapy and prevention.\n",
      "Ameloblastic carcinoma (AC) is a rare malignant odontogenic neoplasm with scarce reported cases in the literature and it can be confused with benign ameloblastoma (AM). This study reports a case of AC, and presents a literature review of AC classified into primary type (ACPt) or secondary type (ACSt) by the World Health Organization (WHO). The review addressed 31 cases published in the English literature between the years 2005 and 2011. The majority of cases were ACSt. The mandible was the most common site of occurrence for both AC types. All patients who died of their disease had ACSt. Tumors with plexiform pattern, hyperchromatism, mitosis and necrosis were associated with a higher ratio of histories of recurrence and death by disease, as well as the tumors with clear cells, especially in the ACSt. ACSt appeared to correlate with recurrence and mortality. The histological features may have different prognostic importance depending on the AC type.\n",
      "Dysspondyloenchondromatosis (DSC) is a rare skeletal dysplasia characterized by enchondroma-like lesions and anisospondyly. The former leads to discrepancies in limb length, and the latter, to progressive kyphoscoliosis. Two recent cases have highlighted the genetic heterogeneity of DSC, one demonstrating the presence and, the other, the absence of a COL2A1 mutation. This may have important clinical implications, for example, screening for complications including atlanto-axial instability associated with type II collagenopathies, as well as long-term patient management. We report on a case with radiographic features of DSC with overlap into the type II collagenopathy spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia, Strudwick type, who was found to carry a novel heterozygous mutation in the COL2A1 gene. Testing for COL2A1 mutations should be performed in all patients with radiological features of DSC. Further research is needed to identify the underlying molecular cause in cases where no COL2A1 mutation is identified.\n",
      "We report on a new patient with clinical findings consistent with acro-dermato-ungual-lacrimal-tooth (ADULT) syndrome. The child had sparse hair, extensive freckling, lacrimal duct stenosis, oligodontia, dystrophic nails, reduced sweating, and bilateral athelia. Examination of his hands showed ulnar ray hypoplasia with bilateral fifth finger brachydactyly and camptodactyly. He also had surgical repair of an imperforate anus. Mutation analysis of TP63 showed a single nucleotide substitution, c.G518A, predicting a novel missense mutation, p.V114M in exon 4. This is the third mutation to be reported in TP63 in ADULT syndrome.\n",
      "A case of 49, XXXYY chromosome anomaly in an adult male is reported. Features of Klinefelter's syndrome are predominant among the clinical findings. Characteristics suggestive of acromegaly have been associated with this chromosomal anomaly. Despite prognathism and an overhanging brow, acromegaly was not present in this case. Psychological traits sometimes reported in males with the XXY and XYY karyotypes were seen in this patient, but the variability of expression of these characteristics calls into question the validity of their correlation with the presence of supernumerary sex chromosomes.\n",
      "Authors make a report concerning a male patient who presents microcephaly, oculocutaneus albinism, hypoplasia of the distal phalanx of the 1st, 3rd and 4th finger of the right hand, 1st, 3rd, 4th and 5th finger of the left hand and agenesia of the distal end of the big toe of the right foot. They think it is a new dysmorphic syndrome. Because of patient's sister presented a similar picture they suggest that it may be an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern.\n",

      "Congenital neuronal ceroid-lipofuscinosis (NCL) is a devastating inherited neurodegenerative disorder of unknown metabolic basis. Eight patients with this rare disorder, all with similar clinical and neuropathological findings, have been reported, and here we describe two further patients. Previously, we showed that a mutation in the cathepsin D gene causes congenital NCL in sheep. On the basis of the neuropathological and ultrastructural similarities between the sheep and patients affected with congenital NCL, we screened the cathepsin D gene for mutations in a patient of Pakistani origin. We identified a nucleotide duplication, c.764dupA, in the cathepsin D gene in homozygous form in the patient, and in heterozygous form in his father. This duplication is likely to be disease-causing, as it creates a premature stop codon, predicting a truncation of the protein. When transiently expressed in cell cultures, the mutant protein was enzymatically inactive, but stable. In paraffin-embedded brain tissue samples of two affected siblings of the Pakistani patient, cathepsin D was absent, suggesting rapid degradation of the c.764dupA mutant cathepsin D at mRNA or protein level in vivo. Further, we were able to confirm lack of cathepsin D in the brain tissue of yet another, unrelated, patient of English origin with congenital NCL. On the basis of the present data, and the nearly identical clinical and/or pathological phenotype of the other reported cases of congenital NCL, it is reasonable to suggest that cathepsin D deficiency caused by mutations in the corresponding gene may underlie all cases of congenital NCL. The present observations also suggest that cathepsin D deficiency should be considered as a possible diagnosis in microcephalic neonates, who present with seizures at or before birth.\n",
      "We describe a boy who has an anadysplasia-like spondylometaphyseal dysplasia. By whole exome sequencing he was shown to have compound heterozygous mutations of LBR that codes for the lamin B receptor. He shares many similarities with a case previously described, but in whom the early natural history could not be established [Borovik et al., 2013]. Thus, in addition to Greenberg dysplasia (a perinatal lethal disorder), homozygosity or compound heterozygosity of mutations in LBR can result in a mild, spontaneously regressing bone dysplasia.\n",
      "BACKGROUND:Posterior amorphous corneal dystrophy is a rare condition characterized by bilateral sheet-like opacification of the posterior stroma in association with corneal flattening and thinning. It has been reported in only four families, all from the United States. The authors report on a fifth family, the first from Britain, with nine affected individuals. METHODS:Slit-lamp photography, refraction, keratometry, pachometry, corneal topography, and specular microscopy were used to assess the family members. RESULTS:Two distinct forms of the disease were identified. All patients with the centroperipheral form were hypermetropic and had keratometry readings below 41.00 diopters and a central corneal thicknesses less than 0.50 mm. Those with the less severe peripheral form were less hypermetropic, some slightly myopic, and had keratometry readings above 41.00 diopters, but the central corneal thicknesses was similar to those with the centroperipheral form. No abnormalities of the endothelium were detected, and visual acuity was only mildly affected. The condition appears to be nonprogressive. CONCLUSION:Though the centroperipheral form of posterior amorphous corneal dystrophy is more likely to lead to presentation, most patients are asymptomatic. This dystrophy can be very subtle in its appearance and easily overlooked. This led the authors to suspect that the prevalence of this condition is higher than the few reports in the ophthalmic literature suggest.\n",
      "Two brothers, age 16 months and 3 years, had a seemingly unique combination of hydrocephalus of the lateral ventricles and a low-insertion umbilicus. Both had similar mildly unusual facies and inguinal hernias; one had unilateral cryptorchidism. The older brother had tetralogy of Fallot, and the younger had mildly enlarged, echogenic kidneys with vesicoureteral reflux. Neither boy had adducted thumbs, pyramidal tract signs, or significant developmental delay. A review of the literature on familial hydrocephalus found no similar cases. A low-set umbilicus is not a frequently noted anomaly; its embryology and associated syndromes are discussed. The association of hydrocephalus and a low-set umbilicus appears to be the manifestation of a monogenic disorder in this family, and could be inherited in either an autosomal recessive or X-linked recessive manner.\n",
      "We describe in two brothers a previously apparently unreported multiple congenital anomalies/mental retardation (MCA/MR) syndrome of high, prominent forehead, vertical groove on tip of nose, \"cowlick,\" ear anomalies, acrorenal field defect (incipient unilateral triphalangism, broad halluces, with unilateral renal agenesis in one of the boys), megalencephaly associated with congenital hypotonia, severe mental retardation and highly abnormal EEG without seizures, intrauterine growth retardation and primordial shortness of stature in one brother. This is a Group III (\"provisionally private\") MCA/MR syndrome and presumed to be due to a Mendelian (either X-linked or autosomal recessive) mutation. We do not think these patients have the FG syndrome. The condition has been named the neurofaciodigitorenal (NFDR) syndrome.\n",
      "We report on a Mexican patient with mental retardation, cleft lip and palate, and facial anomalies characteristic of Kapur-Toriello syndrome described in 1991 by Kapur and Toriello in two sibs. The condition was considered a previously undescribed autosomal recessive disorder and only one patient has been reported since that time. The clinical manifestations observed in our patient confirm some characteristics as part of the entity. In view of rarity, it is necessary to describe additional cases.\n",
      "Hereditary thrombocythemia is a rare autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in either the thrombopoietin gene (TPO) or its receptor c-MPL. TPO mutations described so far lead to thrombopoietin overproduction through increased translation of m-RNA. Unilateral transverse reduction limb defects are usually sporadic and generally thought to be caused by vascular disruptions. Reports of inherited unilateral limb defects are extremely rare. In the present study, we describe a family with segregation of G185T TPO mutation in the 5' UTR region in 4 subjects with thrombocythemia. Three of these patients also present congenital transverse limb defects. Association of these events gives a strong hint of the in vivo involvement of thrombopoietin in vasculogenesis, confirming the role of TPO in human development of the hemangioblast, the embryonic progenitor of the hematopoietic and endothelial lineages. This is the first report showing that vascular disruptions could be secondary to specific gene derangements.\n",
      "Lissencephaly is a brain malformation characterized by absence of gyral formation, resulting in a smooth brain surface. Histologic study shows severe anomalies of cerebral cortical development. Several lissencephaly syndromes have been described. Here we report a familial syndrome of lissencephaly, cleft palate, diffuse agyria, and severe cerebellar hypoplasia. Microscopic examination of the abnormally thick cerebral cortex showed absence of cortical layering, with preservation of the pia-glial barrier. This is the first report of recurrent lissencephaly with cleft palate and severe cerebellar hypoplasia in which these unique neuropathology findings are described. Autosomal recessive inheritance is suggested by recurrence in sibs within the same family, but germ cell mosaicism for a dominant mutation is not excluded.\n",
      "Interstitial duplications of 8q12 encompassing CHD7 have recently been described as a new microduplication syndrome. Three 8q12 duplications have been reported with shared recognizable phenotype: Duane anomaly, developmental delay and dysmorphic facial features. We identified a 2.7 Mb duplication on chromosome 8q12 with SNP-array in a patient with growth delay, congenital heart defects, ear anomalies and torticollis. To our knowledge, this is the smallest duplication reported to date. Our findings support the notion that increased copy number of CHD7 may underlie the phenotype of the 8q12 duplication. Our study together with previous studies suggest that the 8q12 duplication could be defined as a novel syndrome.\n",
      "We describe a three-generation family with tall stature, scoliosis and macrodactyly of the great toes and a heterozygous p.Val883Met mutation in Npr2, the gene that encodes the CNP receptor NPR2 (natriuretic peptide receptor 2). When expressed in HEK293A cells, the mutant Npr2 cDNA generated intracellular cGMP (cyclic guanosine monophosphate) in the absence of CNP ligand. In the presence of CNP, cGMP production was greater in cells that had been transfected with the mutant Npr2 cDNA compared to wild-type cDNA. Transgenic mice in which the mutant Npr2 was expressed in chondrocytes driven by the promoter and intronic enhancer of the Col11a2 gene exhibited an enhanced production of cGMP in cartilage, leading to a similar phenotype to that observed in the patients. In addition, blood cGMP concentrations were elevated in the patients. These results indicate that p.Val883Met is a constitutive active gain-of-function mutation and elevated levels of cGMP in growth plates lead to the elongation of long bones. Our findings reveal a critical role for NPR2 in skeletal growth in both humans and mice, and may provide a potential target for prevention and treatment of diseases caused by impaired production of cGMP.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Recurrent and persistent hypoketotic, hypofattyacidaemic hypoglycaemia in infancy and childhood is most frequently due to hyperinsulinism of infancy. This biochemical profile can also be due to non-islet cell tumour hypoglycaemia or circulating insulin-receptor autoantibodies. Hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia is also seen in children with the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, where it is usually transient. METHODS/RESULTS: We report a novel case of child with hemihypertrophy and severe persistent hypoketotic, hypofattyacidaemic hypoinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia. No 'big' pro-IGF2 forms or circulating insulin-receptor antibodies were found. Glucose and protein isotope turnover studies showed marked suppression of hepatic glucose production during fasting. There was no evidence for constitutive autophosphorylation of the insulin or IGF-1 receptor, and no evidence for up-regulation of IGF-1 receptor. CONCLUSION: The precise pathophysiology of this novel case is still unclear.\n",
      "Mitochondrial HMG-CoA synthase deficiency is a rare inherited metabolic disorder that affects ketone-body synthesis. Acute episodes include vomiting, lethargy, hepatomegaly, hypoglycaemia, dicarboxylic aciduria, and in severe cases, coma. This deficiency may have been under-diagnosed owing to the absence of specific clinical and biochemical markers, limitations in liver biopsy and the lack of an effective method of expression and enzyme assay for verifying the mutations found. To date, eight patients have been reported with nine allelic variants of the HMGCS2 gene. We present a new method of enzyme expression and a modification of the activity assay that allows, for first time, the functional study of missense mutations found in patients with this deficiency. Four of the missense mutations (p.V54M, p.R188H, p.G212R and p.G388R) did not produce proteins that could have been detected in soluble form by western blot; three produced a total loss of activity (p.Y167C, p.M307T and p.R500H) and one, variant p.F174L, gave an enzyme with a catalytic efficiency of 11.5%. This indicates that the deficiency may occur with partial loss of activity of enzyme. In addition, we describe a new patient with this deficiency, in which we detected the missense allelic variant, c.1162G>A (p.G388R) and the nonsense variant c.1270C>T (p.R424X).\n",

      "Two brothers and their sister aged 8, 13, and 7 years were found to have unusual facies (gross, rough and abundant hair, wide forehead, mild palpebral ptosis, small nose, anteverted nostrils, thick lips, and down-slanting corners of the mouth), dysarthria, delayed psychomotor development, scoliosis, feet deformities, and limb and gait ataxia. The characteristic clinical picture in the three sibs, once compared with other ataxic syndromes, allowed one to conclude that this could correspond to a distinct entity probably inherited as an autosomal recessive disorder.\n",
      "In 2 consanguineous relationships, a Cape Verdian man fathered six fetuses (5 male) with fetal ventriculomegaly and echodense fetal kidneys as visualized by ultrasonography between 16 and 32 weeks. During prenatal monitoring, an increased alpha fetoprotein level and abnormal acetylcholinesterase were detected at amniocentesis in 5 of 6 affected fetuses. Chromosomes were normal. Five pregnancies resulted in elective termination; one child was still-born prematurely. Hydrocephalus and cystic disease of the (renal) cortico medullary areas were found. One fetus had polydactyly. The differential diagnosis and prenatal diagnosis of this presumably autosomal recessive syndrome are discussed.\n",
      "Purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive primary immunodeficiency disorder characterized by decreased numbers of T-cells, variable B-cell abnormalities, decreased amount of serum uric acid and PNP enzyme activity. The affected patients usually present with recurrent infections, neurological dysfunction and autoimmune phenomena. In this study, whole-exome sequencing was used to detect mutation in the case suspected of having primary immunodeficiency. We found a homozygous mutation in PNP gene in a girl who is the third case from the national Iranian registry. She had combined immunodeficiency, autoimmune hemolytic anemia and a history of recurrent infections. She developed no neurological dysfunction. She died at the age of 11 after a severe chicken pox infection. PNP deficiency should be considered in late-onset children with recurrent infections, autoimmune disorders without typical neurologic impairment.\n",
      "A 73-year-old woman presented with a 10-year history of asymptomatic coalescent flat pale yellow lesions forming a cobblestone pattern that resembled pseudoxanthoma elasticum over her neck, upper trunk and axillae. Skin biopsies from both the neck and axilla showed focal upper dermal elastosis with increase in structurally normal elastic fibres. There was no evidence of either pseudoxanthoma elasticum or solar elastosis in either biopsy. This under-recognized presentation has previously been identified as a distinct clinicopathological entity and termed late-onset focal dermal elastosis.\n",

      "BACKGROUND:4H syndrome is a congenital hypomyelinating leukodystrophy characterized by hypodontia, hypomyelination and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism belonging to the Pol III-related leukodystrophies which arise due to mutations in the POLR3A or POLR3B gene. The clinical presentation is of neurodevelopmental delay or regression with ataxia, dystonia, nystagmus, delayed deciduous dentition and abnormal order of eruption of teeth. MRI brain shows a characteristic hypomyelination pattern. Several mutations have been described in the implicated genes but there are no reports on mutations seen in patients from India. CASE PRESENTATION:We report a 1¬Ω¬†year old girl, only child of a non-consanguinous couple who presented with delayed developmental milestones and delayed dentition. On physical examination she had downward slanting palpebral fissures, low set ears, smooth philtrum, hypodontia, prominent body hair and clitoromegaly. There was prominent horizontal nystagmus, hypertonia of both upper and lower limbs, exaggerated deep tendon jerks and flexor planter response. She had not attained complete head control and required support to sit. She showed absent waves on brainstem evoked response audiometry and her fundus examination showed bilateral optic atrophy with prolongation of P100 latencies on visual evoked potentials. MRI Brain showed hyperintensity of entire white matter with involvement of the internal and external capsule, frontal deep white matter and corpus callosum. Her karyotype was 46 XX and her endocrinal profile was unremarkable. Clinical exome sequencing identified an unreported mutation in the POLR3A gene. The same mutation was identified by Sanger sequencing in heterozygous state in both parents. The child is being managed with physiotherapy and developmental therapy. She has been provided with hearing aids and started on speech therapy. Parents were provided anticipatory guidance and genetic counselling about autosomal recessive nature of inheritance, risk of recurrence and need for follow-up. CONCLUSION:4H syndrome is a rare congenital hypomyelinating leukodystrophy inherited as an autosomal recessive disorder due to mutations in the POLR3A and POLR3B gene. Delay or regression of milestones, abnormalities in dentition and endocrinal perturbations are its hallmark. A novel mutation in the POLR3A gene resulting in amino acid substitution of arginine for glutamine at codon 808 (p.R808Q) was detected in exon 18 in our case.\n",
      "Dermochondrocorneal Dystrophy (OMIM 221800) is a very rare disease first described by Francois in 1949. It is characterized by the appearance of skin nodules, osteochondral deformities, and corneal opacities during childhood. Only a few cases have been reported. There is uncertainty about the inheritance pattern and no gene or genes have been associated to this disease. We report a patient from Mexican mestizo origin with the classic manifestations of Dermochondrocorneal Dystrophy. We perform a multidisciplinary assessment in order to contribute to the knowledge of the clinical presentation of this uncommon condition. Among the few documented patients, this is the third patient of Mexican ancestry reported with this syndrome.\n",

      "Whole-exome sequencing of two affected sibs and their mother who showed a unique quadriceps-dominant form of neurogenic muscular atrophy disclosed a heterozygous DYNC1H1 mutation [p.H306R (c.917A>G)]. The identical mutation was recently reported in a pedigree with the axonal form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. Three other missense mutations in DYNC1H1 were also identified in families with dominant spinal muscular atrophy with lower extremity predominance. Their clinical features were consistent with those of our family. Our study has demonstrated that the same DYNC1H1 mutation could cause spinal muscular atrophy as well as distal neuropathy, indicating pleotropic effects of the mutation.\n",
      "Short stature, auditory canal atresia, mandibular hypoplasia, and skeletal abnormalities (SAMS) has been reported previously to be a rare, autosomal-recessive developmental disorder with other, unique rhizomelic skeletal anomalies. These include bilateral humeral hypoplasia, humeroscapular synostosis, pelvic abnormalities, and proximal defects of the femora. To identify the genetic basis of SAMS, we used molecular karyotyping and whole-exome sequencing (WES) to study small, unrelated families. Filtering of variants from the WES data included segregation analysis followed by comparison of in-house exomes. We identified a homozygous 306 kb microdeletion and homozygous predicted null mutations of GSC, encoding Goosecoid homeobox protein, a paired-like homeodomain transcription factor. This confirms that SAMS is a human malformation syndrome resulting from GSC mutations. Previously, Goosecoid has been shown to be a determinant at the Xenopus gastrula organizer region and a segment-polarity determinant in Drosophila. In the present report, we present data on Goosecoid protein localization in staged mouse embryos. These data and the SAMS clinical phenotype both suggest that Goosecoid is a downstream effector of the regulatory networks that define neural-crest cell-fate specification and subsequent mesoderm cell lineages in mammals, particularly during shoulder and hip formation. Our findings confirm that Goosecoid has an essential role in human craniofacial and joint development and suggest that Goosecoid is an essential regulator of mesodermal patterning in mammals and that it has specific functions in neural crest cell derivatives.\n",
      "Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the CYP27A1 gene resulting in sterol-27-hydroxylase deficiency. Current information about CTX is based mainly on case reports, with only few large series reported. Although perceived as a potentially treatable condition, efficacy of chenodeoxycholic acid plus statin therapy remains unclear. To perform a nationwide survey of confirmed cases, with a thorough analysis of genotype-phenotype data and prognostic factors.Retrospective review of the clinical and epidemiological aspects and mutations of all the patients diagnosed since 1992 in the main reference centers for genetic testing of CTX in Spain.Twenty-five patients from 19 families were identified. An average delay of 19 years was observed between symptom onset and clinical diagnosis. Two main clinical subgroups were recognizable: a classic form (cerebellar and other supratentorial symptoms) and a spinal form (chronic myelopathy). Cholestanol levels did not correlate with clinical presentation, severity or response to therapy. Despite treatment, five patients died during follow-up, one to 4 years after diagnosis. Thirteen different mutations were identified, with a higher frequency of p.R395C in Northwestern Spain and p.R405W in Southern Spain. None of the mutations could be associated with a particular clinical feature combination or prognosis.This is the first nationwide extensive series of CTX reported in Spain. The higher number of cases in some areas suggests a possible founder effect. Spinal forms had a less severe prognosis. A delayed diagnosis could contribute to the lack of significant response to treatment.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: To determine the minimum prevalence of spinocerebellar ataxia type 17 (SCA17) in the north east of England. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A defined region containing 2,516,500 individuals with 192 families with undiagnosed ataxia, 90 patients with a Huntington's disease-like phenotype and 292 controls. The number of (CAG/CAA)(n) repeats in the SCA17/TBP gene was determined by fluorescent PCR and sequenced in affected individuals. RESULTS: The mean repeat size for 584 control alleles was 34 (S.D.=3.58), ranging from 25 to 40. Two index cases had larger alleles with repeat lengths greater than the control range. Affected family members presented in adult life with ataxia followed by extrapyramidal features and cognitive impairment. In one family 44 repeats were associated with a younger age of onset than has been previously described. CONCLUSIONS: The minimum prevalence of SCA17 in the north east of England was 0.16/100,000 (upper 95% confidence interval 0.31/100,000).\n",
      "Pai syndrome was originally described as the association of a midline cleft lip, midline facial polyps, and lipoma of the central nervous system. However, only a few patients present with the full triad, and most exhibit a wide spectrum of phenotypic variability. The aim of this study was to phenotypically delineate Pai syndrome and to propose new criteria to facilitate a clinical diagnosis in the future. The study cohort consisted of seven case patients and an additional 60 cases diagnosed with Pai syndrome identified in a literature review. Only 23 of 67 patients presented the full triad as historically described by Pai et al. (1987). A congenital facial midline skin mass was always encountered, particularly affecting the nasal structures (60/67). A midline facial cleft was reported in 45 of 67 patients and a pericallosal lipoma in 42 of 67 patients. The proposed definition of Pai syndrome is the association of (1) a congenital nasal and/or mediofrontal skin mass and/or a mid-anterior alveolar process polyp as a mandatory criterion, and at least one of the following criteria: (2) midline cleft lip and/or midline alveolar cleft, and/or (3) a pericallosal lipoma or interhemispheric lipoma in the case of corpus callosum dysgenesis.\n",
      "Cant√∫ syndrome consists of hypertrichosis, osteochondrodysplasia, and cardiomegaly, and has been reported in 18 patients to date. We report an infant with Cant√∫ syndrome. In addition to typical findings, he had relatively mild radiological and cardiological manifestations. Previously undescribed findings included pyloric stenosis and elevated alkaline phosphatase levels. Brain scans showed bilateral calcification of the Arteriae thalamostriatae and widening of the outer liquor spaces and lateral ventricles. Because the propositus is the youngest patient reported to date, our findings refine the clinical spectrum of Cant√∫ syndrome in neonates and young infants. The etiology and mode of inheritance of Cant√∫ syndrome are unknown. Most cases are sporadic. Microdeletions have been discussed as a possible cause of Cant√∫ syndrome. Recently, several syndromes with multiple congenital anomalies and mental retardation have been shown to be caused by subtelomeric chromosome aberrations. We excluded the presence of a cryptic subtelomeric chromosome anomaly in our patient by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) screening with locus-specific probes.\n",
      "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Inborn errors of bile acid metabolism may present as neonatal cholestasis and fat-soluble vitamin malabsorption or as late onset chronic liver disease. Our aim was to fully characterize a defect in bile acid synthesis in a 2-week-old African-American girl presenting with coagulopathy, vitamin D and E deficiencies, and mild cholestasis and in her sibling, whose liver had been used for orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). METHODS: Bile acids were measured by mass spectrometry in urine, bile, serum, and feces of the patient and in urine from the unrelated recipient. RESULTS: Liver biopsy specimens showed neonatal hepatitis with giant cell transformation and hepatocyte necrosis; peroxisomes were reduced in number. High concentrations of (25R)3alpha,7alpha,12alpha-trihydroxy-5beta-cholestanoic acid in the urine, bile, and serum established a pattern similar to that of Zellweger syndrome and identical to the Alligator mississippiensis. Serum phytanic acid was normal, whereas pristanic acid was markedly elevated. Biochemical, MRI, and neurologic findings were inconsistent with a generalized defect of peroxisomal function and were unique. Analysis of the urine from the recipient of the deceased sibling's liver confirmed the same bile acid synthetic defect. A deficiency in 2-methylacyl-CoA racemase, which is essential for conversion of (25R)THCA to its 25S-isomer, the substrate to initiate peroxisomal beta-oxidation to primary bile acids, was confirmed by DNA analysis revealing a missense mutation (S52P) in the gene encoding this enzyme. Long-term treatment with cholic acid normalized liver enzymes and prevented progression of symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: This genetic defect further highlights bile acid synthetic defects as a cause of neonatal cholestasis.\n",
      "We report a fetus from a pregnancy that was terminated at 26 weeks gestation for hydrops and short limb skeletal dysplasia. The parents were first cousins. Post mortem examination showed pulmonary hypoplasia and hepatomegaly. The radiographs showed shortening and cortical thickening of all long bones. The cortical thickening was most marked in the long bones, ribs, clavicles and scapulae but spared the skull vault, facial bones and pelvis. There were coronal clefts in the lower lumbar vertebrae. The clinical and radiological features of this fetus conform to those reported in a stillborn male by Kozlowski and Tsuruta in 1989 (Br J Radiol 62:376-378). This is the second reported case of this condition and confirms that it is a distinct and recognisable, lethal skeletal dysplasia. The parental consanguinity in our patient suggests that this condition may be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.\n",
      "We present a 4-generation family in which affected individuals have cataracts, a motor neuronopathy with upper motor neuron signs, short stature, developmental delay, and skeletal abnormalities. An additional symptom is weakness during pregnancy which resolves after delivery. The condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. The manifestations and inheritance are not found in any previously described conditions. We consider that this is a new syndrome.\n",
      "Congenital macrothrombocytopenia is a genetically heterogeneous group of rare disorders. We identified the first TUBB1 mutation, R318W, in a patient with congenital macrothrombocytopenia. The patient was heterozygous for Q43P, but this single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) did not relate to macrothrombocytopenia. Although no abnormal platelet beta1-tubulin localization/marginal band organization was observed, the level of beta1-tubulin was decreased by approximately 50% compared with healthy controls. Large and irregular bleb protrusions observed in megakaryocytes derived from the patient's peripheral blood CD34(+) cells suggested impaired megakaryocyte fragmentation and release of large platelets. In vitro transfection experiments in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells demonstrated no incorporation of mutant beta1-tubulin into microtubules, but the formation of punctuated insoluble aggregates. These results suggested that mutant protein is prone to aggregation but is unstable within megakaryocytes/platelets. Alternatively, mutant beta1-tubulin may not be transported from the megakaryocytes into platelets. W318 beta1-tubulin may interfere with normal platelet production, resulting in macrothrombocytopenia.\n",

      "We have observed a distinct form of \"crossed\" polysyndactyly in 6 generations of a family with 5 affected persons, all males. The polydactyly is postaxial in the hands and preaxial in the feet. Syndactyly in the hands is observed in some relatives, while syndactyly in the feet is present bilaterally in all affected relatives. This seems to be an autosomal dominant trait with male to male transmission over 3 generations by examination and an additional 3 generations by history. This form of polysyndactyly could not be readily categorized by the existing classification by Temtamy and McKusick [1978: BD OAS XIV 6:363-392]. We review and expand the present classification of polydactyly and syndactyly syndromes.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) comprises a heterogeneous group of heritable deficiencies of humoral and cell-mediated immunity. Many patients with SCID have lymphocyte-activation defects that remain uncharacterized. METHODS: We performed genetic studies in four patients, from four families of Northern Cree ancestry, who had clinical characteristics of SCID, including early onset of severe viral, bacterial, and fungal infections despite normal B-cell and T-cell counts. Genomewide homozygosity mapping was used to identify a candidate region, which was found on chromosome 8; all genes within this interval were sequenced. Immune-cell populations, signal transduction on activation, and effector functions were studied. RESULTS: The patients had hypogammaglobulinemia or agammaglobulinemia, and their peripheral-blood B cells and T cells were almost exclusively of naive phenotype. Regulatory T cells and Œ≥Œ¥ T cells were absent. All patients carried a homozygous duplication--c.1292dupG in exon 13 of IKBKB, which encodes IŒ∫B kinase 2 (IKK2, also known as IKKŒ≤)--leading to loss of expression of IKK2, a component of the IKK-nuclear factor Œ∫B (NF-Œ∫B) pathway. Immune cells from the patients had impaired responses to stimulation through T-cell receptors, B-cell receptors, toll-like receptors, inflammatory cytokine receptors, and mitogens. CONCLUSIONS: A form of human SCID is characterized by normal lymphocyte development despite a loss of IKK2 function. IKK2 deficiency results in an impaired response to activation stimuli in a variety of immune cells, leading to clinically relevant impairment of adaptive and innate immunity. Although Ikk2 deficiency is lethal in mouse embryos, our observations suggest a more restricted, unique role of IKK2-NF-Œ∫B signaling in humans.

R(18) patients can therefore show features of 18q-, 18p- syndrome or a combination of both, depending on the size of the 18p and 18q deleted regions. The phenotype of the r(18) is characterized by developmental delay/mental retardation, typical facial dysmorphisms, major abnormalities and immunological problems. Here we report a case of de novo mosaic r(18) with a characterization by array-based comparative genomic hybridization analysis, and discuss the phenotypic correlation in r(18) also through a comparison with previously described cases of the literature.\n",
      "We report four sibs from a consanguineous Arab Bedouin family with short stature, mental retardation, a peculiar face, a short webbed neck, skin changes and congenital heart defects. We suggest that the constellation of abnormalities in these children could represent a newly recognized syndrome.\n",
      "Import of peroxisomal matrix proteins, crucial for peroxisome biogenesis, is mediated by the cytosolic receptors PEX5 and PEX7 that recognize proteins carrying peroxisomal targeting signals 1 or 2 (PTS1 or PTS2), respectively. Mutations in PEX5 or 12 other PEX genes cause peroxisome biogenesis disorders, collectively named the Zellweger spectrum disorders (ZSDs), whereas mutations in PEX7 cause rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata type 1 (RCDP1). Three additional RCDP types, RCDP2-3-4, are caused, respectively, by mutations in GNPAT, AGPS and FAR1, encoding enzymes involved in plasmalogen biosynthesis. Here we report a fifth type of RCDP (RCDP5) caused by a novel mutation in PEX5. In four patients with RCDP from two independent families, we identified a homozygous frame shift mutation c.722dupA (p.Val242Glyfs(‚àó)33) in PEX5 (GenBank: NM_001131023.1). PEX5 encodes two isoforms, PEX5L and PEX5S, and we show that the c.722dupA mutation, located in the PEX5L-specific exon 9, results in loss of PEX5L only. Both PEX5 isoforms recognize PTS1-tagged proteins, but PEX5L is also a co-receptor for PTS2-tagged proteins. Previous patients with PEX5 mutations had ZSD, mainly due to deficient import of PTS1-tagged proteins. Similarly to mutations in PEX7, loss of PEX5L results in deficient import of PTS2-tagged proteins only, thus causing RCDP instead of ZSD. We demonstrate that PEX5L expression restores the import of PTS2-tagged proteins in patient fibroblasts. Due to the biochemical overlap between RCDP1 and RCDP5, sequencing of PEX7 and exon 9 in PEX5 should be performed in patients with a selective defect in the import of PTS2-tagged proteins.\n",
      "Elsahy-Waters or branchioskeletogenital syndrome is a rare MCA/MR syndrome characterized by moderate mental retardation, hypospadias and characteristic craniofacial morphology, which includes brachycephaly, facial asymmetry, exotropia, hypertelorism/telechantus, broad nose, concave nasal ridge, underdeveloped midface, prognathism, and radicular dentin dysplasia. Here we report on a 44-year-old woman and her 45-year-old brother, born to consanguineous parents, who show a striking resemblance to the earlier described patients. The hitherto reported patients were male and in one pedigree parents were consanguineous. The present report of an affected woman and her brother, born to consanguineous parents, supports autosomal recessive inheritance of this condition. We provide a short review of all previously reported patients with Elsahy-Waters syndrome and related entities.\n",
      "BACKGROUND:Diphallus is an extremely rare anomaly. Numerous associated genitourinary, gastrointestinal and other anomalies have been described with diphallus. These patients need several investigations, and finally surgical intervention. CASES PRESENTATION:In this report we discuss six patients with diphallus which evaluated retrospectively. Five patients had complete diphallia, and one had bifid diphallus. Meatus was normal in 3, hypospadiac in 2, and epispadiac in one patient. The most common associated anomaly was bifid scrotum (5 cases), and other common anomalies consisted of bladder duplication (3 cases), imperforate anus (2 cases), and hypospadias (2 cases). Phalloplasty was performed for all but one. CONCLUSION:All the patients with urethral duplication have to be evaluated carefully because of the high incidence of other systemic anomalies.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: To delineate the features of a novel neurodegenerative disease. METHODS: We report three children of three related families with congenital microphthalmia and blindness, and progressive spasticity, microcephaly, seizures, and profound mental retardation. RESULTS: A magnetic resonance imaging scan was normal at birth. However, follow-up studies showed progressive atrophy involving the cerebral white matter and cortex, cerebellum, brainstem, and corpus callosum. The white matter changes extended into the subcortical region leaving only small islands of remaining cortical tissue. Known metabolic conditions involving white matter degeneration were excluded. INTERPRETATION: We propose this to be a novel autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder to be coined MOBA (microphthalmia brain atrophy) disease.\n",
      "Beta-ureidopropionase deficiency (McKusick 606673) is an autosomal recessive condition caused by mutations in the UPB1 gene. To date, five patients have been reported, including one putative case detected through newborn screening. Clinical presentation includes neurological and developmental problems. Here, we report another case of beta-ureidopropionase deficiency who presented with congenital anomalies of the urogenital and colorectal systems and with normal neurodevelopmental milestones. Analysis of a urine sample, because of the suspicion of renal stones on ultrasound, showed strongly elevated levels of the characteristic metabolites, N-carbamyl-beta-amino acids. Subsequent analysis of UPB1 identified a novel mutation 209 G>C (R70P) in exon 2 and a previously reported splice receptor mutation IVS1-2A>G. Expression studies of the R70P mutant enzyme showed that the mutant enzyme did not possess any residual activity. Long-term follow-up is required to determine the clinical significance of the beta-ureidopropionase deficiency in our patient.\n",
      "To identify the genetic defects present in 3 families with muscular dystrophy, contractures, and calpain 3 deficiency.We performed targeted exome sequencing on one patient presenting a deficiency in calpain 3 on Western blot but for which mutations in the gene had been excluded. The identification of a homozygous truncating mutation in the M-line part of titin prompted us to sequence this region in 2 additional patients presenting similar clinical and biochemical characteristics.The 3 patients shared similar features: coexistence of limb-girdle weakness and early-onset diffuse joint contractures without cardiomyopathy. The biopsies showed rimmed vacuoles, a dystrophic pattern, and secondary reduction in calpain 3. We identified a novel homozygous mutation in the exon Mex3 of the TTN gene in the first patient. At protein level, this mutation introduces a stop codon at the level of Mex3. Interestingly, we identified truncating mutations in both alleles in the same region of the TTN gene in patients from 2 additional families. Molecular protein analyses confirm loss of the C-ter part of titin.Our study broadens the phenotype of titinopathies with the report of a new clinical entity with prominent contractures and no cardiac abnormality and where the recessive mutations lead to truncation of the M-line titin and secondary calpain 3 deficiency.\n",
      "Pontocerebellar hypoplasia (PCH) is characterized by hypoplasia and atrophy of the cerebellum, variable pontine atrophy, microcephaly, severe mental and motor impairments and seizures. Mutations in 11 genes have been reported in 8 out of 10 forms of PCH. Recessive mutations in the mitochondrial arginyl-transfer RNA synthetase gene (RARS2) have been recently associated with PCH type 6, which is characterized by early-onset encephalopathy with signs of oxidative phosphorylation defect. Here we describe the clinical presentation, neuroimaging findings and molecular characterizations of two siblings with a clinical diagnosis of PCH who displayed a novel variant (c.-2A>G) in the 5'-UTR of the RARS2 gene in the homozygous state. This variant was identified through next-generation sequencing testing of a panel of nine genes known to be involved in PCH. Gene expression and functional studies demonstrated that the c.-2A>G sequence change directly leads to a reduced RARS2 messenger RNA expression in the patients by decreasing RARS2 promoter activity, thus providing evidence that mutations in the RARS2 promoter are likely to represent a new causal mechanism of PCH6.\n",
      "We report on a child with micrognathia, a short, webbed neck, joint contractures, hypoplastic nipples, and a number of other anomalies. There are striking similarities to a patient reported by [Dinno and Weisskopf (1976); Synd Ident, 4:10-12], and we postulate that this child represents the second patient with this condition.\n",
      "Multiple mitochondrial dysfunction syndromes (MMDS) comprise a group of severe autosomal recessive diseases characterized by impaired respiration and lipoic acid metabolism, resulting in infantile-onset mitochondrial encephalopathy, non-ketotic hyperglycinemia, myopathy, lactic acidosis and early death. Four different MMDS have been analyzed in detail according to the genes involved in the disease, MMDS1 (NFU1), MMDS2 (BOLA3), MMDS3 (IBA57) and MMDS4 (ISCA2). MMDS5 has recently been described in a clinical case report of patients carrying a mutation in ISCA1, but with no further functional analysis. ISCA1 encodes a mitochondrial protein essential for the assembly of [4Fe-4S] clusters in key metabolic and respiratory enzymes. Here, we describe a patient with a severe early onset leukodystrophy, multiple defects of respiratory complexes and a severe impairment of lipoic acid synthesis. A homozygous missense mutation in ISCA1 (c.29T>G; p.V10G) identified by targeted MitoExome sequencing resulted in dramatic reduction of ISCA1 protein level. The mutation located in the uncleaved presequence severely affected both mitochondrial import and stability of ISCA1. Down-regulation of ISCA1 in HeLa cells by RNAi impaired the biogenesis of mitochondrial [4Fe-4S] proteins, yet could be complemented by expression of wild-type ISCA1. In contrast, the ISCA1 p.V10G mutant protein only partially complemented the defects, closely resembling the biochemical phenotypes observed for ISCA1 patient fibroblasts. Collectively, our comprehensive clinical and biochemical investigations show that the ISCA1 p.V10G mutation functionally impaired mitochondrial [4Fe-4S] protein assembly and hence was causative for the observed clinical defects.\n",
      "Craniofacial dyssynostosis (CD) is characterized by premature fusion of the lambdoid and posterior part of the sagittal sutures, and short stature. Thus, the skull shape becomes dolichocephalic with protuberant forehead and either bulging or flat occiput. Facial changes are secondary to the skull defects, and some additional findings have also been described. We report on the first four known Spanish patients. They were unrelated and had Spanish ancestors. In the three previous reports about this syndrome, the authors hypothesized that the frequency of the gene causing CD must be rather high in the Spanish population, and relatively common in areas with Spanish ancestry. We have estimated the minimal birth prevalence of the syndrome in 0.51 per million livebirths. It has been previously suggested that the syndrome is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait, since there were two affected sisters among the nine published cases. Phenotypic variability is discussed in detail in this paper. We also underline several aspects for the anticipatory guidance of affected individuals, especially recommending a neurologic evaluation taking into account the radiologic findings in order to plan early interventions to avoid undesirable consequences of craniosynostosis. It is also recommended to perform additional studies (ophthalmologic, cardiologic, among others) to rule out the existence of associated anomalies, which are more frequent than previously considered.\n",
      "NF1 microdeletion syndrome is a common dominant genomic disorder responsible for around 5% of type I neurofibromatosis cases. The majority of cases are caused by mutations arising within the NF1 gene. NF1 microdeletion carriers present a more severe phenotype than patients with intragenic mutations, including mental retardation, cardiac anomalies and dysmorphic features. Here, we report on two brothers with mental retardation presenting a microduplication of the NF1 microdeletion syndrome region detected by array-CGH analysis. Main phenotypic features are mental deficiency, early onset of baldness (15 years old), dental enamel hypoplasia and minor facial dysmorphism. The breakpoint regions coincide with the repeats, and the recombination hot spots shown to mediate NF1 microdeletion through NAHR. A screening of the patients' familial relatives showed that this microduplication segregates in the family for at least two generations. This result demonstrates that both deletion and duplication of the NF1 region, at cytogenetic band 17q11.2, give rise to viable gametes, even if only NF1 microdeletions have been reported until now. Our study reports seven cases of NF1 microduplication within one family. Similar phenotypic abnormalities were present in most of the individuals, however, two displayed a normal phenotype, suggesting a potential incomplete penetrance of the phenotype associated with NF1 microduplication.\n",
      "Mutations in protein-O-mannose-beta1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 1 (POMGnT1) have been found in muscle-eye-brain disease, a congenital muscular dystrophy with structural eye and brain defects and severe mental retardation.To investigate whether mutations in POMGnT1 could be responsible for milder allelic variants of muscular dystrophy.Screening for mutations in POMGnT1.Tertiary neuromuscular unit.A patient with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy phenotype, with onset at 12 years of age, severe myopia, normal intellect, and decreased alpha-dystroglycan immunolabeling in skeletal muscle.A homozygous POMGnT1 missense mutation (c.1666G>A, p.Asp556Asn) was identified. Enzyme studies of the patient's fibroblasts showed an altered kinetic profile, less marked than in patients with muscle-eye-brain disease and in keeping with the relatively mild phenotype in our patient.Our findings widen the spectrum of disorders known to result from mutations in POMGnT1 to include limb-girdle muscular dystrophy with no mental retardation. We propose that this condition be known as LGMD2M. The enzyme assay used to diagnose muscle-eye-brain disease may not detect subtle abnormalities of POMGnT1 function, and additional kinetic studies must be carried out in such cases.\n",
      "We report two brothers with congenital total alopecia, mental retardation, childhood convulsions and hypergonadotropic hypogonadism. This association has not previously been reported and probably represents a new autosomal recessive condition.\n",
      "Goldberg-Shprintzen syndrome (OMIM 609460) (GOSHS) is an autosomal recessive multiple congenital anomaly syndrome distinguished by intellectual disability, microcephaly, and dysmorphic facial characteristics. Most affected individuals also have Hirschsprung disease and/or gyral abnormalities of the brain. This syndrome has been associated with KIAA1279 gene mutations at 10q22.1. Here we report a 16 yr old male patient referred to Center for Comprehensive Genetic Services, Tehran, Iran in 2015 with cardinal features of GOSHS in addition to refractory seizures. Whole exome sequencing in the patient revealed a novel nonsense (stop gain) homozygous mutation in KIAA1279 gene (KIAA1279: NM_015634:exon6:c.C976T:p.Q326X). Considering the wide range of phenotypic variations in GOSHS, relying on phenotypic characteristics for discrimination of GOSH from similar syndromes may lead to misdiagnosis. Consequently, molecular diagnostic tools would help in accurate diagnosis of such overlapping phenotypes.\n",
      "The relationship of delayed membranous cranial ossification to cranium bifidum and parietal foramina syndromes is unclear. We report on a family with delayed cranial membranous ossification (OMIM 155980) that segregates with an apparently balanced reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 2 and 3. The propositus had apparently low-set ears, proptosis, and a soft skull at birth. A radiographic survey of the skeleton showed markedly decreased ossification of the cranial bones and no other skeletal abnormalities. The mother and maternal grandmother of the propositus have brachycephaly, hypertelorism, and a history of a soft skull at birth. Chromosome analysis of peripheral blood from the propositus showed 46,XY,t(2;3)(p15;q12). The propositus, mother, and grandmother carry the same reciprocal translocation, whereas the mother's two phenotypically normal sibs have a normal karyotype. We used an STS-linked BAC resource to define the translocation breakpoint by identifying flanking BAC clones from both chromosomes 2, 1006D24 (D2S2279) and 1060A5 (D2S2231), and chromosome 3, 3D17 (WI8558) and 3D18 [CITB Human BAC Library, J.R.K.]. This represents the second report of a family with delayed membranous ossification of the cranium and the first report of the phenotype segregating with a chromosome rearrangement.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: There is confusion in the literature concerning disorders caused by EBP (emopamil-binding protein) mutations in males. OBJECTIVES: To study the clinical and genetic differences in males affected either with Conradi-H√ºnermann-Happle (CHH) syndrome (X-linked dominant chondrodysplasia punctata, CDPX2) or with a nonmosaic, X-linked recessive disorder for which we propose the acronymic term MEND syndrome (male EBP disorder with neurological defects). METHODS: We report a 7-year-old boy with a history of transient scaly erythematous lesions on his limbs, trunk and scalp soon after birth. DNA was isolated from ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid-blood samples of the patient and the four coding exons of the EBP gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction. We review all published cases of CHH syndrome in males in the literature and elaborate the clinical and genetic differences between CHH syndrome in males and MEND syndrome. RESULTS: We found at position 33 of the EBP gene the variant c.33C>A leading to the same nonsense mutation p.Y11X that had previously occurred de novo in a female with typical manifestations of CHH syndrome. When the known male cases with EBP mutations were reviewed, a striking nosological difference between the mosaic and nonmosaic phenotypes was evident. Clear-cut clinical criteria are elaborated to distinguish between CHH syndrome in males and MEND syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Because the clinical outcome and prognosis are different it is important to distinguish between males with CHH syndrome that represents a mosaic phenotype, and those with MEND syndrome that is a nonmosaic trait.\n",
      "Resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) is an inherited disease transmitted in an autosomal dominant manner. The diagnosis is suspected when peripheral thyroid hormones are increased contrasting with normal or increased levels of thyroid stimulating hormone. Usually, people harboring the rare syndrome have few or no symptoms. However, in some patients signs of hyperthyroidism may be the revealing anomalies as in the following case: A 75 year-old woman was referred to our department for a benign adrenal incidentaloma. In her medical history she was treated for systemic hypertension and diabetes mellitus for 15 years. Clinical examination did not show any sign of adrenal secretion, but discovered rapid irregular cardiac rhythm with some hyperthyroidism features such as increased sweating and upper limbs and jaw tremor. Electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation. Hormonal assessment confirmed hyperthyroidism as FT4 levels were high (mean value: 30.2pmol/L (n= 9-23)), contrasting with non-suppressed TSH levels (13.8¬µU/mL (n = 0.2 - 4)). Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging was normal. Genetic testing revealed a new heterozygous mutation on exon 10 in the THRŒ≤ gene (c.1366T>G) compatible with RTH syndrome. Screening of her children showed the same hormonal profile in five out of ten. These results confirmed RTH and the familial character.\n",
      "We report on clinical and molecular findings of two brothers that both presented with sagittal craniosynostosis, hydrocephalus, Chiari I malformation, blepharophimosis, small low-set ears, hypoplastic philtrum, radioulnar synostosis, kidney malformation, and hypogenitalism. Their father presented mild brachydactyly. Conventional cytogenetic and array CGH screening did not show any chromosomal gains or losses. Furthermore, molecular genetic screening of genes involved in different craniosynostosis syndromes, namely FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, TWIST, RECQL4, and POR genes failed to detect any mutations in genomic DNA. The unique range of clinical manifestations in these two patients and the negative findings of the molecular genetic screening suggest the hypothesis of a previously unrecognized syndrome.\n",
      "Juvenile parkinsonism can be caused by recessive mutations in several genes. Among these, homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the F-box only protein 7 gene (FBXO7) cause juvenile parkinsonism with variable degrees of pyramidal disturbances (PARK15). So far, only five families (from Iran, Italy, The Netherlands, Pakistan, and Turkey) have been reported with this form. Here, we describe a new Turkish family with homozygous FBXO7 mutation (c.1492C¬†>¬†T, p.Arg498*). Three out of nine siblings born from consanguineous parents suffered from juvenile-onset progressive parkinsonism. Mental retardation was also documented in two of them. Of note, pyramidal signs were absent. The response to dopaminergic medications was present, but limited by dyskinesias and psychiatric side effects. Further genetic analysis of this Turkish family and the Italian PARK15 family reported previously revealed that the c.1492C¬†>¬†T mutation is present on two different haplotypes in the Italian family, and one of these haplotypes is shared in homozygous state in the Turkish patients. These findings contribute to the ongoing delineation of the genetic and clinical spectrum of PARK15.\n",
      "Autosomal recessive, complete TYK2 deficiency was previously described in a patient (P1) with intracellular bacterial and viral infections and features of hyper-IgE syndrome (HIES), including atopic dermatitis, high serum IgE levels, and staphylococcal abscesses. We identified seven other TYK2-deficient patients from five families and four different ethnic groups. These patients were homozygous for one of five null mutations, different from that seen in P1. They displayed mycobacterial and/or viral infections, but no HIES. All eight TYK2-deficient patients displayed impaired but not abolished cellular responses to (a) IL-12 and IFN-Œ±/Œ≤, accounting for mycobacterial and viral infections, respectively; (b) IL-23, with normal proportions of circulating IL-17(+) T cells, accounting for their apparent lack of mucocutaneous candidiasis; and (c) IL-10, with no overt clinical consequences, including a lack of inflammatory bowel disease. Cellular responses to IL-21, IL-27, IFN-Œ≥, IL-28/29 (IFN-Œª), and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) were normal. The leukocytes and fibroblasts of all seven newly identified TYK2-deficient patients, unlike those of P1, responded normally to IL-6, possibly accounting for the lack of HIES in these patients. The expression of exogenous wild-type TYK2 or the silencing of endogenous TYK2 did not rescue IL-6 hyporesponsiveness, suggesting that this phenotype was not a consequence of the TYK2 genotype. The core clinical phenotype of TYK2 deficiency is mycobacterial and/or viral infections, caused by impaired responses to IL-12 and IFN-Œ±/Œ≤. Moreover, impaired IL-6 responses and HIES do not appear to be intrinsic features of TYK2 deficiency in humans.\n",
      "We report on seven patients affected with Nevo syndrome, a rare, autosomal recessive disorder characterized by increased perinatal length, kyphosis, muscular hypotonia, and joint laxity. Since its first description by Nevo et al. [1974], only a few cases have been reported. Because some of these patients present clinical features similar to those of the kyphoscoliotic type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS VIA), an inherited connective tissue disorder characterized by a deficiency of lysyl hydroxylase due to mutations in PLOD1, we studied seven patients with Nevo syndrome, three of whom have previously been reported, and four of whom are new. In the five patients from whom urine was available, the ratio of total urinary lysyl pyridinoline (LP) to hydroxylysyl pyridinoline (HP) was elevated (8.2, 7.8, 8.6, 3.5, and 4.8, respectively) compared with that in controls (0.20 +/- 0.05, range 0.10-0.38), and similar to that observed in patients with EDS VIA (5.97 +/- 0.99, range 4.3-8.1). Six patients were homozygous for a point mutation in exon 9 of PLOD1 causing a p.R319X nonsense mutation, while one patient was homozygous for a large deletion comprising exon 17 of PLOD1. We conclude that the Nevo syndrome is allelic to and clinically indistinguishable from EDS VIA, and present evidence that increased length at birth and wristdrop, in addition to muscular hypotonia and kyphoscoliosis, should prompt the physician to consider EDS VIA earlier than heretofore.\n",
      "We report on a girl with Giuffr√®-Tsukahara syndrome manifesting microcephaly, mental retardation, radio-ulnar synostosis, short stature and scoliosis. Skewed X-inactivation was not observed in our patient. We reviewed previous reports and provide evidence in support of X-linked dominant inheritance of this condition.\n",
      "Mitochondria are dynamic organelles which undergo continuous fission and fusion to maintain their diverse cellular functions. Components of the fission machinery are partly shared between mitochondria and peroxisomes, and inherited defects in two such components (dynamin-related protein (DRP1) and ganglioside-induced differentiation-associated protein 1 (GDAP1)) have been associated with human disease. Deficiency of a third component (mitochondrial fission factor, MFF) was recently reported in one index patient, rendering MFF another candidate disease gene within the expanding field of mitochondrial and peroxisomal dynamics. Here we investigated three new patients from two families with pathogenic mutations in MFF.The patients underwent clinical examination, brain MRI, and biochemical, cytological and molecular analyses, including exome sequencing.The patients became symptomatic within the first year of life, exhibiting seizures, developmental delay and acquired microcephaly. Dysphagia, spasticity and optic and peripheral neuropathy developed subsequently. Brain MRI showed Leigh-like patterns with bilateral changes of the basal ganglia and subthalamic nucleus, suggestive of impaired mitochondrial energy metabolism. However, activities of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes were found to be normal in skeletal muscle. Exome sequencing revealed three different biallelic loss-of-function variants in MFF in both index cases. Western blot studies of patient-derived fibroblasts indicated normal content of mitochondria and peroxisomes, whereas immunofluorescence staining revealed elongated mitochondria and peroxisomes. Furthermore, increased mitochondrial branching and an abnormal distribution of fission-mediating DRP1 were observed.Our findings establish MFF loss of function as a cause of disturbed mitochondrial and peroxisomal dynamics associated with early-onset Leigh-like basal ganglia disease. We suggest that, even if laboratory findings are not indicative of mitochondrial or peroxisomal dysfunction, the co-occurrence of optic and/or peripheral neuropathy with seizures warrants genetic testing for MFF mutations.\n",
      "Stormorken syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by a phenotype that includes miosis, thrombocytopenia/thrombocytopathy with bleeding time diathesis, intellectual disability, mild hypocalcemia, muscle fatigue, asplenia, and ichthyosis. Using targeted sequencing and whole-exome sequencing, we identified the c.910C > T transition in a STIM1 allele (p.R304W) only in patients and not in their unaffected family members. STIM1 encodes stromal interaction molecule 1 protein (STIM1), which is a finely tuned endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) sensor. The effect of the mutation on the structure of STIM1 was investigated by molecular modeling, and its effect on function was explored by calcium imaging experiments. Results obtained from calcium imaging experiments using transfected cells together with fibroblasts from one patient are in agreement with impairment of calcium homeostasis. We show that the STIM1 p.R304W variant may affect the conformation of the inhibitory helix and unlock the inhibitory state of STIM1. The p.R304W mutation causes a gain of function effect associated with an increase in both resting Ca(2+) levels and store-operated calcium entry. Our study provides evidence that Stormorken syndrome may result from a single-gene defect, which is consistent with Mendelian-dominant inheritance.\n",
      "Next-generation sequencing technology aided the identification of the underlying genetic cause in a female newborn with a severe neuromuscular disorder. The patient presented generalized hypotonia, congenital bone fractures, lack of spontaneous movements and poor respiratory effort. She died within the first days of life. Karyotyping and screening for several genes related with neuromuscular diseases all tested negative. A male sibling was subsequently born with the same clinical presentation. Whole-exome sequencing was performed with variant filtering assuming a recessive disease model. Analysis focused on genes known to be related firstly with congenital myopathies, extended to muscle diseases and finally to other neuromuscular disorders. No disease-causing variants were identified. A similar disorder was described in patients with recessive variants in two genes: TRIP4 (three families) and ASCC1 (one family), both encoding subunits of the nuclear activating signal cointegrator 1 (ASC-1) complex. Our patient was also found to have a homozygous frameshift variant (c.157dupG, p.Glu53Glyfs*19) in ASCC1 , thereby representing the second known case. This confirms ASCC1 involvement in a severe neuromuscular disease lying within the spinal muscular atrophy or primary muscle disease spectra.\n",
      "Since 1980, about 100 types of congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) have been reported representing an expanding group of inherited disorders. ALG8-CDG (= CDG-Ih) is one of the less frequently reported types of CDG, maybe due to its severe multi-organ involvement with coagulation disturbances, edema, massive gastrointestinal protein loosing enteropathy, cataracts, and often early death. We report three additional patients, provide an update on two previously reported, and summarize features of ten patients reported in literature.Of 15 ALG8-CDG patients, three were homozygous and 12 compound heterozygous. There were multiple prenatal abnormalities in 6/12 patients. In 13/15, there were symptoms at birth, 9/15 died within 12¬†months. Birth weight was appropriate in 11/12, only one was small for gestational age. Prematurity was reported in 7/12. Hydrops fetalis was noticed in 3, edemas in 11/13; gastrointestinal symptoms in 9/14; structural brain pathology, psychomental retardation, seizures, ataxia in 12/13, muscle hypotonia in 13/14. Common dysmorphic signs were: low set ears, macroglossia, hypertelorism, pes equinovarus, campto- and brachydactyly (13/15). In 10/11, there was coagulopathy, in 8/11 elevated transaminases; thrombocytopenia was present in 9/9. Eye involvement was reported in 9/14. CDG typical skin involvement was reported in 8/13.In ALG8-CDG, isoelectric focusing of transferrin in serum or plasma shows an abnormal sialotransferrin pattern. The diagnosis is confirmed by mutation analysis in ALG8; all patients reported so far had point mutations or small deletions. The prognosis is generally poor. Thus, a timely and correct diagnosis is important for counselling.\n",
      "We report on a baby presenting with ectrodactyly, heart defects, and mild facial dysmorphisms, an association recognized as acro-cardio-facial syndrome (ACFS). Based on the first three observations, the acronym CCGE, cleft palate, cardiac defect, genital anomalies, and ectrodactyly had been proposed to embrace the most consistent features of this syndrome. A subsequent report and the present patient point to an obvious interindividual and intrafamilial variability of this autosomal recessive disorder in which ectrodactyly was the sole characteristic shared by all affected individuals.\n",
      "Spinocerebellar ataxia type 31 (SCA31), is a recently defined subtype of autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia (ADCA) characterized by late-onset pure cerebellar ataxia. SCA31 is common in Japan but whether or not it exists in other countries is still unclear. In this study, the authors describe a sporadic Chinese patient with SCA31. Although the cardinal clinical features, i.e., late-onset cerebellar ataxia and hearing impairment in our sporadic patient were similar to those described previously in Japan, mild axonal sensorimotor neuropathy was identified in our SCA31 patient, which is somewhat distinct from most prior reports of the disease. This is the first report of SCA31 in China; thus, extending the ethnic association beyond families of Japanese origin. In addition, our study suggests that the clinical features of SCA31 might be broader than previously thought.\n",

The differential diagnosis to similar syndromes is discussed. This combination of problems apparently has not yet been described. The term adrenomyodystrophy is suggested.\n",

Renal biopsy showed the histopathologic electron microscopic changes seen in hereditary osteo-onchyodysplasia (HOOD) [Hoyer et al, 1972; Bennet et al, 1973; DelPozo and Lapp 1970; Vernier et al, 1974; Morita et al, 1973] or \"nail-patella syndrome.\" Neither the patient nor his relatives had bone or nail abnormalities; however, 2 other sibs had died of complications of end-stage renal disease at age 6 and 9, leading us to suspect autosomal recessive inheritance of a severe nephropathy or glomerulodysplasia.\n",
      "Two observations of hereditary and bullous acrokeratotic poikiloderma of Weary and Kindler are studied. They are transmitted in dominance on two generations. The neonatal presentation of the first observation makes us discuss an epidermolysis bullosa; but the spontaneous regression, the appearance of a reticular pigmentation and the analysis of the paternal dyschromia allow the correction of the diagnosis. Forty-one observations are actually known. The blisters are present in 95 p. 100 of the cases, the dyschromia in 90 p. 100 and the keratosis on 60 p. 100. The trisymptomatic and bisymptomatic forms prevail. The mechanism of the disease is unrecognized but the vacuolization of the basal epidermic cells seems to be at the origin of the bullous eruption.\n",
      "A 14-month-old female infant with a syndrome mainly consisting of cortical blindness, psychomotor retardation and postaxial polydactyly (type B in hands and type A in feet) was studied. Two deceased sibs were similarly affected. Differential diagnosis and the review of medical literature permit the individualization of a distinct syndrome with a probable autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance.\n",
      "This is the second report of a dominantly inherited syndrome of facial asymmetry, esotropia, and amblyopia (Bencze syndrome). The phenotypic spectrum is expanded to include submucous cleft palate. The observation for the first time of male-to-male transmission seems to confirm an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. The facial asymmetry in this family was mild and did not require surgical intervention. With the exception of one patient who had other abnormalities, intelligence was normal.\n",
      "Mutations in the ATP13A2 (PARK9) and FBXO7 (PARK15) genes are linked to different forms of autosomal recessive juvenile-onset neurodegenerative diseases with overlapping phenotypes, including levodopa-responsive parkinsonism, pyramidal disturbances, cognitive decline, and supranuclear gaze disturbance. However, the associated genotypes and phenotypes are poorly characterized due to the small number of patients described. Here, we report clinical, instrumental, and genetic findings in an Italian family with novel PARK9 and PARK15 mutations. The proband developed a severe progressive phenotype including juvenile-onset parkinsonism, pyramidal disturbances, cognitive decline, and oculomotor abnormalities. On the contrary, his brother only shows mild abnormalities (pyramidal, cognitive, and oculomotor) on the neurological examination at the age of 31 years. These two brothers both carry a novel homozygous PARK9 missense (p.G877R) and a novel heterozygous PARK15 mutation (p.R481C). The PARK9 mutation replaces a crucial residue for the ATPase activity, and is therefore most likely a loss-of-function mutation and disease-causing in homozygous state. The pathogenic significance of the PARK15 single heterozygous mutation remains unclear. In both sibs, DaTSCAN single photon emission computed tomography showed marked nigrostriatal dopaminergic defects, and transcranial magnetic stimulation detected prolonged central motor conduction time. MRI, including T2*-weighted imaging, detected no evidence of brain iron accumulation. This family, the third reported with homozygous PARK9 mutations and the first with mutations in two genes for atypical juvenile parkinsonism, illustrates that PARK9-linked disease might display wide intra-familial clinical variability and milder phenotypes, suggesting the existence of strong, still unknown, modifiers.\n",
      "Intellectual disability (ID) affects approximately 1%-3% of humans with a gender bias toward males. Previous studies have identified mutations in more than 100 genes on the X chromosome in males with ID, but there is less evidence for de novo mutations on the X chromosome causing ID in females. In this study we present 35 unique deleterious de novo mutations in DDX3X identified by whole exome sequencing in 38 females with ID and various other features including hypotonia, movement disorders, behavior problems, corpus callosum hypoplasia, and epilepsy. Based on our findings, mutations in DDX3X are one of the more common causes of ID, accounting for 1%-3% of unexplained ID in females. Although no de novo DDX3X mutations were identified in males, we present three families with segregating missense mutations in DDX3X, suggestive of an X-linked recessive inheritance pattern. In these families, all males with the DDX3X variant had ID, whereas carrier females were unaffected. To explore the pathogenic mechanisms accounting for the differences in disease transmission and phenotype between affected females and affected males with DDX3X missense variants, we used canonical Wnt defects in zebrafish as a surrogate measure of DDX3X function in vivo. We demonstrate a consistent loss-of-function effect of all tested de novo mutations on the Wnt pathway, and we further show a differential effect by gender. The differential activity possibly reflects a dose-dependent effect of DDX3X expression in the context of functional mosaic females versus one-copy males, which reflects the complex biological nature of DDX3X mutations.\n",
      "The occurrence of a polymalformation pattern associated with a polydactyly indicates a mendelian inheritance. We report a case with renal hypoplasia, polydactyly, congenital heart defects. A large literature review makes the differential diagnosis and brings this case nearer to an anterior observation of the literature. We discuss an eventual new syndrome with autosomal recessive inheritance.\n",
      "We report on a previously undescribed syndrome characterized by generalized skeletal alterations and overgrowth in three unrelated individuals: a boy who died at age 16 years, a 16-year-old girl, and a 15-month-old boy. The skeletal changes included bony overgrowth of the skull base, spondylar dysplasia, and undermodeling of the tubular bones. Bone age was accelerated in early childhood. Overgrowth, which was independent of GH-IGF axis, was of prenatal onset in the two boys, but postnatal in the girl. In the two adolescents, growth rate did not decline with age, and high-dose estrogen therapy failed to induce physeal fusion. Their adolescent height reached +4 approximately +7 SD of the mean. Delayed puberty in the girl and cryptorchidism and hypospadias in the younger boy raised the possibility that hypogonadism is a syndromic constituent. Molecular analysis of IGF2, GPC3, and FGFR3 in the older boy yielded no abnormalities.\n",
      "Two extremely rare cases of adults with univentricular hearts of right ventricular morphology are presented. Pathogenesis and pathophysiology of univentricular circulation as well as anatomic variants, short information on prognosis and management are briefly discussed. Echocardiographic diagnosis of univentricular heart is described. The first case was a 23-year-old housewife with univentricular heart, functionally common atrium, single atrio-ventricular valve of tricuspid morphology, transposition of great arteries and significant subvalvular pulmonary stenosis. The second case was a 19-year-old student with univentricular heart with moderately depressed systolic function, common atrium, single atrio-ventricular valve of tricuspid morphology, mitral atresia, and non-communication residual left ventricle. Both patients led a normal life with little to moderate limitations of everyday activity.\n",
      "We report on a developmental malformation of the lung and kidney which has not been previously described and which we have chosen to call \"cystic hamartomata of the lung and kidney\" to emphasize the non-malignant nature of these lesions. We also confirm a previous case report by Weinberg and Zumwalt [1977] as a different distinct disorder that results in a multifocal cystic hamartomata of the lung with associated marked parenchymal overgrowth of the kidney (the Weinberg-Zumwalt syndrome). These cases represent a spectrum of abnormal morphogenesis affecting both kidney and lung. Patients 1 and 2 presented during infancy with abdominal masses and hypertension due to bilateral multilocular cysts of the kidney with associated hamartomatous pulmonary cysts; patient 2 also had one area of cellular mesoblastic nephroma. Patient 3 demonstrated markedly hyperplastic renomegaly with medullary dysplasia in association with bilateral cystic hamartomata of the lungs. During the fifth week of gestation, the ureteric bud invades the unsegmented mesoderm that becomes the metanephric system, and the lung bud invades the splanchic mesoderm, which provides the stimulus for its growth. We suggest that the predominant pattern of a congenital kidney or lung hamartoma might reflect the timing of a prenatal neoplastic event affecting these developmental processes.\n",
      "OBJECTIVES: To report two cases of cleft palate lateral synechia (CPLS) syndrome in a single family and describe surgical closure using the synechia. STUDY DESIGN: Case report and literature review. METHODS: A case report is presented with a review of the literature of cleft palate in conjunction with lateral synechia. Clinical presentation with photographic images of surgical repair is presented as well as a genetic workup with pedigree. RESULTS: A 6-week-old male presented for evaluation of a cleft palate. Mucosa-lined, fibromuscular tissue bands were noted connecting the floor of mouth and the free edges of a bilateral complete secondary cleft palate. No other craniofacial, digital, genital or limb defects were noted. The patient's 13-month-old sister had similar synechial bands and cleft palate at birth. Another older sibling had cleft palate without synechia. The patient's mother and maternal great grandmother had cleft palates at birth without synechia. The three children share a common mother but have three different fathers. Genetic analysis failed to reveal chromosomal defects or a mutation in the interferon regulatory factor 6 (IRF6) gene, a locus linked to Van der Woude syndrome. At 2 years of age, the index patient was growing and feeding well. His intra-oral bands remained intact and were incorporated in the surgical repair using a novel approach. CONCLUSIONS: Since more otolaryngologists are performing cleft surgeries, the awareness of the differential diagnoses associated with a cleft palate is important. CPLS is an extremely rare condition. The report of this family supports the suspected pattern of autosomal dominant inheritance with variable expressivity. The unusual surgical approach will be discussed.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE:Mutations in TPM3, encoding Tpm3.12, cause a clinically and histopathologically diverse group of myopathies characterized by muscle weakness. We report two patients with novel de novo Tpm3.12 single glutamic acid deletions at positions ŒîE218 and ŒîE224, resulting in a significant hypercontractile phenotype with congenital muscle stiffness, rather than weakness, and respiratory failure in one patient. METHODS:The effect of the Tpm3.12 deletions on the contractile properties in dissected patient myofibers was measured. We used quantitative in vitro motility assay to measure Ca(2+) sensitivity of thin filaments reconstituted with recombinant Tpm3.12 ŒîE218 and ŒîE224. RESULTS:Contractility studies on permeabilized myofibers demonstrated reduced maximal active tension from both patients with increased Ca(2+) sensitivity and altered cross-bridge cycling kinetics in ŒîE224 fibers. In vitro motility studies showed a two-fold increase in Ca(2+) sensitivity of the fraction of filaments motile and the filament sliding velocity concentrations for both mutations. INTERPRETATION:These data indicate that Tpm3.12 deletions ŒîE218 and ŒîE224 result in increased Ca(2+) sensitivity of the troponin-tropomyosin complex, resulting in abnormally active interaction of the actin and myosin complex. Both mutations are located in the charged motifs of the actin-binding residues of tropomyosin 3, thus disrupting the electrostatic interactions that facilitate accurate tropomyosin binding with actin necessary to prevent the on-state. The mutations destabilize the off-state and result in excessively sensitized excitation-contraction coupling of the contractile apparatus. This work expands the phenotypic spectrum of TPM3-related disease and provides insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms of the actin-tropomyosin complex.\n",
      "BACKGROUND:Three pregnancies with male offspring in one family were complicated by severe polyhydramnios and prematurity. One fetus died; the other two had transient massive salt-wasting and polyuria reminiscent of antenatal Bartter's syndrome. METHODS:To uncover the molecular cause of this possibly X-linked disease, we performed whole-exome sequencing of DNA from two members of the index family and targeted gene analysis of other members of this family and of six additional families with affected male fetuses. We also evaluated a series of women with idiopathic polyhydramnios who were pregnant with male fetuses. We performed immunohistochemical analysis, knockdown and overexpression experiments, and protein-protein interaction studies. RESULTS:We identified a mutation in MAGED2 in each of the 13 infants in our analysis who had transient antenatal Bartter's syndrome. MAGED2 encodes melanoma-associated antigen D2 (MAGE-D2) and maps to the X chromosome. We also identified two different MAGED2 mutations in two families with idiopathic polyhydramnios. Four patients died perinatally, and 11 survived. The initial presentation was more severe than in known types of antenatal Bartter's syndrome, as reflected by an earlier onset of polyhydramnios and labor. All symptoms disappeared spontaneously during follow-up in the infants who survived. We showed that MAGE-D2 affects the expression and function of the sodium chloride cotransporters NKCC2 and NCC (key components of salt reabsorption in the distal renal tubule), possibly through adenylate cyclase and cyclic AMP signaling and a cytoplasmic heat-shock protein. CONCLUSIONS:We found that MAGED2 mutations caused X-linked polyhydramnios with prematurity and a severe but transient form of antenatal Bartter's syndrome. MAGE-D2 is essential for fetal renal salt reabsorption, amniotic fluid homeostasis, and the maintenance of pregnancy. (Funded by the University of Groningen and others.).\n",
      "Fibroblastic rheumatism (FR) is a rare condition characterized by symmetrical polyarthritis and multiple cutaneous nodules. Approximately 30 cases have been reported worldwide to date. Laboratory tests are not particular useful to confirm the disease. Diagnosis is mainly dependent on the characteristic histopathological features: thickened collagen fibres with spindle-shaped cell proliferation in the skin lesion. We report a case of a 48-year-old Chinese man with typical clinical features of FR. In addition to the characteristic histopathological findings, multinuclear giant cell infiltration in skin lesions was detected, in this case. The evaluation of microelements revealed a raised blood lead level) of 129¬†Œºg/L (normal range 0-99¬†Œºg/L) These two features have never been described in the previous medical literature on FR. Thus, we propose that examining the infiltrated cells in detail in histopathological studies and inspecting the levels of lead and other microelements in the blood may increase our understanding of the pathogenesis of FR.\n",
      "Brain MR images of a 14-month-old boy with lissencephaly and cerebellar hypoplasia showed numerous radiating linear structures in the white matter. This finding was identical to the tigroid or leopard-skin pattern that is seen in Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease or metachromatic leukodystrophy and represents the perivascular white matter spared from demyelination. We speculate that mutations of the reelin gene, expressed both in the cortex and in the white matter, may play an important role in its development.\n",
      "The paroxysmal dyskinesias are a challenging group of movement disorders characterised by painless dystonic and/or choreiform movements. Lack of familiarity with their features and a normal neurological examination between attacks frequently cause diagnostic delays, or even the diagnosis of a non-organic disorder. They are classified by their mode of triggering, and also by the duration and frequency of attacks, effectiveness of medication, and any associated syndromes. Four subtypes are recognised: paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia induced by sudden movement; paroxysmal non-kinesigenic dyskinesia precipitated by for instance alcohol or caffeine; paroxysmal exercise-induced dyskinesia triggered by longer lasting activity; and paroxysmal hypnogenic dyskinesia occurring during sleep. Here we will summarise the characteristics of the subtypes, discuss the differential diagnosis, genetic aspects and pathophysiology, and give practical advice on the diagnostic work-up and treatment.\n",
      "Hypogranular platelet disorders in human subjects are relatively rare. They include the gray platelet syndrome, Œ±Œ¥ storage pool deficiency, the Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome, and the white platelet syndrome. Perhaps the rarest of them all is the Medich giant platelet disorder. No additional cases of this condition have been reported since description of the first case in 2004. This study describes two children with thrombocytopenia and giant, hypogranular platelets found shortly after birth. Electron microscopic study of their platelets revealed sheets of membrane wrapped into tubes resembling scrolls. The scroll-like structures were open at both ends and often filled with glycogen particles. The abnormal structures are identical to those found in the initial case. As a result, the disorder can now be referred to as the Medich giant platelet syndrome.\n",
      "We report on 11 patients from 8 families with a blepharophimosis and mental retardation syndrome (BMRS) phenotype. Using current nosology, five sporadic patients have Ohdo syndrome, associated with congenital hypothyroidism in two of them (thus also compatible with a diagnosis of Young-Simpson syndrome). In two affected sibs with milder phenotype, compensated hypothyroidism was demonstrated. In another family, an affected boy was born to the unaffected sister of a previously reported patient. Finally, in the last sibship, two affected boys in addition had severe microcephaly and neurological anomalies. A definitive clinical and etiologic classification of BMRS is lacking, but closer phenotypic analysis should lead to a more useful appraisal of the BMRS phenotype. We suggest discontinuing the systematic use of the term \"Ohdo syndrome\" when referring to patients with BMRS. We propose a classification of BMRS into five groups: (1) del(3p) syndrome, (possibly overlooked in older reports); (2) BMRS, Ohdo type, limited to the original patients of Ohdo; (3) BMRS SBBYS (Say-Barber/Biesecker/Young-Simpson) type, with distinctive dysmorphic features and inconstant anomalies including heart defect, optic atrophy, deafness, hypoplastic teeth, cleft palate, joint limitations, and hypothyroidism. BMRS type SBBYS is probably an etiologically heterogeneous phenotype, as AD and apparently AR forms exist; (4) BMRS, MKB (Maat-Kievit-Brunner) type, with coarse, triangular face, which is probably sex-linked; (5) BMRS V (Verloes) type, a probable new type with severe microcephaly, hypsarrhythmia, adducted thumbs, cleft palate, and abnormal genitalia, which is likely autosomal recessive. Types MKB and V are newly described here.\n",
      "Frontonasal Dysplasia (FND) and Oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum (OAVS) are two well-recognized clinical entities. With features of both FND and OAVS, the term oculoauriculofrontonasal syndrome (OAFNS) was coined in 1981. The OAFNS phenotype combines elements of abnormal morphogenesis of the frontonasal and maxillary process (derived from forebrain neural crest) with abnormal development of the first and second branchial arches (derived from hindbrain neural crest). We present a case series of 33 children with OAFNS ascertained from a comprehensive review of the literature and report an additional retrospective series of eight patients displaying features consistent with OAFNS. Notably, in a subset of our cases, we have observed abnormalities in nasal ossification and bony structures of the maxilla that have not previously described in OAFNS and are not seen in either FND or OAVS. We present the phenotype and novel naso-maxillary findings and explore potential etiologic and developmental pathways for OAFNS. We highlight the differences in phenotypic characteristics of OAFNS compared to OAVS and FND. These observations support the classification of OAFNS as a discrete syndrome. Further phenotypic refinements of OAFNS are needed to understand pathogenesis of this syndrome and the newly described nasal malformation may help identify the etiology.\n",
      "We report on 2 brothers with arthrogryposis, hyperkeratosis, and severe hypoplasia of dorsal roots and posterior columns in the one sib who was examined at autopsy. This appears to represent a new arthrogryposis syndrome with poor prognosis, most likely inherited as a single gene, either autosomal or X-linked recessive trait.\n",
      "We report on 5 sibs (4 males, 1 female) with growth retardation, severe pelvic hypoplasia, arthrogrypotic changes and muscular hypotrophy of the lower limbs, and mild vertebral changes of prenatal onset. To our knowledge, this syndrome has not yet been reported. The family history suggests autosomal-recessive inheritance.\n",
      "Hereditary congenital facial paralysis is rare. This paper presents a pedigree of four generations of a family of about 100 members, nine of whom suffer from congenital facial paresis, three with impaired hearing, and three with both facial paresis and impaired hearing. Heredity is dominant with reduced penetrance.\n",
      "Skeletal dysplasias are highly variable Mendelian phenotypes. Molecular diagnosis of skeletal dysplasias is complicated by their extreme clinical and genetic heterogeneity. We describe a clinically recognizable autosomal-recessive disorder in four affected siblings from a consanguineous Saudi family, comprising progressive spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia, short stature, facial dysmorphism, short fourth metatarsals, and intellectual disability. Combined autozygome/exome analysis identified a homozygous frameshift mutation in RSPRY1 with resulting nonsense-mediated decay. Using a gene-centric \"matchmaking\" system, we were able to identify a Peruvian simplex case subject whose phenotype is strikingly similar to the original Saudi family and whose exome sequencing had revealed a likely pathogenic homozygous missense variant in the same gene. RSPRY1 encodes a hypothetical RING and SPRY domain-containing protein of unknown physiological function. However, we detect strong RSPRY1 protein localization in murine embryonic osteoblasts and periosteal cells during primary endochondral ossification, consistent with a role in bone development. This study highlights the role of gene-centric matchmaking tools to establish causal links to genes, especially for rare or previously undescribed clinical entities.\n",
      "We describe a male and his sister's son with microcephaly, microphthalmia, microcornea, congenital cataract, hypogenitalism, severe mental deficiency, progressive spasticity and growth retardation. Both affected males have brachycephaly, upslanting palpebral fissures, epicanthal folds, highly arched palate, small mouth, and retrognathia. Two maternal cousins of the propositus's mother may also have been affected. Chromosomal and metabolic findings in the propositus were normal. To our knowledge, this disorder has not been reported before as an X-linked syndrome.\n",
      "The enzyme 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid dioxygenase (HPD) catalyzes the reaction of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid to homogentisic acid in the tyrosine catabolism pathway. A deficiency in the catalytic activity of HPD may lead to tyrosinemia type III, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by elevated levels of blood tyrosine and massive excretion of tyrosine derivatives into urine. It has been postulated that hawkinsinuria, an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the excretion of 'hawkinsin,' may also be a result of HPD deficiency. Hawkinsin is a sulfur amino acid identified as (2-l-cystein-S-yl, 4-dihydroxycyclohex-5-en-1-yl)acetic acid. Patients with hawkinsinuria excrete this metabolite in their urine throughout their life, although symptoms of metabolic acidosis and tyrosinemia improve in the first year of life. We performed analyses of the HPD gene in a patient with tyrosinemia type III and two unrelated patients with hawkinsinuria. A homozygous missense mutation predicting an Ala to Val change at codon 268 (A268V) in the HPD gene was found in the patient with tyrosinemia type III. A heterozygous missense mutation predicting an Ala to Thr change at codon 33 (A33T) was found in the same HPD gene in the two patients with hawkinsinuria. These findings support the hypothesis that alterations in the structure and activity of HPD are causally related to two different metabolic disorders, tyrosinemia type III and hawkinsinuria.\n",
      "We describe the ninth variant of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL) or Batten disease, due to defects in a putative new gene, CLN9. We therefore refer to the new variant as CLN9-deficient. Two Serbian sisters and two German brothers are described. Their clinical history is characteristic for juvenile NCL. They show similar gene expression patterns. The existence of this variant is supported by the presence of curvilinear inclusions, fingerprint profiles, and granular osmiophilic deposits in neurons, lymphocytes, and conjunctival cells. Enzyme screening and sequencing of the coding regions of other NCL genes was negative. CLN9-deficient cells have a distinctive phenotype. They have rounded cell bodies, have prominent nucleoli, attach poorly to the culture dish, and are sensitive to apoptosis but have increased growth rates. Gene expression of proteins involved in cell adhesion and apoptosis is altered in these cells. Sphingolipid metabolism is also perturbed. They have decreased levels of ceramide, sphingomyelin, lactosylceramide, ceramide trihexoside, and globoside and increased activity of serine palmitoyl transferase.\n",
      "The mitochondrial respiratory chain comprises 85 subunits, 13 of which are mitochondrial encoded. The synthesis of these 13 proteins requires many nuclear-encoded proteins that participate in mitochondrial DNA replication, transcript production, and a distinctive mitochondrial translation apparatus. We report a patient with agenesis of corpus callosum, dysmorphism, and fatal neonatal lactic acidosis with markedly decreased complex I and IV activity in muscle and liver and a generalized mitochondrial translation defect identified in pulse-label experiments. The defect was associated with marked reduction of the 12S rRNA transcript level likely attributed to a nonsense mutation in the MRPS16 gene. A new group of mitochondrial respiratory chain disorders is proposed, resulting from mutations in nuclear encoded components of the mitochondrial translation apparatus.\n",
      "We report on a previously apparently undescribed Puretic syndrome-like self-limited autosomal recessive disorder with onset in infancy and running its course by 11 yr in five sibs in a Kirghizian family with recurrent skin ulceration, arthralgias, fever, fistulous osteolysis around joints, oligodontia, nail dystrophy and keratitis with visual impairment or blindess in three of the five affected sibs. Affected hands and feet acquire a pseudoacromegalic appearance; fingers become clawed; involvement of growth plates around knees may lead to asymmetrical shortness with secondary scoliosis. Slow but normal healing during and after the course of the disease leaves severe cicatrization and chronic arthroses. No other organ system is involved, intellect is normal, and health and reproductive capacity are otherwise unimpaired. We propose the name Kirghizian dermatoosteolysis for this condition.\n",
      "The group of ELAC2-related encephalomyopathies is a recent addition to the rapidly growing heterogeneous mitochondrial disorders.We describe a highly inbred consanguineous Pakistani family with multiple affected children in 2 branches exhibiting moderately severe global developmental delay. Using homozygosity mapping, we mapped the phenotype in this family to a single locus on chromosome 17. In addition, whole-exome sequencing identified a homozygous splicing mutation (c.1423‚Äâ+‚Äâ2¬†T‚Äâ>‚ÄâA) in ELAC2 gene that disrupted the canonical donor splice site of intron 15 of all known isoforms. A noticeable reduction in ELAC2 expression was observed in patients compared to controls. In addition, patients exhibited significantly increased levels of 5' end unprocessed mt-RNAs compared to the control fibroblast cells.The only three previously reported families with defects in ELAC2 gene exhibited infantile hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and complex I deficiency. In contrast, our patients exhibited intellectual disability as the main feature with minimal cardiac involvement. Therefore our findings expand the phenotypic spectrum of ELAC2- associated disorders illustrating clinical heterogeneity of mutations in this gene. In addition, ELAC2 mutations should be considered when evaluating patient with mainly intellectual disability phenotypes.\n",
      "In this report we describe a moderately mentally retarded adult male with a remarkable association of additional clinical symptoms, severe hearing loss, ocular colobomata, hypogonadism of central origin, distinct craniofacial features resembling the Borjeson-Forssman-Lehmann syndrome and skeletal anomalies with cervical spina bifida, hyperkyfosis and thoracic deformity. The findings in the present patient are very similar to the observation made by Verloes et al. in two male siblings with a hitherto undescribed MCA/MR syndrome.\n",
      "A 6-month-old girl presented with an irregular nodule on the right lateral neck. The lesion, which superficially resembled a lymphangioma or mastocytoma, had been present since birth but had recently been growing. The patient was referred for surgical resection. Microscopic findings were compatible with a recently described rare hamartoma termed \"panfollicular nevus,\" which is a well-circumscribed lesion containing aberrantly differentiated, clustered hair follicles in high density.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE:To define the clinical and biochemical abnormalities of an autosomal dominant form of acute encephalopathy. METHODS:The clinical details of 11 affected family members in comparison with 63 unaffected relatives were analyzed. RESULTS:Affected children become comatose after onset of a febrile illness. Outcomes include full recovery, permanent neurologic impairment, and death. Recurrences produce more severe impairments. Lesions of necrotizing encephalopathy of the thalamus and brainstem are present on autopsy and MRI. Oxidative phosphorylation of intact mitochondria from a muscle biopsy shows loose coupling. Unaffected family members, including obligate carriers, share no clinical characteristics, demonstrating incomplete penetrance. CONCLUSIONS:Characteristic pathology and MRI findings define this disorder of autosomal dominant acute encephalopathy. Leigh syndrome and sporadic acute necrotizing encephalopathy share similarities but are distinct.\n",
      "This report deals with a family in which the maternal grandmother, the mother, and all three male children have port-wine nevi and mega cisterna magna. Two of the three male children have, in addition, congenital communicating hydrocephalus associated with agenesis of the posterior cerebellar vermis. This case of familial communicating hydrocephalus, posterior cerebellar vermis agenesis, port-wine nevus, and mega cisterna magna represents a new neurocutaneous syndrome, possibly transmitted as an autosomal dominant.\n",
      "Sensory motor neuropathy is associated with various inherited disorders including Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy/adrenomyeloneuropathy and Refsum disease. In the latter two, the neuropathy is thought to result from the accumulation of specific fatty acids. We describe here three patients with elevated plasma concentrations of pristanic acid (a branched-chain fatty acid) and C27-bile-acid intermediates. Two of the patients suffered from adult-onset sensory motor neuropathy. One patient also had pigmentary retinopathy, suggesting Refsum disease, whereas the other patient had upper motor neuron signs in the legs, suggesting adrenomyeloneuropathy. The third patient was a child without neuropathy. In all three patients we discovered a deficiency of alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR). This enzyme is responsible for the conversion of pristanoyl-CoA and C27-bile acyl-CoAs to their (S)-stereoisomers, which are the only stereoisomers that can be degraded via peroxisomal beta-oxidation. Sequence analysis of AMACR cDNA from the patients identified two different mutations that are likely to cause disease, based on analysis in Escherichia coli. Our findings have implications for the diagnosis of adult-onset neuropathies of unknown aetiology.\n",
      "A syndrome of spastic paresis, mental retardation and glaucoma has been described only once previously (Heijbel & Jagell 1981). We describe three brothers, products of a marriage between first cousins once-removed, who appear to have the same syndrome. The brothers are not dysmorphic but they have slowly progressive spastic paresis, moderate mental retardation and glaucoma with secondary cataracts. Documentation of a second consanguineous kindred with this triad of features supports the view that this is a distinct entity with an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance.\n",
      "To safeguard the cell from the accumulation of potentially harmful metabolic intermediates, specific repair mechanisms have evolved. APOA1BP, now renamed NAXE, encodes an epimerase essential in the cellular metabolite repair for NADHX and NADPHX. The enzyme catalyzes the epimerization of NAD(P)HX, thereby avoiding the accumulation of toxic metabolites. The clinical importance of the NAD(P)HX repair system has been unknown. Exome sequencing revealed pathogenic biallelic mutations in NAXE in children from four families with (sub-) acute-onset ataxia, cerebellar edema, spinal myelopathy, and skin lesions. Lactate was elevated in cerebrospinal fluid of all affected individuals. Disease onset was during the second year of life and clinical signs as well as episodes of deterioration were triggered by febrile infections. Disease course was rapidly progressive, leading to coma, global brain atrophy, and finally to death in all affected individuals. NAXE levels were undetectable in fibroblasts from affected individuals of two families. In these fibroblasts we measured highly elevated concentrations of the toxic metabolite cyclic-NADHX, confirming a deficiency of the mitochondrial NAD(P)HX repair system. Finally, NAD or nicotinic acid (vitamin B3) supplementation might have therapeutic implications for this fatal disorder.\n",
      "A previously undescribed syndrome with ventricular extrasystoles and presumed cardiac syncopy, hyperpigmentation, short stature and microcephaly in a mother and son was presented. Physiologic and pharmacologic studies suggest that the mechanism of the ventricular arrhythmia depends on multiple and reentrant pathways occurring below the bundle of His.\n",
      "Whole-exome sequencing (WES) has increasingly enabled new pathogenic gene variant identification for undiagnosed neurodevelopmental disorders and provided insights into both gene function and disease biology. Here, we describe seven children with a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by microcephaly, profound developmental delays and/or intellectual disability, cataracts, severe epilepsy including infantile spasms, irritability, failure to thrive, and stereotypic hand movements. Brain imaging in these individuals reveals delay in myelination and cerebral atrophy. We observe an identical recurrent de novo heterozygous c.892C>T (p.Arg298Trp) variant in the nucleus accumbens associated 1 (NACC1) gene in seven affected individuals. One of the seven individuals is mosaic for this variant. NACC1 encodes a transcriptional repressor implicated in gene expression and has not previously been associated with germline disorders. The probability of finding the same missense NACC1 variant by chance in 7 out of 17,228 individuals who¬†underwent WES for diagnoses of neurodevelopmental phenotypes is extremely small and achieves genome-wide significance (p¬†= 1.25¬†√ó 10-14). Selective constraint against missense variants in NACC1 makes this excess of an identical missense variant in all seven individuals more remarkable. Our findings are consistent with a germline recurrent mutational hotspot associated with an allele-specific neurodevelopmental phenotype in NACC1.\n",
      "Autosomal-dominant striatal degeneration is a rare autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative movement disorder characterized by slowly progressive parkinsonism. Recently, a mutation of the cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase 8B gene was reported to be a causal gene mutation of this disease.We report on the clinical characteristics of 2 patients of a Japanese family with autosomal-dominant striatal degeneration and the result of gene mutation analysis of this family.Clinical features of the patients are slowly progressive parkinsonism and brain MRI showing high signal intensity in T2-weighted images in the striatum. We found a heterozygous nonsense mutation in the first exon of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase 8B gene, which is predicted to disrupt all important functional domains of the cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase 8B protein.This family is the second family with autosomal-dominant striatal degeneration after the first German family, confirming that cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase 8B gene is the causative gene for this disease.\n",
      "Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare but treatable neurodegenerative disorder caused by 27-sterol hydroxylase (CYP27) deficiency.To describe clinical features and results of genetic analysis in a family with CTX.Case report.University hospital. Subjects A 54-year-old woman with CTX, her family members, and 115 white control subjects.Results of clinical evaluation and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain in the affected subject; results of mutation analysis of the CYP27 coding sequence in the patient, her parents, and the control subjects.The proband and her affected sibling had classic features of CTX, including presenile cataracts, tendon xanthomas, diarrhea, and a complex neurodegenerative disorder. They were somewhat atypical, however, because their cataracts were congenital, cognitive impairment had been noted in childhood, and the white matter involvement was more severe than usual. The proband was shown to be homozygous for CYP27 mutation R362C. Similar analysis of 115 control subjects identified 1 subject who was a heterozygous carrier for this same CYP27 mutation.The prevalence of CTX due to CYP27 mutation R362C alone is approximately 1 per 50,000 among white individuals. Although the disorder is rare, this incidence is substantially greater than previously recognized. Greater awareness of CTX is important because specific treatment is available.\n",
      "Postaxial limb deficiencies are most frequently unilateral and sporadic with deficiencies of the ulnar ray about one-third as common as those affecting the radial ray. Postaxial deficiency occurs in a number of genetic and sporadic syndromes, but isolated inherited tetramelic, postaxial oligodactyly has to our knowledge not been described. We report an affected mother and her 3 affected children from a 4-generation family with apparent autosomal dominant, non-syndromic, tetramelic, postaxial oligodactyly. The affected individuals manifest a very uniform pattern of postaxial deficiency ranging from complete absence of the 5th metacarpals, metatarsals, and phalanges to complete absence of the 5th metacarpals and metatarsals, but with some residual distal 5th phalanges. Limb buds may be considered a single developmental field with development proceeding rostral to caudal. Digit formation is apparently controlled by the zone of polarizing activity which releases a diffusible morphogen specifying positional information along the anterior/posterior axis. Recent investigations using chick and mouse embryo models suggest that 5' members of the Hox-4 gene cluster are responsible for interpreting this positional information to effect digit formation. The present family may represent a defect in Hox-4 gene patterning of hand and foot formation, an abnormality in morphogen gradient formation or alternately an inability of the most ulnar rays to respond to morphogen (receptor defect).\n",
      "We report on two siblings with a severe neonatal form of spondylometaphyseal dysplasia (SMD). Similar cases have been reported in four publications. Analysis of pedigree data from the original and present families suggests an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance, although parental gonadal mosaicism is also possible. The similarities in the phenotype between our patients and spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia congenita (SEMDC) and spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia Strudwick (SEMDS) type, indicated that these patients could have a defect in the COL2A1 gene. Molecular analysis of genomic DNA of these patients excluded this gene. Another potential candidate gene PTHR1, was also analyzed in the selected regions and no mutation was found. This gene is probably causative in the Jansen type of SMD, which shares some phenotypic features with the siblings whom we documented. Our results indicate that a new candidate gene for the reported form of SMD should be sought.\n",
      "Cobb syndrome is an exceedingly rare clinical condition defined by the presence of a vascular skin nevus and an angioma in the spinal canal at the same metamere. We report the case of a 14-year-old boy who presented with sudden onset paraplegia. Physical examination showed port-wine stains over buttock and thigh. Magnetic resonance (MR) angiogram of the dorso-lumbar spine revealed a large arteriovenous malformation (AVM) at D11-D12 to L2-L3 levels. These concurrent findings led to the diagnosis of Cobb's syndrome. The patient received orally administered prednisolone therapy and underwent endovascular embolization of spinal angioma. Cobb's syndrome is a rare disease entity and literature search revealed only a few case reports and series mentioning this condition to date. The importance lies in the recognition that cutaneous vascular lesions may clue to an associated spinal cord angioma or AVM that may lead to weakness or paralysis.\n",
      "We report on a new syndrome characterized by specific and striking facial abnormalities, arthrogrypotic skeletal deformities, and neuromuscular and sensory defects in a large Greek Cypriot family. The hereditary transmission appears to be autosomal dominant with quite variable expressivity.\n",
      "Blepharo-naso-facial syndrome, described by Pashayan et al. (10), is characterized by telecanthus, lateral displacement and stenosis of lacrimal puncta, bulky nose, mask-like facies, trapezo√Ødal upper lip, torsion dystonia and mental retardation. We report on a family with this rare malformation syndrome, confirming the existence of this syndrome and its dominant inheritance. The proband had a fleshy nose, a prominant nose bridge, an hypoplastic midface, telecanthus with temporal displacement of puncta, lacrimal excretory obstruction. CNS torsion dystonia, increased deep tendon reflexes, Babinski reflexes, poor coordination and joint laxity. The proband's mother, brother and maternal grandfather also showed manifestations of the syndrome. The proband and his brother had delayed developmental milestones. Hearing impairment was present in the proband, his mother and his grandfather but was absent in the proband's brother. The blepharonasofacial syndrome was described by Pashayan et al. (10) in four members of one family, two male and one female sib and their mother. Two other sibs were unaffected. Many of the features of the blepharo-facio-nasal syndrome also occur in other well known syndromes i.e. Waardenburg syndrome. The pedigrees of the family of Pashayan et al. (10) and of our family are compatible with Mendelian dominant inheritance, either autosomal or X-linked. X-linked dominant inheritance cannot be ruled out except by male-to-male transmission, which does not occur in these families. Pashayan et al. (10) suggested that an autosomal gene with variable expressivity appears more likely. More families are needed for defining the transmission of the condition and for mapping the gene involved in the blepharo-naso-facial syndrome.\n",
      "OBJECT:Cowden disease is a rare autosomal-dominant phacomatosis and cancer syndrome that is associated with Lhermitte-Duclos disease (LDD), also called dysplastic cerebellar gangliocytoma. METHODS:In this review the authors summarize the additions to the literature during the past 5 years, with emphasis on new case reports and advances in imaging and molecular biology. Adult-onset LDD is now considered pathognomonic for Cowden disease. Approximately 220 cases of LDD have been reported. Magnetic resonance imaging in patients with LDD is often diagnostic, and imaging studies have facilitated accurate diagnosis and contributed to the improved outcome in affected patients. Cowden disease and other rare, related disorders, such as Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba, Proteus, and Proteus- like syndromes, are often caused by mutations of the PTEN gene. CONCLUSIONS:Because of the high incidence of systemic cancer in patients with Cowden disease, it is important for neurosurgeons to recognize the association between this disease and LDD and to refer affected patients for appropriate cancer screenings and interventions.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV) is a rare genodermatosis associated with infections with specific human papillomaviruses (HPVs) belonging to the beta genus of HPV. Patients with EV usually have a selective defect in cell-mediated immunity. Although skin cancer frequently develops in the sun-exposed cutaneous lesions of patients with EV, the anogenital area is usually not affected by squamous cell carcinomas related to mucosal HPV types. OBSERVATIONS: We report the case of a patient with clinical similarities to EV who also presented with primary lymphedema, anogenital dysplasias, and depressed cell-mediated immunity. Swab samples and biopsy specimens from various body sites collected over a 28-month period were screened by different protocols for DNA of the HPV groups alpha, beta, and mu/nu. Seventeen alpha-HPV types could be demonstrated. Interestingly, beta-HPVs (HPV-22 and HPV-23) were detectable only in plucked eyebrows and in 1 skin swab sample. None of the specimens from lesional biopsies carried beta-HPV. Consistently found alpha-HPV types included HPV types 6, 51, 52, 61, and 84 in the genitoanal region and HPV-57 in skin lesions. Histological and cytological evaluation revealed multifocal anogenital dysplasia and benign genital and cutaneous warts. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, only 1 other similar case of an EV-like syndrome with impaired, cell-mediated immunity and primary lymphedema has been described in the literature. Based on the characteristic clinical and virological findings in the present case and the previously published case, we speculate that both patients could have a previously unknown syndrome that has clinical similarities to EV but notably differs in the associated HPV types. We suggest the acronym WILD (warts, immunodeficiency, lymphedema, dysplasia) to characterize this syndrome.\n",
      "BACKGROUND/AIMS:Insulin resistance is associated with a number genetic syndromes and a variety of defects of insulin action. METHODS:We describe three members of an extended family spanning two generations with insulin resistance Type A and short 5th metacarpals. The proband had secondary amenorrhoea, male pattern hair distribution, acne, hirsutism, deep voice, acanthosis nigricans, polycystic ovaries, diabetes, features of acromegaly, raised creatine kinase and triglyceride levels and short 5th metacarpals. Her growth hormone, adrenal steroid and testosterone levels were normal. The proband's daughter had severe acne, hirsutism, acanthosis nigricans, polycystic ovaries, raised triglyceride, glucose and testosterone level short metacarpals and normal insulin receptor gene. The proband's son had a muscular build, raised creatine kinase, hypertriglyceridaemia and short 5th metacarpals. His fasting insulin levels were normal but pro-insulin was raised. RESULT/CONCLUSION:There are many familial and genetic syndromes associated with insulin resistance. This family was diagnosed as having insulin resistance Type A. This family does not conform entirely to any of the previously described syndromes and a number of family members have the phenotype of short 5th metacarpals, which appears to be associated with the features of insulin resistance Type A.\n",
      "We present a case with spondylo-metaphyseal dysplasia type A4 characterized by ovoid vertebral bodies with anterior tongue-like deformities, widened irregular and sclerotic metaphyseal changes, short iliac wings, slightly short long bones and short tubular bones of the hands with irregular metaphyses. She also had bipartite trochlea and irregular patellar margins, which have not been described in spondylo-metaphyseal dysplasia types to date.\n",
      "OBJECTIVES: Juvenile localized scleroderma (JLS) usually has its onset during later childhood. This report describes the clinical and serologic features of six children with congenital localized scleroderma (CLS). STUDY DESIGN: A large, multinational study was conducted among pediatric rheumatology and dermatology centers by collecting information on demographics, family history, triggering environmental factors, clinical features, laboratory reports, and treatment of patients with JLS. Patients with onset at birth were carefully examined. RESULTS: Among 750 patients with JLS, 6 patients (0.8%) had scleroderma-related lesions at birth. Female-to-male ratio was 2:1. All patients had linear scleroderma, in four involving the face with en coup de sabre appearance. Two patients were misdiagnosed as having skin infection, one nevus, one salmon patch, and two undefined skin lesions. The mean diagnostic delay was 3.9 years. In comparison with the group of 733 patients with late-onset JLS, CLS presented a significantly more prolonged disease duration at diagnosis and a higher frequency of en coup de sabre subtypes. CONCLUSIONS: Congenital localized scleroderma is a rare and probably underestimated condition in neonates. The linear subtype was the exclusive manifestation of the disease. CLS should be included in the differential diagnosis of infants with cutaneous erythematous fibrotic lesions to avoid functional and aesthetic sequelae and to allow prompt therapy.\n",
      "A 24-year-old woman who had sinus histiocytosis with massive lymphadenopathy (SHML, Rosai-Dorfman disease) also had oligoarthritis. We found only four previously reported cases of SHML with clinical joint disease. The clinical picture may suggest rheumatoid arthritis or a spondylarthropathy with peripheral joint involvement. SHML should be considered routinely among the differential diagnoses in young patients with arthritis and large lymphadenopathies. There is no consensus regarding the treatment. In our patient, conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs followed by 3 months of adalimumab then 3 months of etanercept had no effect on the symptoms.\n",
      "We report two sibs with the Smith-Lemli-Opitz (RSH) syndrome and intelligence in the borderline normal range. The proposita has all the features of the syndrome; however, her brother shows fewer signs, indicating that considerable variability of expression may exist for this autosomal recessive trait. Nearly all previous cases had severe to profound mental retardation. The incidence of the syndrome in British Columbia is approximately 1/40,000 live births, giving a heterozygote frequency of about 1/100.\n",
      "Cutaneous collagenous vasculopathy is characterized by generalized cutaneous telangiectasia and unique microscopic and ultrastructural vascular changes, consisting of marked collagen deposition within the vascular walls of the post-capillary venules in the superficial dermis. There are only 4 previous cases described in the medical literature, all in males, mostly middle-aged. We have recently seen two female patients with clinical and histopathologic features diagnostic of cutaneous collagenous vasculopathy, indicating that it is not restricted to males. As cutaneous collagenous vasculopathy can be clinically indistinguishable from generalized essential telangiectasia, and histopathologic studies are rarely performed for this condition, it is likely that cutaneous collagenous vasculopathy frequently passes unrecognized, but it may be more common than previously thought.\n",
      "We report on a 5-year-old boy with moderate mental retardation, horseshoe kidneys, tricuspid valve prolapse, and a characteristic face with broad nasal root, prominent ears, and a cleft palate. These manifestations suggested the diagnosis of the Eastman-Bixler syndrome. Our patient also had an isolated growth hormone deficiency which responded successfully to treatment.\n",
      "Cataract is a major cause of severe visual impairment in childhood. The purpose of this study was to determine the genetic cause of syndromic congenital cataract in an Australian mother and son.Fifty-one genes associated with congenital cataract were sequenced in the proband using a custom Ampliseq library on the Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine (PGM). Reads were aligned against the human genome (hg19) and variants were annotated. Variants were prioritised for validation by Sanger sequencing if they were novel, rare or previously reported to be associated with paediatric cataract and were predicted to be protein changing. Variants were assessed for segregation with the phenotype in the affected mother.A novel likely pathogenic variant was identified in the transactivation domain of the MAF gene (c.176C‚Äâ>‚ÄâG, p.(Pro59Arg)) in the proband and his affected mother., but was absent in 326 unrelated controls and absent from public variant databases.The MAF variant is the likely cause of the congenital cataract, Asperger syndrome, seizures, hearing loss and facial characteristics in the proband, providinga diagnosis of Aym√©-Gripp syndrome for the family.\n",
      "We report on a newborn girl with microcephaly, abnormal brain development, optic atrophy and hypoplasia, persistent lactic acidemia, and a mildly elevated plasma concentration of very-long-chain fatty acids. We found a defect of the fission of both mitochondria and peroxisomes, as well as a heterozygous, dominant-negative mutation in the dynamin-like protein 1 gene (DLP1). The DLP1 protein has previously been implicated, in vitro, in the fission of both these organelles. Overexpression of the mutant DLP1 in control cells reproduced the fission defect. Our findings are representative of a class of disease characterized by defects in both mitochondria and peroxisomes.\n",
      "Two sibs from one Lebanese family presented with congenital hearing loss, meatal atresia, preauricular tags and pits, branchial cysts or fistulae, strabismus, difficulty in opening the mouth wide enough, abnormal fifth fingers, somewhat short stature, and learning disability and patchy skin depigmentation in one. Temporal bone abnormalities identified on computed tomography included atresia of the external auditory canal with reduction in size of the middle ear, malformed ossicles, and unilateral internal auditory canal hypoplasia. Hand radiographs showed pointed phalanges of the 5th fingers with osseous erosions. Their father, his sister, and his half-brother had unilateral auricular pits and/or branchial cysts. Results of all laboratory investigations including sequencing of the EYA1 gene were normal. Differential diagnosis is discussed and the possibility of the report of a new autosomal dominant type of branchiogenic-deafness syndrome with variable expressivity is raised.\n",
      "Recently we reported two sibs, brother and sister, with a new multiple congenital anomalies/mental retardation (MCA/MR) syndrome characterized by mild to moderate psychomotor delay, Robin sequence, distinctive facial appearance, and brachydactyly. We have subsequently observed a similar pattern of anomalies in two unrelated patients who also showed additional clinical findings. This new observation supports the existence of a new syndrome and expands the phenotypic spectrum of the condition.\n",
      "We report a mother and daughter with a syndrome of hypotrichosis, striate palmoplantar keratoderma, onychogryphosis, periodontitis, acro-osteolysis and psoriasis-like skin lesions. The syndrome resembles Papillon-Lef√É¬®vre syndrome (PLS), characterized by palmoplantar keratoderma, periodontitis and psoriasis-like skin lesions, and particularly Haim-Munk syndrome, an allelic variant of PLS with acro-osteolysis. Both are caused by mutations in the cathepsin C gene (CTSC). Our patients differ in the unique nature of the palmar keratoderma and hypotrichosis. We have sequenced CTSC in the mother without finding mutations in either coding or non-coding parts of the gene. We propose that our patients suffer from a new syndrome possibly caused by mutations in a gene that has a functional or structural relation with CTSC.\n",
      "Rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata (RCDP) is a group of disorders with overlapping clinical features including rhizomelia, chondrodysplasia punctata, coronal clefts, cervical dysplasia, congenital cataracts, profound postnatal growth retardation, severe intellectual disability, and seizures. Mutations in PEX7, GNPAT, and AGPS, all involved in the plasmalogen-biosynthesis pathway, have been described in individuals with RCDP. Here, we report the identification of mutations in another gene in plasmalogen biosynthesis, fatty acyl-CoA reductase 1 (FAR1), in two families affected by severe intellectual disability, early-onset epilepsy, microcephaly, congenital cataracts, growth retardation, and spasticity. Exome analyses revealed a homozygous in-frame indel mutation (c.495_507delinsT [p.Glu165_Pro169delinsAsp]) in two siblings from a consanguineous family and compound-heterozygous mutations (c.[787C>T];[1094A>G], p.[Arg263(‚àó)];[Asp365Gly]) in a third unrelated individual. FAR1 reduces fatty acids to their respective fatty alcohols for the plasmalogen-biosynthesis pathway. To assess the pathogenicity of the identified mutations, we transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells with plasmids encoding FAR1 with either wild-type or mutated constructs and extracted the lipids from the cells. We screened the lipids with gas chromatography and mass spectrometry and found that all three mutations abolished the reductase activity of FAR1, given that no fatty alcohols could be detected. We also observed reduced plasmalogens in red blood cells in one individual to a range similar to that seen in individuals with RCDP, further supporting abolished FAR1 activity. We thus expand the spectrum of clinical features associated with defects in plasmalogen biosynthesis to include FAR1 deficiency as a cause of syndromic severe intellectual disability with cataracts, epilepsy, and growth retardation but without rhizomelia.\n",
      "Two still-born males whose mothers were sisters are presented. The features holoprosencephaly, hypokinesia, microcephaly, talipes, and other contractures correspond to those in the two male sibs reported by Morse et al. (1987). We suggest that our cases now provide evidence of an X-linked rather than an autosomal recessive new syndrome.\n",
      "A 27-year-old woman of Moldavian origin presented at the age of 15 with progressive proximal limb weakness and painful cramps in her calf muscles. Clinical examination revealed prominent muscle weakness in proximal muscles of the lower extremities and distal anterior compartment of legs, and mild weakness in shoulder girdle muscles. In addition, she had marked calf hypertrophy, muscle atrophy involving the anterior and posterior compartments of the thighs, and the distal anterior compartment of legs, as well as mild scapular winging and hyperlordosis. A muscle biopsy taken from the biceps brachii showed mild dystrophic changes, absent vacuoles, and abundant lobulated fibers. Immunofluorescence and Western blot assays demonstrated complete telethonin deficiency. Molecular analysis revealed a homozygous Trp25X mutation in the telethonin (TCAP) gene resulting in termination of transcription at an early point. Four families from Brazil with telethonin deficiency have previously been reported and classified as LGMD2G, but the actual frequency of this disease is unknown. With this current identification of a case outside the Brazilian population, telethonin mutation-associated LGMD should be considered worldwide.\n",
      "Aminoacylase 1 deficiency (ACY1D) is a rare inborn error of metabolism characterized by increased urinary excretion of N-acetylated amino acids. Clinical phenotypes of 15 known patients with ACY1 deficiency have been described up to now. Findings are greatly variable, ranging from normality to relevant neurological and psychiatric impairments, but clinical follow up has been rarely reported. To partially fill this gap, we present a detailed clinical description and the outcome four years post-diagnosis of a patient already described, with mild intellectual disability, language delay, autistic traits and compound heterozygous mutations in ACY1.\n",
      "Heterozygous BICD2 gene mutations cause a form of autosomal dominant spinal muscular atrophy with lower extremity predominance (SMALED).We analyzed the BICD2 gene in a selected group of 25 index patients with neurogenic muscle atrophy.We identified 2 new BICD2 missense mutations, c.2515G>A, p.Gly839Arg, in a family with autosomal dominant inheritance, and c.2202G>T, p.Lys734Asn, as a de novo mutation in an isolated patient with similar phenotype. The patients had congenital foot contractures, muscle atrophy of the legs, and slowly progressive weakness of the shoulder girdle. There was no apparent sensory or brain dysfunction. One patient died of unrelated reasons at age 52 years. Autopsy revealed no upper motor neuron and only moderate lower motor neuron loss, but there was distal corticospinal tract degeneration and marked neurogenic muscular atrophy.These findings give further insight into the clinical and pathoanatomical consequences of BICD2 mutations.

      "We describe a 19-year-old male with a previously unrecognized form of disproportionate short stature, tracheobronchial malacia, and progressive scoliosis and his 28-year-old sister with the same but milder condition. The clinical characteristics were short limbs and digits and thoracolumbar scoliosis. Bone films showed progression from marked metaphyseal dysplasia of tubular bones in childhood to short and broad bones with mild dysplasia of the joints in adulthood. The vertebrae and the intervertebral plates were only mildly affected in spite of marked scoliosis. Trachea and bronchi were reinforced with surrounding acrylate mesh before surgical treatment of the scoliosis. Affected sibs of both sexes and healthy parents suggest an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance.\n",
      "We present three sibs with similar dysmorphic features, including brain, heart and lung malformations that have not been reported previously. Cytogenetic studies have failed to demonstrate a chromosomal abnormality. Although parental consanguinity was not present, we suggest that this may constitute a new recessive syndrome.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Borjeson-Forssman-Lehmann syndrome (BFLS) is an X-linked recessive intellectual disability (ID) disorder caused by mutations in the PHF6 gene and characterised by variable cognitive impairment, a distinct facial gestalt, obesity, and hypogonadism. Female carriers are usually not affected or only mildly affected, and so far only two females with de novo mutations or deletions in PHF6 have been reported. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed PHF6 mutational analysis and screening for intragenic deletions and duplications by quantitative real-time PCR and multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification (MLPA) in female patients with variable ID and a distinct appearance of sparse hair, remarkable facial features, hypoplastic nails, and teeth anomalies. We detected two truncating mutations and two duplications of exons 4 and 5. Furthermore, two female patients with PHF6 deletions and a similar phenotype were identified by routine molecular karyotyping. Recently, two patients with a clinical diagnosis of Coffin-Siris syndrome in early infancy had been found to harbour mutations in PHF6, and their phenotype in advanced ages is now described. Further studies revealed skewed X-inactivation in blood lymphocytes, while it was normal in fibroblasts, thus indicating functional mosaicism. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that de novo defects in PHF6 in females result in a recognisable phenotype which might have been under-recognised so far and which comprises variable ID, a characteristic facial gestalt, hypoplastic nails, brachydactyly, clinodactyly mainly of fingers IV and V, dental anomalies, and linear skin hyperpigmentation. It shows overlap with BFLS but also additional distinct features, thus adding a new facet to this disorder.\n",
      "We describe two brothers with sensorineural deafness, diabetes mellitus, progressive neurological deterioration with photomyoclonic epilepsy, and progressive deterioration in renal function, resulting in death in the third decade of life. Autopsy showed diffuse atherosclerosis and arteriolosclerosis of the systemic vasculature. There was no evidence of these abnormalities in the patients' 2 sisters or either parent. Mitochondrial enzyme analysis documented partial deficiencies of Complex III and IV of the respiratory chain. This deficiency was expressed in skin fibroblasts, kidney and liver but not in muscle. This suggests that the disease-causing mutation is either in the mitochondrial or nuclear DNA. Various modes of inheritance are considered, including maternal, autosomal recessive, or X-linked recessive. We suggest this is a new genetic syndrome characterized by an underlying metabolic disease and premature atherosclerosis, possibly of mitochondrial origin.\n",
      "The association of upper limb malformations and congenital cardiac anomalies was established as a definite clinical and genetic entity by Holt & Oram in 1960. Significant variability of malformations in both the upper limbs and the cardiovascular system has been well documented. In 1978, Temtamy & McKusick reported a family studied by Tabatznik, in which upper limb deformities, including type D brachydactyly, occurred in association with cardiac arrhythmias as a dominant, either autosomal or X-linked trait. They called this apparently new entity \"Heart-Hand syndrome II\" to distinguish it from the Holt-Oram syndrome. No other similar cases have subsequently been reported. We describe here the second family affected with the Tabatznik syndrome and add some new findings to the clinical spectrum of this condition.\n",
      "AIM:Non-progressive ataxias with cerebellar hypoplasia are a rarely seen heterogeneous group of hereditary cerebellar ataxias. METHOD:Three sib pairs from three different families with this entity have been reviewed, and differential diagnosis has been discussed. RESULTS:In two of the families, the parents were consanguineous. Walking was delayed in all the children. Truncal and extremity ataxia were then noticed. Ataxia was severe in one child, moderate in two children, and mild in the remaining three. Neurological examination revealed horizontal, horizonto-rotatory and/or vertical nystagmus, variable degrees of mental retardation, and pyramidal signs besides truncal and extremity ataxia. In all the cases, cerebellar hemisphere and vermis hypoplasia were detected in MRI. During the follow-up period, a gradual clinical improvement was achieved in all the children. CONCLUSION:Inheritance should be considered as autosomal recessive in some of the non-progressive ataxic syndromes. Congenital non-progressive ataxias are still being investigated due to the rarity of large pedigrees for genetic studies. If further information on the aetiopathogenesis and clinical progression of childhood ataxias associated with cerebellar hypoplasia is to be acquired, a combined evaluation of metabolic screening, long-term follow-up and radiological analyses is essential.\n",
      "The aim of this study is to characterize the in utero presentation of the subtype of double-inlet left ventricle (DILV), a rare congenital heart disease, and assess the postnatal outcome. We retrospectively studied fetuses diagnosed prenatally with DILV between 2007 and 2011. We reviewed the prenatal and postnatal echocardiograms, clinical presentations, karyotypes, and the postnatal outcomes. There were eight fetuses diagnosed with DILV with L-transposition of the great vessels (S, L, L). Mean gestational age at diagnosis was 24.7 weeks. Of these, four fetuses (50%) had pulmonary atresia. One fetus (12.5%) also had tricuspid atresia and coarctation of the aorta and died at 17 months of age. Complete heart block and long QT syndrome was present in one fetus (12.5%), who died shortly after birth. There were no extracardiac or karyotypic abnormalities. Six (75%) infants are alive and doing well. Double-inlet left ventricle with varied presentation can be accurately diagnosed prenatally. The outcome of fetuses is good in the absence of associated rhythm abnormalities with surgically staged procedures leading to a Fontan circulation.\n",
      "Interstitial deletions of 6q are rare. We report a detailed clinical and molecular characterization of four patients with interstitial deletion involving 6q25. All of our patients presented with microcephaly, developmental delay, dysmorphic features and hearing loss, whereas two of them had agenesis of the corpus callosum. We determined the size, extent and genomic content of the deletions using high-density array-comparative genomic hybridization (a-CGH), and found that a common segment spanning 3.52 Mb within the 6q25.2-q25.3 region was deleted in all four cases. We hypothesize that a subset of genes in the commonly deleted region are dosage sensitive and that haploinsufficieny of these genes impairs normal development of the brain and hearing.\n",
      "Complete, isolated trisomy of the short arm of chromosome 18 is very rare. To date, only 24 cases of trisomy 18p have been reported in the literature, making it difficult to define a potentially associated phenotype. However, the available evidence suggests that few clinical features are shared by these patients: only variable intellectual disability, variable facial dysmorphism and epilepsy are reported in a few patients. Although three inherited cases of trisomy 18p have already been reported, all were of maternal origin. We report on a patient carrying an isolated complete trisomy 18p translocated to the short arm of chromosome 14 and presenting with facial dysmorphism, mild intellectual disability and non-obstructive azoospermia. Chromosomal abnormalities are more frequent in infertile men with poor sperm quality than the general population. Both numerical and structural chromosomal aberrations have been already reported within the context of azoospermia. To our knowledge, this is the first patient with trisomy 18p to present a fertility impairment due to totally altered spermatogenesis and azoospermia. Although fertility disorders were not mentioned in the four previous reports of men with trisomy 18p, none of the latter had children. We suggest that azoospermia is a previously uncharacterized feature of trisomy 18p syndrome. We further hypothesize that two mechanisms could be responsible of the fertility impairment: a meiotic synapsis defect due to the additional 18p arm that blocks meiosis, and/or overexpression of a gene located on the 18p chromosome involved in the normal testicular development.\n",
      "Weill-Marchesani syndrome (WMS) is a rare connective tissue disorder, characterized by short stature, microspherophakic lens, and stubby hands and feet (brachydactyly). WMS is caused by mutations in the FBN1, ADAMTS10, and LTBP2 genes. Mutations in the LTBP2 and ADAMTS17 genes cause a WMS-like syndrome, in which the affected individuals show major features of WMS but do not display brachydactyly and joint stiffness. The main purpose of our study was to determine the genetic cause of WMS in an Indian family.Whole exome sequencing (WES) was used to identify the genetic cause of WMS in the family. The cosegregation of the mutation was determined with Sanger sequencing. Reverse transcription (RT)-PCR analysis was used to assess the effect of a splice-site mutation on splicing of the ADAMTS17 transcript.The WES analysis identified a homozygous novel splice-site mutation c.873+1G>T in a known WMS-like syndrome gene, ADAMTS17, in the family. RT-PCR analysis in the patient showed that exon 5 was skipped, which resulted in the deletion of 28 amino acids in the ADAMTS17 protein.The mutation in the WMS-like syndrome gene ADAMTS17 also causes WMS in an Indian family. The present study will be helpful in genetic diagnosis of this family and increases the number of mutations of this gene to six.\n",
      "Hirschsprung's disease usually occurs as an isolated malformation as a result of multifactorial causation. A family in which four males (two brothers and two maternal uncles) had Hirschsprung's disease and absence or hypoplasia of the nails and distal phalanges of the great toe and thumb (type D brachydactyly) is described. Hand abnormalities were not present in any other family members, and the obligate heterozygous females were without gastrointestinal problems. The pattern of inheritance was consistent with X-linked recessive inheritance; however, autosomal dominant inheritance with incomplete penetrance in females or multifactorial causation could not be completely excluded.\n",
      "Hyper-beta-alaninemia was found in a somnolent, convulsing infant. Hyper-beta-aminoaciduria (beta-ala, betaAIB and taurine) was also observed, varying directly with plasma beta-alanine concentration. The beta-aminoaciduria is explained by the interaction between beta-alanine and a specific cellular-transport system with preference for beta-amino compounds. Gamma-aminobutyricaciduria was also observed, its excretion being independent of beta-alanine levels. Dietary modifications, pyridoxine, pantothenic acid and antibiotic therapy were not beneficial. Post-mortem tissues had elevated levels of beta-alanine and carnosine; GABA levels in brain were probably elevated for the age of the patient. A proposed block in beta-alanine-alpha-ketoglutarate transaminase would expand the free beta-alanine pool, thus increasing tissue carnosine. beta-Alanine is a central-nervous-system depressant. Associated inhibition of GABA transaminase and displacement of GABA from central-nervous-system binding sites would produce GABAuria and convulsions.\n",
      "Three brothers had a syndrome of hypospadias and mental retardation in association with microcephaly, craniofacial dysmorphism, joint laxity, and beaked nails. No other family members were affected, and this previously undelineated condition appears to be inherited in either an autosomal recessive or X-linked recessive mode.\n",
      "A young girl 12 old, sent to us for obesity, and coxa-epiphysiolysis showed signs of mental retardation and bilateral thumb ankylosis. The fact that the mother was also affected by both of these signs, led to a more detailed genetic research. The latter revealed that not only the daughter, the mother, but also their own mother and may be, the sister, the grand-mother and the great-aunt of the patient had a retardation, a slight dysmorphia, a type A brachydactylia, signs of obesity and an identical ankylosis of both thumbs. This vertical inheritance, affecting apparently females only, but not associated with a high rate of miscarriage, has, it seems, never been reported. The characteristics of this family are being considered and discussed.\n",
      "We report here on a 25-year follow-up of cranio-meta-diaphyseal dysplasia in a 31-year-old Caucasian male, who was reported in the literature at the age of 8 years [Langer et al. (1991); Skeletal Radiol 20:37-41]. He has hyperostotic craniofacial features with protruding lower jaw and midface hypoplasia. He has the typical radiographic features of wide long tubular bones without normal metaphyseal flaring and wide short tubular bones without normal diaphyseal constriction. We describe here his clinical and radiological findings and compare his case with those published in the literature. He is the oldest reported patient with this disorder giving some insight into the natural history of this rare skeletal dysplasia.\n",
      "The location and/or type of variants in FLNB result in a spectrum of osteochondrodysplasias ranging from mild forms, like spondylocarpotarsal synostosis syndrome and Larsen syndrome, to severe perinatal lethal forms, such as atelosteogenesis I and III and Boomerang dysplasia. Spondylocarpotarsal synostosis syndrome is characterized by disproportionate short stature, vertebral anomalies and fusion of carpal and tarsal bones. Biallelic loss-of-function variants in FLNB are known to cause spondylocarpotarsal synostosis syndrome and 9 families and 9 pathogenic variants have been reported so far. We report clinical features of 10 additional patients from 7 families with spondylocarpotarsal synostosis syndrome due to 7 novel deleterious variants in FLNB, thus expanding the clinical and molecular repertoire of spondylocarpotarsal synostosis syndrome. Our report validates key clinical (fused thoracic vertebrae and carpal and tarsal coalition) and molecular (truncating variants in FLNB) characteristics of this condition.\n",
      "The conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex is a heterooctameric complex that regulates intraGolgi trafficking and the integrity of the Golgi compartment in eukaryotic cells. Here, we describe a patient with a mild form of congenital disorder of glycosylation type II (CDG-II) that is caused by a deficiency in the Cog1 subunit of the complex. This patient has a defect in both N- and O-glycosylation. Mass spectrometric analysis of the structures of the N-linked glycans released from glycoproteins from the patient's serum revealed a reduction in sialic acid and galactose residues. Peanut agglutinin (PNA) lectin staining revealed a decrease in sialic acids on core 1 mucin type O-glycans, indicating a combined defect in N- and O-glycosylation. Sequence analysis of the COG1 cDNA and gene identified a homozygous insertion of a single nucleotide (2659-2660insC), which is predicted to lead to a premature translation stop and truncation of the C terminus of the Cog1 protein by 80 amino acids. This mutation destabilizes several other COG subunits and alters their subcellular localization and hence the overall integrity of the COG complex. This results in reduced levels and/or altered Golgi localization of alpha-mannosidase II and beta-1,4 galactosyltransferase I, which links it to the glycosylation deficiency. Transfection of primary fibroblasts of this patient with the full length hemagglutinin-tagged Cog1 indeed restored beta-1,4 galactosyltransferase Golgi localization. We propose naming this disorder CDG-II/Cog1, or CDG-II caused by Cog1 deficiency.\n",
      "We describe two siblings born to consanguineous Arab-Muslim parents who presented in early√Ç¬†infancy with myoclonic seizures, hypertonia and contractures, arrested head growth, inability to swallow, and bouts of apnea-bradycardia, culminating in cardiac arrest and death. Whole-genome sequencing yielded a c.1173delG mutation in the BRAT1 gene. Three recent reports identified mutations in the same gene in three infants from three Amish sibships, one Mexican neonate and two Japanese siblings with similar clinical manifestations. The authors speculated that the destabilization of the encoded protein may underlie the catastrophic epilepsy and corticobasal neuronal degeneration. We suggest that BRAT1 be added to the growing list of genes that are related to severe early infantile (neonatal) epileptic encephalopathy.\n",
      "Despite considerable progress in identifying causal genes for lipodystrophy syndromes, the molecular basis of some peculiar adipose tissue disorders remains obscure. In an Israeli-Arab pedigree with a novel autosomal recessive, multiple symmetric lipomatosis (MSL), partial lipodystrophy and myopathy, we conducted exome sequencing of two affected siblings to identify the disease-causing mutation. The 41-year-old female proband and her 36-year-old brother reported marked accumulation of subcutaneous fat in the face, neck, axillae, and trunk but loss of subcutaneous fat from the lower extremities and progressive distal symmetric myopathy during adulthood. They had increased serum creatine kinase levels, hypertriglyceridemia and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Exome sequencing identified a novel homozygous NC_000019.9:g.42906092C>A variant on chromosome 19, leading to a NM_005357.3:c.3103G>T nucleotide change in coding DNA and corresponding p.(Glu1035*) protein change in hormone sensitive lipase (LIPE) gene as the disease-causing variant. Sanger sequencing further confirmed the segregation of the mutation in the family. Hormone sensitive lipase is the predominant regulator of lipolysis from adipocytes, releasing free fatty acids from stored triglycerides. The homozygous null LIPE mutation could result in marked inhibition of lipolysis from some adipose tissue depots and thus may induce an extremely rare phenotype of MSL and partial lipodystrophy in adulthood associated with complications of insulin resistance, such as diabetes, hypertriglyceridemia and hepatic steatosis. √Ç¬© 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\n",
      "We present a so far unrecognized X-linked mental retardation syndrome with features overlapping with Joubert syndrome (JBS). Two brothers showed hypotonia, mental retardation, ocular abnormalities with impaired vision and colobomas and a breathing pattern compatible with JBS. Neuroimaging revealed cerebellar vermis hypoplasia and ventriculomegaly. A tentative diagnosis of JBS was made, and autosomal recessive inheritance considered most likely. In a subsequent pregnancy that occurred after artificial donor insemination, ultrasound in the 22nd week revealed a Dandy-Walker malformation and hydrocephaly. At autopsy at 34 weeks of gestation, the male infant showed cerebellar vermis aplasia and abnormalities of the brainstem and cerebral cortex. He was considered to have the same disorder as his two half-brothers. This renders the pedigree highly suggestive of X-linked inheritance. The clinical symptoms of this syndrome resemble JBS. However, the absence of the molar tooth sign and the X-linked inheritance do not support JBS. We propose the name X-linked cerebral-cerebellar-coloboma syndrome to distinguish the two disorders. Differentiation of the two disorders is especially important in genetic counseling, where artificial donor insemination may be considered as a means of reducing the recurrence risk, or when female relatives of the patient are concerned.\n",
      "We report a large kindred in which individuals presented with fixation of the scapula to the first rib by a congenitally short costocoracoid ligament. Cosmetic deformity with rounding of the shoulder and loss of the anterior clavicular contour was the main concern of the affected individuals. Movements requiring rotation or retraction of the scapula were limited, although this did not interfere with normal activities. Surgical treatment consists of excision of the costocoracoid ligament and resulted in some correction of the cosmetic deformity. The pedigree supports an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance with variable expression. The abnormality results in a pectoral girdle which is reminiscent of that seen in the monotremes.\n",
      "The focal facial dermal dysplasias (FFDDs) are a group of inherited disorders of facial development, characterised by bitemporal or preauricular scar-like defects, the former resembling 'forceps marks'. Recently, different homozygous TWIST2 nonsense mutations were reported in unrelated Setleis syndrome (FFDD Type III) patients from consanguineous families, consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance. Mexican-Nahua sibs with facial and ophthalmologic features of FFDD type III were evaluated.Genomic DNAs were isolated for sequencing of the TWIST2 gene. The clinical features and inheritance of all previously reported FFDD patients were reviewed.The affected sibs were homozygous for a novel TWIST2 frameshift mutation, c.168delC (p.S57AfsX45). Notably, both parents and two heterozygous sibs had distichiasis and partial absence of lower eyelashes. The FFDD subtypes were reclassified: the 'Brauer-Setleis' phenotype (autosomal dominant with variable expressivity) as FFDD type II; and patients with preauricular lesions as a new subtype, FFDD type IV.FFDD type III heterozygotes with TWIST2 mutations may have syndromic manifestations. Review of previous FFDD patients resulted in reclassification of the subtypes.\n",
      "Two brothers with upper limb and renal anomalies have been identified. Their upper limb abnormalities were characterized by absence and hypoplasia of various bones; their renal anomalies included crossed-fused ectopia and vesico-ureteral reflux. Both suffered from chronic kidney failure secondary to reflux nephropathy. An autosomal or sex-linked mode of inheritance seems likely.\n",
      "To summarize and report the clinical characteristics and laboratory results of a case and those reported in literature with MHC class ‚Ö° deficiency.The clinical features, laboratory results and gene mutation analysis of an infant with MHC class ‚Ö° deficiency, who was diagnosed and treated in Peking Union Medical College Hospital since December 2013, were retrospectively analyzed.\"Major histocompatibility complex class ‚Ö° deficiency\"or\"bare lymphocyte syndrome\"were used as keywords in order to retrieve reports from CNKI (from its establishment to October 2015) and Wanfang Database (from its establishment to October 2015), PubMed Database (from its establishment to October 2015) was searched. The characteristics, diagnosis, treatment and prognosis were summarized by reviewing related articles.The patient was a 8-month-old boy. Since the fourth month of life, he started to have repeated fever, susceptible to a variety of pathogens, immune hemolytic anemia, severe malnutrition, and finally diagnosed as MHC class ‚Ö° deficiency disease when he was 20-month-old.No related reports were retrieved from CNKI and Wanfang database, there were 20 articles and 179 patients were reported worldwide in the past 10 years. Patients exhibit an extreme vulnerability to infections(resptratory infection(82%, 146/178), inpection of gastroin testinal(76%, 135/178)). The common laboratory examinations showed hypogammaglobulinemia, CD4(+) lymphopenia(93%, 107/115) etc. Diagnosis relies on the flow-cytometric analysis and genetic analysis.It is considered necessary for patients with young onset age, manifestation of clinically opportunistic infection as immune deficient disease, including the MHC class ‚Ö° deficiency disease, especially long-term diarrhea, poor development and cryptosporidium infection. This disease could coexist with autoimmune disorders.\n",
      "Proximal interstitial 6q deletion involving Single-minded 1 (SIM1) gene causes a syndromic form of obesity mimicking Prader-Willi syndrome. In addition to obesity, Prader-Willi syndrome includes several other endocrinopathies, such as hypothyroidism, growth hormone deficiency, and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. The endocrine phenotype of interstitial 6q deletion remains largely unknown, although clinical similarities between Prader-Willi syndrome and interstitial 6q deletion suggest endocrine abnormalities also may contribute to the interstitial 6q deletion phenotype. This report describes the endocrine phenotype in a propositus with the Prader-Willi-like syndrome associated with an interstitial 6q deletion including the SIM1 gene. Detailed endocrine evaluation of the propositus during childhood and adolescence revealed hypopituitarism, though initial endocrine evaluations during infancy were unremarkable. Our patient raises the possibility that hypopituitarism may be part of the phenotype, especially short stature, caused by interstitial 6q deletion. SIM1 plays an important role in the development of neuroendocrine lineage cells, implicating SIM1 haploinsufficiency in the pathophysiology of hypopituitarism seen in our propositus. Early identification of endocrine abnormalities can improve clinical outcome by allowing timely introduction of hormone replacement therapy. Hence, we suggest that detailed endocrine evaluation and longitudinal endocrine follow up be performed in individuals with proximal interstitial 6q deletion involving SIM1.\n",
      "Classical 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3beta-HSD) deficiency is a rare cause of congenital adrenal hyperplasia. We report two sisters presenting with delayed diagnoses of classical 3beta-HSD, despite salt wasting (SW) episodes in infancy. Sibling 1 was referred for premature pubarche, slight growth acceleration, and advanced bone age, whereas sibling 2 had no signs of virilization. At referral, increased 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone associated with premature pubarche at first suggested a nonclassical 21-hydroxylase deficiency. Sequencing of the CYP21 gene showed both girls only heterozygotes (V281L mutation). This result, combined with SW in infancy, suggested a 3beta-HSD deficiency because of increased dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels. Further hormonal studies showed markedly elevated Delta5-steroids, in particular 17alpha-hydroxypregnenolone greater than 100 nmol/liter (the clue to the diagnosis) and elevated Delta5-/Delta4-steroid ratios. Sequencing of the type II 3beta-HSD gene documented that both girls were compound heterozygotes for T181I and 1105delA mutations. Retrospectively, elevated levels of 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone were found on blood spots from Guthrie's test. There is no previous report of the combination of SW and premature pubarche due to mutations in the type II 3beta-HSD gene. Because neonatal diagnosis could have prevented life-threatening crises in these girls, this report further supports the benefits for neonatal screening for congenital adrenal hyperplasia whatever the etiology.\n",
      "Congenital pancytopenia is a rare and often lethal condition. Current knowledge of lymphoid and hematopoietic development in mice, as well as understanding regulators of human hematopoiesis, have led to the recent discovery of genetic causes of bone marrow failure disorders. However, in the absence of mutations of specific genes or a distinct clinical phenotype, many cases of aplastic anemia are labeled as idiopathic, while congenital immune deficiencies are described as combined immune deficiency.We describe the case of a 33-week gestation age male with severe polyhydramnios, hydrops, and ascites who was noted to be pancytopenic at birth. Bone marrow examination revealed a hypocellular marrow with absent myelopoiesis. An immune workup demonstrated profound B lymphopenia, near absent NK cells, and normal T cell number. Due to the similarity of the patient's phenotype with the IKAROS knockout mouse, studies were performed on bone marrow and peripheral blood to assess a potential pathogenic role of Ikaros.DNA studies revealed a point mutation in one allele of the IKAROS gene, resulting in an amino acid substitution in the DNA-binding zinc finger domain. Functional studies demonstrated that the observed mutation decreased Ikaros DNA-binding affinity, and immunofluorescence microscopy revealed aberrant Ikaros pericentromeric localization.Our report describes a novel case of congenital pancytopenia associated with mutation of the IKAROS gene. Furthermore, these data suggest a critical role of IKAROS in human hematopoiesis and immune development.\n",
      "A large family is reported in which at least four males are, or have been, affected with an unusual form of mental retardation associated with short stature, obesity, hypogonadism and skin disease. Investigations in the proband indicate that the hypogonadism is primary rather than secondary, and that the skin involvement is ichthyosiform. The mode of inheritance is entirely consistent with sex-linkage.\n",
      "Deafness, cataract, muscular atrophy, skeletal abnormalities, retardation of growth, underdeveloped secondary sexual characteristics, and electrocardiographic abnormalities are the features of a new, probably hereditary syndrome. Case reports are presented.\n",
      "We report on 3 individuals, a man and his son and daughter, who were born with preaxial deficiencies of the hands and feet and postaxial polydactyly of the hands. Both males also had glandular hypospadias. Certain of these findings resemble those found in the hand-foot-genital syndrome; however, we conclude that this family has a hitherto unreported autosomal dominant condition. Production by a single gene defect of preaxial deficiencies and postaxial polydactyly in the same individual is of note.\n",
      "Ohdo blepharophimosis syndrome (OBS) is a multiple congenital anomalies-mental retardation syndrome composed of blepharophimosis, ptosis, dental hypoplasia, partial deafness, and mental retardation. Previously reported cases of OBS have been sporadic except for the report by Ohdo et al. [1986, J Med Genet 23:242-244] that described two affected sisters and a first cousin favoring autosomal recessive inheritance. The original report by Ohdo et al. [1986] may reflect nonpenetrance of an autosomal dominantly inherited disorder or genetic heterogeneity of OBS. We report on a child and the mother who have blepharophimosis, ptosis, dental anomalies, mild hearing loss, and mental retardation. Chromosome analysis in both showed a balanced paracentric inversion of the long arm of chromosome 9, which was also present in two phenotypically normal sibs of the mother. This is the first report of vertical transmission of OBS suggestive of autosomal dominant inheritance. X-linked dominant and mitochondrial inheritance are other possible modes of inheritance.\n",
      "Maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 20 (UPD(20)mat) has been reported in only four patients, three of whom also had mosaicism for complete or partial trisomy of chromosome 20. We sought to evaluate the clinical significance of isolated UPD(20)mat in eight individuals.We evaluated phenotypic and genomic findings of a series of eight new patients with UPD(20)mat.All eight individuals with UPD(20)mat had intrauterine growth restriction, short stature, and prominent feeding difficulties with failure to thrive. As a common feature, they often required gastric tube feeds. Genomic data in most patients are indicative of UPD as a result of trisomy rescue after meiosis II nondisjunction.We describe the first natural history of the disorder and the results of therapeutic interventions, including the frequent requirement of direct gastric feedings only during the first few years of life, and propose that growth hormone supplementation is probably safe and effective for this condition. We suggest that UPD(20)mat can be regarded as a new imprinting disorder and its identification requires specialized molecular testing, which should be performed in patients with early-onset idiopathic isolated growth failure.Genet Med 18 4, 309-315.\n",
      "Hemihyperplasia can be found as an isolated abnormality, or as a predominant associated feature of an asymmetric overgrowth syndrome. This report describes 2 patients with hemihyperplasia-multiple lipomatosis syndrome. The finding of hemihyperplasia prompts careful examination for associated lipomatous lesions. Close follow-up is required because progressive growth of lipomatous lesions can be encountered as well as recurrence after excision.\n",
      "Glycogen, which serves as a major energy reserve in cells, is a large, branched polymer of glucose molecules. We describe a patient who had muscle weakness, associated with the depletion of glycogen in skeletal muscle, and cardiac arrhythmia, associated with the accumulation of abnormal storage material in the heart. The skeletal muscle showed a marked predominance of slow-twitch, oxidative muscle fibers and mitochondrial proliferation. Western blotting showed the presence of unglucosylated glycogenin-1 in the muscle and heart. Sequencing of the glycogenin-1 gene, GYG1, revealed a nonsense mutation in one allele and a missense mutation, Thr83Met, in the other. The missense mutation resulted in inactivation of the autoglucosylation of glycogenin-1 that is necessary for the priming of glycogen synthesis in muscle.\n",
      "We describe a mother and daughter with a distinct phenotype that is different from previous reports. This is likely to constitute a new syndrome for which we propose the mnemonic GMS for G goniodysgenesis, M mental deficiency, and S short stature. The pattern of occurrence is compatible with either autosomal dominant or X-linked inheritance.\n",
      "Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS) is a premature aging disorder caused by mutations in LMNA, which encodes the nuclear scaffold proteins lamin A and C. In HGPS and related progerias, processing of prelamin A is blocked at a critical step mediated by the zinc metalloprotease ZMPSTE24. LMNA-linked progerias can be grouped into two classes: (1) the processing-deficient, early onset \"typical\" progerias (e.g., HGPS), and (2) the processing-proficient \"atypical\" progeria syndromes (APS) that are later in onset. Here we describe a previously unrecognized progeria syndrome with prominent cutaneous and cardiovascular manifestations belonging to the second class. We suggest the name LMNA-associated cardiocutaneous progeria syndrome (LCPS) for this disorder. Affected patients are normal at birth but undergo progressive cutaneous changes in childhood and die in middle age of cardiovascular complications, including accelerated atherosclerosis, calcific valve disease, and cardiomyopathy. In addition, the proband demonstrated cancer susceptibility, a phenotype rarely described for LMNA-based progeria disorders. The LMNA mutation that caused LCPS in this family is a heterozygous c.899A>G (p.D300G) mutation predicted to alter the coiled-coil domain of lamin A/C. In skin fibroblasts isolated from the proband, the processing and levels of lamin A and C are normal. However, nuclear morphology is aberrant and rescued by treatment with farnesyltransferase inhibitors, as is also the case for HGPS and other laminopathies. Our findings advance knowledge of human LMNA progeria syndromes, and raise the possibility that typical and atypical progerias may converge upon a common mechanism to cause premature aging disease.\n",
      "A 5-week-old male infant presented with severe bacterial infections and poor wound healing, suggesting a neutrophil defect. Neutrophils from this patient exhibited decreased chemotaxis, polarization, azurophilic granule secretion, and superoxide anion (O(2)(-)) production but had normal expression and up-regulation of CD11b. Rac2, which constitutes >96% of the Rac in neutrophils, is a member of the Rho family of GTPases that regulates the actin cytoskeleton and O(2)(-) production. Western blot analysis of lysates from patient neutrophils demonstrated decreased levels of Rac2 protein. Addition of recombinant Rac to extracts of the patient neutrophils reconstituted O(2)(-) production in an in vitro assay system. Molecular analysis identified a point mutation in one allele of the Rac2 gene resulting in the substitution of Asp57 by an Asn (Rac2(D57N)). Asp57 is invariant in all defined GTP-binding proteins. Rac2(D57N) binds GDP but not GTP and inhibits oxidase activation and O(2)(-) production in vitro. These data represent the description of an inhibitory mutation in a member of the Rho family of GTPases associated with a human immunodeficiency syndrome.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: To present a syndrome composed of sensorineural hearing loss, early greying of scalp hair, and adult-onset essential tremor. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. SETTING: Tertiary care academic hospital. RESULTS: Three individuals were seen with this triad, each with family members with similar features. Our patients are a 65-year-old man and two women in their 40s. Two noted hearing loss in adulthood, one as a child. All had complete greying in their 20s. The women developed essential tremor in their 20s, and the man in his 50s. All individuals have blue eyes without heterochromia. Additional evaluation failed to further categorize these patients. Each has two or more immediate family members with a combination of these findings. Molecular genetic testing suggests this is not a variant of Waardenburg syndrome. CONCLUSION: We believe this represents a previously unreported hereditary syndrome. SIGNIFICANCE: This new syndrome should be considered in the context of other syndromes involving audition, pigmentation, and movement.\n",
      "Two autosomal recessive muscle diseases, limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B (LGMD2B) and Miyoshi myopathy (MM), are caused by mutations in the dysferlin gene. These mutations result in poor ability to repair cell membrane damage, which is suggested to be the cause for this disease. However, many patients who share clinical features with MM-type muscular dystrophy do not carry mutations in dysferlin gene. To understand the basis of MM that is not due to mutations in dysferlin gene, we analyzed cells from patients in one such family. In these patients, we found no defects in several potential candidates - annexin A2, caveolin-3, myoferlin and the MMD2 locus on chromosome 10p. Similar to dysferlinopathy, these cells also exhibit membrane repair defects and the severity of the defect correlated with severity of their disease. However, unlike dysferlinopathy, none of the conventional membrane repair pathways are defective in these patient cells. These results add to the existing evidence that cell membrane repair defect may be responsible for MM-type muscular dystrophy and indicate that a previously unsuspected genetic lesion that affects cell membrane repair pathway is responsible for the disease in the non-dysferlin MM patients.\n",
      "We describe a metabolic defect in bile acid synthesis involving a deficiency in 7alpha-hydroxylation due to a mutation in the gene for the microsomal oxysterol 7alpha-hydroxylase enzyme, active in the acidic pathway for bile acid synthesis. The defect, identified in a 10-wk-old boy presenting with severe cholestasis, cirrhosis, and liver synthetic failure, was established by fast atom bombardment ionization-mass spectrometry, which revealed elevated urinary bile acid excretion, a mass spectrum with intense ions at m/z 453 and m/z 510 corresponding to sulfate and glycosulfate conjugates of unsaturated monohydroxy-cholenoic acids, and an absence of primary bile acids. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometric analysis confirmed the major products of hepatic synthesis to be 3beta-hydroxy-5-cholenoic and 3beta-hydroxy-5-cholestenoic acids, which accounted for 96% of the total serum bile acids. Levels of 27-hydroxycholesterol were > 4,500 times normal. The biochemical findings were consistent with a deficiency in 7alpha-hydroxylation, leading to the accumulation of hepatotoxic unsaturated monohydroxy bile acids. Hepatic microsomal oxysterol 7alpha-hydroxylase activity was undetectable in the patient. Gene analysis revealed a cytosine to thymidine transition mutation in exon 5 that converts an arginine codon at position 388 to a stop codon. The truncated protein was inactive when expressed in 293 cells. These findings indicate the quantitative importance of the acidic pathway in early life in humans and define a further inborn error in bile acid synthesis as a metabolic cause of severe cholestatic liver disease.\n",
      "Boomerang dysplasia is a rare lethal osteochondrodysplasia characterized by disorganized mineralization of the skeleton, leading to complete nonossification of some limb bones and vertebral elements, and a boomerang-like aspect to some of the long tubular bones. Like many short-limbed skeletal dysplasias with accompanying thoracic hypoplasia, the potential lethality of the phenotype can be difficult to ascertain prenatally. We report a case of boomerang dysplasia prenatally diagnosed by use of ultrasonography and 3D-CT imaging, and identified a novel mutation in the gene encoding the cytoskeletal protein filamin B (FLNB) postmortem. Findings that aided the radiological diagnosis of this condition in utero included absent ossification of two out of three long bones in each limb and elements of the vertebrae and a boomerang-like shape to the ulnae. The identified mutation is the third described for this disorder and is predicted to lead to amino acid substitution in the actin-binding domain of the filamin B molecule.\n",
      "Chylous ascites is defined as the accumulation of chyle in the peritoneum due to obstruction or rupture of the peritoneal or retroperitoneal lymphatic glands. Chylous ascites that arises from acute pancreatitis with portal vein thrombosis is very rare. We report here on a case of chylous ascite that was caused by acute pancreatitis with portal vein thrombosis, in which the patient showed an impressive response to conservative therapy with total parenteral nutrition and octerotide. We also review the relevant literature about chylous ascites with particular reference to the management of this rare disease.\n",
      "The acrocephalosyndactyly syndromes (ACS) are a group of clinically similar disorders that share the manifestations of craniosynostosis and a variety of hand and foot anomalies. Here we report on a 5-generation kindred segregating sagittal craniosynostosis and syndactyly of the fingers and the toes in an autosomal dominant manner. The anomalies seen in this kindred comprise a syndrome distinct from other craniosynostosis syndromes. For this novel syndrome, we propose the name craniosynostosis, Philadelphia type.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Inherited optic neuropathy has been ascribed to mutations in mitochondrial fusion/fission dynamics genes, nuclear and mitochondrial DNA-encoded respiratory enzyme genes or nuclear genes of poorly known mitochondrial function. However, the disease causing gene remains unknown in many families. METHODS: We used exome sequencing in order to identify the gene responsible for isolated or syndromic optic atrophy in five patients from three independent families. RESULTS: We found homozygous or compound heterozygous missense and frameshift mutations in the gene encoding mitochondrial aconitase (ACO2), a tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme, catalysing interconversion of citrate into isocitrate. Unlike wild type ACO2, all mutant ACO2 proteins failed to complement the respiratory growth of a yeast aco1-deletion strain. Retrospective studies using patient-derived cultured skin fibroblasts revealed various degrees of deficiency in ACO2 activity, but also in ACO1 cytosolic activity. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that autosomal recessive ACO2 mutations can cause either isolated or syndromic optic neuropathy. This observation identifies ACO2 as the second gene responsible for non-syndromic autosomal recessive optic neuropathies and provides evidence for a genetic overlap between isolated and syndromic forms, giving further support to the view that optic atrophy is a hallmark of defective mitochondrial energy supply.\n",
      "Interstitial 17q24.1 or 17q24.2 deletions were reported after conventional cytogenetic analysis or chromosomal microarray analysis in patients presenting intellectual disability, facial dysmorphism, and/or malformations. We report on a fetus with craniofacial dysmorphism, talipes equinovarus, and syndactyly associated with a de novo 2.5‚ÄâMb 17q24.1q24.2 deletion. Among the deleted genes, KPNA2 and PSMD12 are discussed for the correlation with the fetal phenotype. This is the first case of prenatal diagnosis of 17q24.1q24.2 deletion.\n",
      "Chronic childhood neuropathies are predominantly hereditary in origin. Specific distinct clinical entities have been described, however, occasionally children with an unusual clinical phenotype are encountered in practice. We describe four children (3 males, 1 female) of Lebanese Moslem descent all sharing a common great-great-grandparent pairing with such a novel clinical spectrum. The three males were first cousins, each the product of a different parental consanguineous (i.e., parents second cousins) mating, whereas the female was a third cousin to each of the males whose parents were also second cousins. Each child presented early in life with developmental delay with associated hypotonia and areflexia. All had a sensorineural hearing loss documented and two of the patients were dysmorphic in facial appearance. Nerve conduction studies highlighted a sensory axonal neuropathy and sural nerve biopsy undertaken in two patients confirmed an axonal neuropathy. Detailed genetic and metabolic testing was negative. Followed into later childhood, each child continued to manifest motoric impairment, unsteadiness, areflexia, and cognitive disability. These children appear to provide evidence for a novel autosomal recessive inherited chronic predominantly sensory neuropathy that shares core clinical features with observed variability in associated symptoms.\n",
      "A 78-year-old woman who had been suffering from psoriasis vulgaris for 31 years was admitted to hospital because of her erythroderma. A toxic eruption was suspected and she was treated with prednisolone 30 mg daily. However, it was ineffective and, suspecting psoriatic erythroderma, cyclosporine 150 mg daily was administered with tapering of the prednisolone. Two weeks after a dose reduction of cyclosporine to 100 mg/day, erythroderma with widespread generalized pustules and fever developed. Histology of a biopsy revealed inflammatory infiltrates in the skin with a spongiform pustule of Kogoj, which was consistent with generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP). Her pustules improved with additional etretinate 20 mg/day, but the erythroderma persisted and she consulted us. Three sessions of granulocyte and monocyte apheresis once weekly were effective for her condition and decreased her serum levels of IL-6 and IL-8. She had homozygous mutations of c.[28C>T] in IL36RN which cause p.[Arg10Ter]. She is the oldest reported case of GPP with a deficiency of interleukin-36 receptor antagonist (DITRA), although GPP in DITRA has been suggested to usually occur in younger cases with no pre-existing psoriasis vulgaris.\n",
      "An autosomal dominant hereditary bone dysplasia was observed in three members of a Sardinian family living in Germany--the father and two sons. The guiding clinical symptom is thickening of the wrist proximal to the styloid process of the ulna. The radiologically recognizable changes--non-calcified cartilaginous islands protruding like cones into the metaphysis--begin with the onset of puberty and are not always associated with pain. Varying degrees of thickening and bowing of the relatively poorly mineralized metaphyseal region, particularly of the distal ulna, occur at the end of skeletal development. Thickening of the dorsum sellae is also characteristic. Serum calcium levels remain slightly elevated throughout life. The metatarsals, metacarpals and the distal fibula are dysplastic to varying degrees. The two boys display a coxa valga. Skeletal development is retarded. A developmental disorder of the vertebral column may form part of the condition, which defied allocation to any of the acknowledged forms of skeletal disease.\n",
      "A severe muscle enolase deficiency, with 5% of residual activity, was detected in a 47-year-old man affected with exercise intolerance and myalgias. No rise of serum lactate was observed with the ischemic forearm exercise. Ultrastructural analysis showed focal sarcoplasmic accumulation of glycogen beta particles. The enzyme enolase catalyzes the interconversion of 2-phosphoglycerate and phosphoenolpyruvate. In adult human muscle, over 90% of enolase activity is accounted for by the beta-enolase subunit, the protein product of the ENO3 gene. The beta-enolase protein was dramatically reduced in the muscle of our patient, by both immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting, while alpha-enolase was normally represented. The ENO3 gene of our patient carries two heterozygous missense mutations affecting highly conserved amino acid residues; a G467A transition changing a glycine residue at position 156 to aspartate, in close proximity to the catalytic site, and a G1121A transition changing a glycine to glutamate at position 374. These mutations were probably inherited as autosomal recessive traits since the mother was heterozygous for the G467A and a sister was heterozygous for the G1121A transition. Our data suggest that ENO3 mutations result in decreased stability of mutant beta-enolase. Muscle beta-enolase deficiency should be considered in the differential diagnosis of metabolic myopathies due to inherited defects of distal glycolysis.\n",
      "Keratoderma hereditarium mutilans, or Vohwinkel syndrome, is a very rare genetic skin condition which causes palmoplantar hyperkeratosis and constricting rings of the fingers and toes. Approximately 50 cases have been reported in the literature with only three having been managed surgically. All three had a high rate of recurrence and unfavourable results in the long term. We report two more cases managed surgically with a follow up of 5 and 8 years respectively. Our experience suggests that the use of full thickness grafts to line the released contractures does not work in the long term as the grafts become raised and painful, requiring multiple revisions. Surgical correction was easy to achieve but difficult to maintain and achieved poor outcomes in general. We therefore feel that the indication for surgical treatment should be a neurovascular compromise.\n",
      "Review of 10 cases of asphyxiating thoracic dysplasia has shown a wide range of clinical effects and some variability in the radiographic features. Respiratory difficulty was severe in 7 babies and lethal in 6 of these. The seventh child is remarkable for his normal stature and excellent health at 15 years of age. 3 babies had no respiratory difficulty but 2 of them subsequently died of renal failure; one remains alive at 3 years. Microscopical abnormalities in the liver and kidneys were very frequent and appeared to increase progressively with age.\n",
      "Sclerosteosis and Van Buchem disease are related recessive sclerosing bone dysplasias caused by alterations in the SOST gene. We tested the hypothesis that craniodiaphyseal dysplasia (CDD) (MIM 122860), an extremely rare sclerosing bone dysplasia resulting facial distortion referred to as \"leontiasis ossea\", could also be caused by SOST mutations. We discovered mutations c.61G>A (Val21Met) and c.61G>T (Val21Leu) two children with CDD. As these mutations are located in the secretion signal of the SOST gene, we tested their effect on secretion by transfecting the mutant constructs into 293E cells. Intriguingly, these mutations greatly reduced the secretion of SOST. We conclude that CDD, the most severe form of sclerotic bone disease, is part of a spectrum of disease caused by mutations in SOST. Unlike the other SOST-related conditions, sclerosteosis and Van Buchem disease that are inherited as recessive traits seem to be caused by a dominant negative mechanism.\n",
      "5q14.3 deletions spanning and flanking MEF2C as well as intragenic MEF2C mutations have recently been described as a cause of severe intellectual disability, epilepsy, and muscular hypotonia, with variable brain and other anomalies. With an increasing number of patients described, the clinical presentation of the patients appears to be relatively uniform, however the structural brain phenotypes described are variable. We describe two unrelated patients with overlapping de novo interstitial deletions of 4.1 and 1.9 Mb, including MEF2C in 5q14.3, one of whom had a complex brain malformation which could be best described as microcephaly with simplified gyral pattern (MSG). Expression analysis in both patients confirmed haploinsufficiency for MEF2C, decreased MECP2 expression and increased C3ORF58 (DIA1) expression, which is a new finding. A detailed analysis of brain and white matter abnormalities reported in patients with 5q14.3 deletion syndrome to date revealed a greater number of reported abnormalities in patients with deletions not including MEF2C than those with deletions or mutations directly affecting MEF2C. Screening an additional 43 patients with malformations of cerebral cortical development (MCD) for mutations in MEF2C and/or deletions in 5q14.3q15, did not detect any additional mutations, allowing us to conclude that 5q14.3 deletion syndrome is a rare cause of microcephaly with simplified gyral pattern.\n",
      "Two male Arab sibs are reported with congenital heart disease and skeletal malformations. Other published case reports sharing some features in common with these brothers are considered. However, clinical and radiological features in these boys are distinct enough to represent a new cardioskeletal syndrome.\n",
      "We report on a novel autosomal dominant disorder with variable phenotypic expression in a three-generation family; the major features include hypertelorism, preauricular sinus, deafness, and punctal pits with lacrimal-duct obstruction. We ruled out the involvement of EYA1, SIX1, and SIX5 as candidate genes by direct sequencing of their exons and by SNP-based linkage analysis. Subsequent SNP-based whole-genome genotyping and parametric multipoint linkage analysis gave lod scores >1 at 14q31 (LOD‚Äâ=‚Äâ3.14), 11q25 (LOD‚Äâ=‚Äâ1.87), and 8p23 (LOD‚Äâ=‚Äâ1.18). By genotyping additional microsatellite markers at two of these three loci and using an expanded phenotype definition, the LOD at 14q31 increased to 3.34. Direct sequencing of the gene exons within the 14q31 critical interval and a custom aCGH experiment did not show any pathogenic mutation or copy-number changes. Further sequencing of 21‚Äâkb of promoter regions showed a novel polymorphism 1,249‚Äâbp upstream from the SELIL start codon that segregated with the disease haplotype. Cloning the novel polymorphism into luciferase reporter constructs resulted in a 20% reduction in the expression levels. The identification of this family with a distinctive clinical phenotype and linkage to a novel locus at 14q31 supports the existence of a new syndrome of the branchial cleft.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Green jaundice is a rare finding usually associated with end-stage liver disease. OBJECTIVE The authors investigated two unrelated Inuit women from different geographical areas in Greenland who had episodes of green jaundice associated with biliary obstruction. METHODS AND RESULTS: The crises were accompanied by increased biochemical markers of cholestasis, together with absent or moderate hyperbilirubinaemia. In contrast, high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry showed hypercholanaemia and high concentrations of biliverdin IXŒ± in serum, urine, bile and milk. Hyperbiliverdinaemia disappeared after surgical correction of the cholestasis. Analysis of the coding sequence of the biliverdin reductase alpha (BVRŒ±) gene (BLVRA) detected three single-nucleotide polymorphisms: c.90G‚ÜíA, c.214C‚ÜíA and c.743A‚ÜíC, which result in p.Ala3Thr, p.Ser44X and p.Gly220Gly, respectively. With the use of TaqMan probes, homozygosity for c.214C‚ÜíA was found in both patients. Both parents of one of these patients were heterozygous for the inactivating mutation. Her brother was homozygous for normal alleles. Although her sister was also homozygous for the c.214C‚ÜíA mutation, she had never had hyperbiliverdinaemia or cholestasis. With the use of human liver RNA, the BVRŒ± coding sequence was cloned, and the variant containing c.214C‚ÜíA was generated by site-directed mutagenesis. Both proteins were expressed in human hepatoma liver cells and Xenopus laevis oocytes. Immunoblotting, immunofluorescence and functional assays of BVRŒ± activity revealed that the mutated sequence generates a truncated protein with no catalytic activity. CONCLUSION: This is the first report of a homozygous BLVRA inactivating mutation indicating that the complete absence of BVRŒ± activity is a non-lethal condition, the most evident phenotypic characteristic of which is the appearance of green jaundice accompanying cholestasis episodes.\n",
      "Distal spinal muscular atrophy is a heterogeneous group of neuromuscular disorders caused by progressive anterior horn cell degeneration and characterized by progressive motor weakness and muscular atrophy, predominantly in the distal parts of the limbs. Here we report on chronic autosomal recessive distal spinal muscular atrophy in a large, inbred family with onset at various ages. Because this condition had some of the same clinical features as spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress, we tested the disease gene for linkage to chromosome 11q and mapped the disease locus to chromosome 11q13 in the genetic interval that included the spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress gene (D11S1889-D11S1321, Z(max) = 4.59 at theta = 0 at locus D11S4136). The sequencing of IGHMBP2, the human homologue of the mouse neuromuscular degeneration gene (nmd) that accounts for spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress, failed to detect any mutation in our chronic distal spinal muscular atrophy patients, suggesting that spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress and chronic distal spinal muscular atrophy are caused by distinct genes located in the same chromosomal region. In addition, the high intrafamilial variability in age at onset raises the question of whether nonallelic modifying genes could be involved in chronic distal spinal muscular atrophy.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To present the detailed phenotype of a subject with MRCS (microcornea, retinal dystrophy, cataract, and posterior staphyloma) syndrome and to investigate the underlying molecular genetic basis. DESIGN: Interventional case report. METHODS: Clinical examination, electrophysiologic assessment, B-scan ultrasonography, and mutation screening of the gene VMD2. The protocol of the study was approved by the local ethics committee and informed consent was obtained. RESULTS: A 12-year-old boy was identified with bilateral microcornea, rod-cone dystrophy, congenital cataracts, and posterior staphylomata associated with high myopia (MRCS). Mutation screening failed to identify disease-causing sequence variants in VMD2, the gene associated with MRCS syndrome. All previous subjects have had pathogenic VMD2 sequence alterations. CONCLUSIONS: We present a further report of the MRCS syndrome and provide evidence in support of genetic heterogeneity in this phenotype.\n",
      "Mutations in the nuclear-encoded mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are associated with a range of clinical phenotypes. Here, we report a novel disorder in three adult patients with a phenotype including cataracts, short-stature secondary to growth hormone deficiency, sensorineural hearing deficit, peripheral sensory neuropathy, and skeletal dysplasia. Using SNP genotyping and whole-exome sequencing, we identified a single likely causal variant, a missense mutation in a conserved residue of the nuclear gene IARS2, encoding mitochondrial isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase. The mutation is homozygous in the affected patients, heterozygous in carriers, and absent in control chromosomes. IARS2 protein level was reduced in skin cells cultured from one of the patients, consistent with a pathogenic effect of the mutation. Compound heterozygous mutations in IARS2 were independently identified in a previously unreported patient with a more severe mitochondrial phenotype diagnosed as Leigh syndrome. This is the first report of clinical findings associated with IARS2 mutations.\n",
      "The neuropathology of the primary dystonias is not well understood. We examined brains from identical twins with DYT1-negative, dopa-unresponsive dystonia. The twins exhibited mild developmental delays until age 12 years when they began developing rapidly progressive generalized dystonia. Genetic, metabolic, and imaging studies ruled out known causes of dystonia. Cognition was subnormal but stable until the last few years. Death occurred at ages 21 and 22 years. The brains were macroscopically unremarkable. Microscopic examination showed unusual glial fibrillary acidic protein-immunoreactive astrocytes in multiple regions and iron accumulation in pallidal and nigral neurons. However, the most striking findings were 1) eosinophilic, rod-like cytoplasmic inclusions in neocortical and thalamic neurons that were actin depolymerizing factor/cofilin-immunoreactive but only rarely actin-positive; and 2) abundant eosinophilic spherical structures in the striatum that were strongly actin- and actin depolymerizing factor/cofilin-positive. Electron microscopy suggested that these structures represent degenerating neurons and processes; the accumulating filaments had the same dimensions as actin microfilaments. To our knowledge, aggregation of actin has not been reported previously as the predominant feature in any neurodegenerative disease. Thus, our findings may shed light on a novel neuropathological change associated with dystonia that may represent a new degenerative mechanism involving actin, a ubiquitous constituent of the cytoskeletal system.\n",
      "Here we describe a patient with limb girdle muscular dystrophy 1A (LGMD1A) due to a novel myotilin gene (MYOT) mutation with late onset, rapid progression, loss of ambulation and respiratory failure. The onset of weakness in proximal muscles and muscle MRI findings are clearly different from the pattern identified in myofibrillar myopathies (MFM) related to MYOT mutations. Moreover, there was very limited evidence of myofibrillar pathology in several muscle biopsies obtained during the disease course. We conclude, that MYOT mutations need to be considered as a rare cause of adult-onset, dominant LGMD without clear-cut MFM pathology.\n",
      "Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a group of clinically and genetically diverse and autosomal-dominant disorders characterised by neurological deficits in the cerebellum. At present, there is no cure for SCAs. Of the different distinct subtypes of autosomal-dominant SCAs identified to date, causative genes for only a fraction of them are currently known. In this study, we investigated the cause of an autosomal-dominant SCA phenotype in a family that exhibits cerebellar ataxia and pontocerebellar atrophy along with a global reduction in brain volume.Whole-exome analysis revealed a missense mutation c.G1391A (p.R464H) in the coding region of the coiled-coil domain containing 88C (CCDC88C) gene in all affected individuals. Functional studies showed that the mutant form of CCDC88C activates the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway, induces caspase 3 cleavage and triggers apoptosis.This study expands our understanding of the cause of autosomal-dominant SCAs, a group of heterogeneous congenital neurological conditions in humans, and unveils a link between the JNK stress pathway and cerebellar atrophy.\n",
      "We describe two sibs, one male and one female, presenting a new autosomal recessive multiple congenital anomalies/mental retardation syndrome of 'coarse face', microcephaly, moderate to severe mental retardation, epilepsy and skeletal abnormalities.\n",
      "Only two patients with 14q12 deletion have been reported to date. Here, we describe an additional patient with a similar deletion in order to improve the clinical delineation of this new microdeletion syndrome. The emerging phenotype is characterized by a Rett-like clinical course with an almost normal development during the first months of life followed by a period of regression. A peculiar facial phenotype is also present and it is characterized by mild dysmorphisms such as downslanting palpebral fissures, bilateral epicanthic folds, depressed nasal bridge, bulbous nasal tip, tented upper lip, everted lower lip and large ears. The relationship between this microdeletion syndrome and the congenital variant of Rett syndrome due to point mutations in one of the genes included in the deleted region, FOXG1, is discussed.\n",
      "PEHO syndrome is a rare progressive infantile encephalopathy with onset within the first few months of life. Few patients fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for PEHO syndrome have been reported outside Finland. Affected infants have facial dysmorphism and suffer from severe hypotonia, profound mental retardation, convulsions (often with a hypsarrhythmic EEG pattern), transient or persistent peripheral oedema, and optic atrophy. Cerebellar and brainstem atrophy are usually present on neuroimaging. A PEHO-like syndrome has been described, in which the affected individuals have neither optic atrophy nor the typical neuroradiological findings. We report five Australian patients, the first with classical features of PEHO syndrome, and four who have a PEHO-like disorder. We compare their features with other published cases. We suggest that PEHO or a PEHO-like syndrome may affect more patients than are currently identified, based on the original diagnostic criteria for this disorder.\n",
      "An X-linked myopathy was recently associated with mutations in the four-and-a-half-LIM domains 1 (FHL1) gene. We identified a family with late onset, slowly progressive weakness of scapuloperoneal muscles in three brothers and their mother. A novel missense mutation in the LIM2 domain of FHL1 (W122C) co-segregated with disease in the family. The phenotype was less severe than that in other reported families. Muscle biopsy revealed myopathic changes with FHL1 inclusions that were ubiquitin- and desmin-positive. This mutation provides additional evidence for X-linked myopathy caused by a narrow spectrum of mutations in FHL1, mostly in the LIM2 domain. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the newly identified mutation and five previously published missense mutations in the LIM2 domain revealed no major distortions of the protein structure or disruption of zinc binding. There were, however, increases in the nonpolar, solvent-accessible surface area in one or both of two clusters of residues, suggesting that the mutant proteins have a variably increased propensity to aggregate. Review of the literature shows a wide range of phenotypes associated with mutations in FHL1. However, recognizing the typical scapuloperoneal phenotype and X-linked inheritance pattern will help clinicians arrive at the correct diagnosis.\n",
      "An 8-year-old male patient presented a unique pattern of congenital anomalies. Prominent findings included a combination of severe osteoporosis and congenital oculocutaneous hypopigmentation. The patient may represent a hitherto undescribed syndrome of unknown etiology.\n",
      "Holzgreve et al. [Am J Med Genet 18:177-184, 1984] first reported on a syndrome including renal anomalies, heart defect, polydactyly, and cleft palate with other oropharyngeal anomalies. We report here on four sibs with renal adysplasia associated in two with cardiovascular malformations and cleft lip or cleft palate in two. We propose that these patients as the two siblings reported by Thomas et al. [Am J Med Genet 45:767-769, 1993] are affected with a syndrome different of the one described by Holzgreve et al. [Am J Med Genet 18:177-184, 1984] mainly because of the absence of polydactyly. Thomas syndrome is probably inherited as an autosomal recessive trait with marked variability.\n",
      "Two sisters and an unrelated girl presented a distinct intrauterine growth retardation-malformation syndrome with short stature, microcephaly, pectus excavatum, hip dislocation, hypoplastic pubic region and genitalia, camptodactyly, talipes, shortened 2nd toes, hypoplastic patella and skeletal dysplasia probably due to homozygosity from an autosomal recessive gene.\n",
      "Some patients with microvillus inclusion disease due to myosin 5B (MYO5B) mutations may develop cholestasis characterized by a progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis-like phenotype with normal serum gamma-glutamyl transferase activity. So far MYO5B deficiency has not been reported in patients with such a cholestasis phenotype in the absence of intestinal disease. Using a new-generation sequencing approach, we identified MYO5B mutations in five patients with progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis-like phenotype with normal serum gamma-glutamyl transferase activity without intestinal disease.These data show that MYO5B deficiency may lead to isolated cholestasis and that MYO5B should be considered as an additional progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis gene. (Hepatology 2017;65:164-173).\n",
      "Familial multiple trichodiscomas is a condition characterized by multiple asymptomatic skin papules. The inheritance pattern has not been established. The skin lesions usually appear in childhood. The diagnosis of the cutaneous papules is established by pathologic evaluation. Birt-Hogg-Dub√© syndrome is excluded by not detecting any aberration in the folliculin gene locus. Including our patient, 15 index individuals and their families are described. There is no systemic organ involvement or associated malignancies in individuals with this condition.\n",
      "We present two previously unreported and unrelated female patients, one with the tentative diagnosis of acromegaloid facial appearance (AFA), the other with the tentative diagnosis of hypertrichosis with acromegaloid facial appearance (HAFF) with or without gingival hyperplasia. Main clinical features of HAFF were generalized hypertrichosis terminalis and coarse facial features. In both patients, pregnancy was complicated by polyhydramnios, and both had hyperbilirubinemia and persistent fetal circulation. Development was normal in one patient and slightly delayed in the other. At 13 years, both had round faces with full cheeks, thick scalp hair and eyebrows, a low frontal hairline, hirsutism, hyperextensible joints and deep palmar creases. One of them additionally showed gingival hypertrophy and epicanthus, the other one was macrocephalic at birth and at the age of 13 years and suffered from repeated swelling of the soft tissue. Array analysis excluded a 17q24.2-q24.3 microdeletion, which has been reported in patients with hypertrichosis terminalis with or without gingival hyperplasia. Sequencing of the mutational hotspots of the ABCC9 gene revealed two different de novo missense mutations in the two patients. Recently, identical mutations have been found recurrently in patients with Cant√∫ syndrome. Therefore, we propose that ABCC9 mutations lead to a spectrum of phenotypes formerly known as Cant√∫ syndrome, HAFF and AFA, which may not be clearly distinguishable by clinical criteria, and that all patients with clinical signs belonging to this spectrum should be revisited and offered ABCC9 mutation analysis.\n",
      "Two cases of a new type of hereditary chondrodysplasia are reported. The main features were: severe dwarfism, progressive scoliosis and bilateral dislocation of the hip. A neurosensory type of deafness with retinitis pigmentosa was also present. Radiographs showed diffuse osteoporosis, severe retardation of bone-age and dysplasia of the femoral head. There was no associated metabolic abnormality. The disease seems to have a dominant autosomal pattern of inheritance with a variable degree of penetrance.\n",
      "Two sibs, whose parents are first cousins, had diabetes mellitus with hyperinsulinism, insensitive insulin receptors, and acanthosis nigricans. Both patients had pigmentary retinopathy, secondary cataracts, labyrinthine deafness, mental retardation, and cerebral atrophy. They were disproportionately short with relatively broad hands and feet and slightly coarse face. The young woman had secondary amenorrhea and polycystic ovaries and the boy gynecomastia and hypergonadotrophic hypogonadism. This appears to be the second family with a new autosomal recessive disorder differing from Alstr√∂m syndrome by the presence of mental retardation and absence of renal insufficiency. Impaired insulin receptor binding and polycystic ovaries are described as part of this syndrome.\n",
      "Two cases in a brother and sister of a previously undescribed hereditary syndrome are reported. The features, which include shortness of stature, photosensitivity and cerebellar-like ataxia, are attributed to a new inborn error of tryptophan metabolism.\n",
      "Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease represents a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of inherited neuropathies. Here, we report a five-generation family of eight affected individuals with CMT disease type 2, CMT2. Genome-wide linkage analysis showed that the disease phenotype is closely linked to chromosomal region 10p13-14, which spans 5.41 Mb between D10S585 and D10S1477. DNA-sequencing analysis revealed a nonsense mutation, c.1455T>G (p.Tyr485(‚àó)), in exon 8 of dehydrogenase E1 and transketolase domain-containing 1 (DHTKD1) in all eight affected individuals, but not in other unaffected individuals in this family or in 250 unrelated normal persons. DHTKD1 mRNA expression levels in peripheral blood of affected persons were observed to be half of those in unaffected individuals. In vitro studies have shown that, compared to wild-type mRNA and DHTKD1, mutant mRNA and truncated DHTKD1 are significantly decreased by rapid mRNA decay in transfected cells. Inhibition of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay by UPF1 silencing effectively rescued the decreased levels of mutant mRNA and protein. More importantly, DHTKD1 silencing was found to lead to impaired energy production, evidenced by decreased ATP, total NAD(+) and NADH, and NADH levels. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that the heterozygous nonsense mutation in DHTKD1 is one of CMT2-causative genetic alterations, implicating an important role for DHTKD1 in mitochondrial energy production and neurological development.\n",
      "Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is most often caused by mutations in the type I procollagen genes (COL1A1/COL1A2). We identified two children with substitutions in the type I procollagen C-propeptide cleavage site, which disrupt a unique processing step in collagen maturation and define a novel phenotype within OI. The patients have mild OI caused by mutations in COL1A1 (Patient 1: p.Asp1219Asn) or COL1A2 (Patient 2: p.Ala1119Thr), respectively. Patient 1 L1-L4 DXA Z-score was +3.9 and pQCT vBMD was+3.1; Patient 2 had L1-L4 DXA Z-score of 0.0 and pQCT vBMD of -1.8. Patient BMD contrasts with radiographic osteopenia and histomorphometry without osteosclerosis. Mutant procollagen processing is impaired in pericellular and in vitro assays. Patient dermal collagen fibrils have irregular borders. Incorporation of pC-collagen into matrix leads to increased bone mineralization. FTIR imaging confirms elevated mineral/matrix ratios in both patients, along with increased collagen maturation in trabecular bone, compared to normal or OI controls. Bone mineralization density distribution revealed a marked shift toward increased mineralization density for both patients. Patient 1 has areas of higher and lower bone mineralization than controls; Patient 2's bone matrix has a mineral content exceeding even classical OI bone. These patients define a new phenotype of high BMD OI and demonstrate that procollagen C-propeptide cleavage is crucial to normal bone mineralization.\n",
      "Two male patients from one family are reported, who are affected with congenital hydrocephalus, mental retardation, short stature, obesity and hypogenitalism. Most probably the mode of inheritance is X-linked recessive.\n",
      "Terminal osseous dysplasia with pigmentary defects (TODPD) is a rare, X-linked syndrome classically characterized by distal limb anomalies, pigmented skin defects of the face, and recurrent digital fibromas. X-inactivation plays a major role in determining the range of phenotypic expression. Thus, patients can demonstrate a wide spectrum of disease severity, making accurate diagnosis more challenging. Recent studies have identified a FLNA c.5217G>A mutation as the cause of TODPD, allowing for diagnostic genetic testing. We present a case of molecularly confirmed TODPD in a girl with the 47,XXX chromosomal complement and deformities of the hands and feet, craniofacial abnormalities, and discolored, linear facial lesions. Skin biopsy of the patient's facial lesion revealed absent papillary dermal elastic fibers, consistent with anetoderma, which contrasts with the dermal hypoplasia described in the only other such facial biopsy reported in the literature. The finding of absent elastic fibers in the skin lesions suggests that mutated filamin A, in part, exerts its effects through dysregulated elastin biology, which may explain the nature of many connective tissue pleotropic effects in FLNA-related disorders.\n",
      "ZNF335 was first reported in 2012 as a causative gene for microcephaly. Because only 1 consanguineous pedigree has ever been reported, the key clinical features associated with ZNF335 mutations remain unknown. In this article, we describe another family harboring ZNF335 mutations. The female proband was the first child of nonconsanguineous Japanese parents. At birth, microcephaly was absent; her head circumference was 32.0 cm (-0.6 SD). At 3 months, microcephaly was noted, (head circumference, 34.0 cm [-4.6 SD]). Brain MRI showed invisible basal ganglia, cerebral atrophy, brainstem hypoplasia, and cerebellar atrophy. At 33 months, (head circumference, 41.0 cm [-5.1 SD]), she had severe psychomotor retardation. After obtaining informed consent from her parents, we performed exome sequencing in the proband and identified 1 novel and 1 known mutation in ZNF335, namely, c.1399T>C (p.C467R) and c.1505A>G (p.Y502C), respectively. The mutations were individually transmitted by her parents, indicating that the proband was compound heterozygous for the mutations. Her brain imaging findings, including invisible basal ganglia, were similar to those observed in the previous case with ZNF335 mutations. We speculate that invisible basal ganglia may be the key feature of ZNF335 mutations. For infants presenting with both microcephaly and invisible basal ganglia, ZNF335 mutations should be considered as a differential diagnosis.\n",
      "The authors describe four unrelated girls with a distinctive neurologic disorder with early-onset progressive ataxia and hypodontia with a characteristic pattern of delayed dentition. Cerebral MRI shows hypomyelinated white matter and cerebellar atrophy; 1H-MRS of white matter reveals a marked elevation of myo-inositol.\n",
      "Previous reports have shown the association between familial spastic paraplegia and hypopigmentation of the skin. A family is reported in which three siblings presented with progressive spastic paraparesis and cerebellar ataxia. All the siblings had large hyperpigmented naevi of the lower extremities while none of the unaffected members had a skin lesion. A definite association appears to exist between heredo-familial ataxias and disordered skin pigmentation, but the exact mechanism remains unclear.\n",
      "In 1988 Pfeiffer and Kapferer reported on a patient with sensorineural deafness, psychomotor delay, hypospadias, cerebral manifestations, and bilateral synostosis of the 4th and 5th metacarpals and metatarsals. Synostosis of the 4th and 5th metacarpals and metatarsals is a very rare defect that has been described as an isolated Mendelian defect, as part of multiple congenital anomaly (MCA) patterns, and in different syndromes. Among a total of 2,023,155 liveborn infants in the Spanish Collaborative Study of Congenital Malformations (ECEMC), we observed only two cases with this type of metacarpal fusion, for a frequency of 1/1,011,577. One had the isolated defect, and the other one that we are describing here, had an MCA pattern similar to that described by Pfeiffer and Kapferer [1988]. We tested HOXD13 but did not find any mutations in exons and intron-exon boundaries. To our knowledge this case is the second one reported with this syndrome.\n",
      "We identified a family with three males in two generations with moderate mental retardation. The two oldest were first cousins whose mothers were sisters. The third affected was a grandson through a daughter of one of the sisters, strongly suggesting X- linked inheritance. The affected males had prominent glabella, synophrys, prognathism, generalized hirsutism, and bilateral single palmar creases. All developed seizures in childhood. The two oldest have had a slow deterioration in neurological status with poor gait and balance and progressive weakness. No deterioration in their mental status has been observed. The oldest had cerebellar atrophy confirmed on computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scans of the brain and prolonged nerve conduction velocity. Two of the males had hypogammaglobulinemia (IgA deficient). Two-point linkage analysis using 27 microsatellite markers on the X chromosome resulted in a maximum LOD score of 2.23 at straight theta = 0 for locus DSX101. Recombination was observed at locus DSX1170 in Xq21.33 and locus DXS8067 in Xq23. We conclude that this family represents an X-linked disorder associated with a recognizable phenotype, progressive neurological deterioration, and variable hypogammaglobulinemia. The gene appears to lie between Xq21.33 and Xq23.\n",
      "Endovascular papillary angioendothelioma, or Dabska tumor, was first presented in 1969 by Maria Dabska where she presented cases occurring in 6 children. The tumor was described as being a low-grade angiosarcoma characterized by papillary endovascular proliferations of atypical endothelial cells and anastomosing vascular channels within the dermis. Since its original description, only 30 case reports have been written describing the varying presentation, clinical course, and histopathology of this tumor. This case report documents the presentation and management of endovascular papillary angioendothelioma in a young male and reviews the current literature. Because more cases of EPAs are reported, perhaps a more standard approach to accurate diagnosis and treatment with surgical intervention and pathologic recognition via microscopy and immunohistochemistry can be determined.\n",
      "Three siblings from a consanguineous marriage were found to have a cleft lip. Two of them developed a progressive retinopathy which was identified as a cone-rod dystrophy. It is suggested that this association may represent a hitherto unreported entity with an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance, although chance co-occurrence cannot be excluded.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: The hallmarks of Perrault syndrome are progressive sensorineural hearing loss and ovarian dysgenesis, but the disorder is both clinically and genetically heterogenous. CASE: We report a 15-year-old girl with gonadal dysgenesis, unilateral sensorineural deafness, cataracts in both eyes, and Marfanoid body proportions diagnosed Perrault syndrome. We detected 14 single nucleotide variations including 2 homozygous missense change of c.317G>A (p.Arg106His) and c.1675A>G (p.Ile559Val) in HSD17B4. No significant mutation in HARS2 and PSMC3IP, and gene copy number variant were found as the cause of Perrault syndrome. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION: Mutations in HARS2, HSD17B4, and PSMC3IP genes do not explain Perrault syndrome in our patient, indicating that other critical genes remain to be identified.\n",
      "Mastocytosis refers to a heterogeneous group of rare disorders characterized by an abnormal accumulation of mast cells in one or more organ systems. Cutaneous mastocytosis (CM) is the most frequent form in children and is characterized by hyperpigmented macules or papules symmetrically distributed over the trunk, and less so over the limbs, neck, and scalp. Two published articles have reported on unrelated girls presenting with mastocytosis, microcephaly, hearing loss, and hypotonia. Based on the original observation, this disorder was defined as CM with short stature, conductive hearing loss, and microtia (OMIM 248910). Here we report on a girl with similar manifestations who corroborates the existence of this rare disorder. CM, microcephaly, microtia, and/or hearing loss are the minimal diagnostic criteria. All the known patients were sporadic, but parental consanguinity in the first case argues for a possible autosomal-recessive inheritance.\n",
      "We describe in two brothers an apparently novel syndrome comprising obesity, congenital hypothyroidism, neonatal colitis, cardiac biventricular hypertrophy, craniosynostosis, and developmental delay. The first brother presented with neonatal colitis and congenital hypothyroidism and died at age 5 weeks of fulminant colitis. The second brother presented neonatally with the same condition, but survived and subsequently developed severe obesity, sagittal and coronal synostosis, and developmental delay. Both pregnancies had been complicated by hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets (HELLP syndrome). Exhaustive genetic and metabolic investigations have failed to provide a unifying pathogenesis. This unique combination of manifestations appears to represent a new syndrome with probable autosomal recessive or X-linked recessive inheritance.\n",
      "Type I interferon (IFN-Œ±/Œ≤) is a fundamental antiviral defense mechanism. Mouse models have been pivotal to understanding the role of IFN-Œ±/Œ≤ in immunity, although validation of these findings in humans has been limited. We investigated a previously healthy child with fatal encephalitis after inoculation of the live attenuated measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. By targeted resequencing, we identified a homozygous mutation in the high-affinity IFN-Œ±/Œ≤ receptor (IFNAR2) in the proband, as well as a newborn sibling, that rendered cells unresponsive to IFN-Œ±/Œ≤. Reconstitution of the proband's cells with wild-type IFNAR2 restored IFN-Œ±/Œ≤ responsiveness and control of IFN-attenuated viruses. Despite the severe outcome of systemic live vaccine challenge, the proband had previously shown no evidence of heightened susceptibility to respiratory viral pathogens. The phenotype of IFNAR2 deficiency, together with similar findings in STAT2-deficient patients, supports an essential but narrow role for IFN-Œ±/Œ≤ in human antiviral immunity.\n",
      "A new type of mesomelic dysplasia was in 3 generations of a large Thai family. It is characterized by bilateral symmetrical marked shortening of the ulnae and shortening and bowing of the radii. The proximal fibula is usually short and synostoses are present between the tibia and fibula and the small malformed calcaneus and talus. The prominent calcanei on the ventral surfaces of the distal fibulae are a characteristic feature of the new type. Carpal and tarsal synostoses are present in some affected people. All affected individuals walk on the tips of their toes with the dorsal foot deviated laterally. The deformities of the radius and ulna somewhat resemble those of mesomelic dysplasia, Langer type, but otherwise the condition is distinctly different. This new mesomelic dysplasia is an autosomal dominant trait with complete penetrance and variable expressivity over 3 generations.\n",
      "We report on two brothers and their maternal first cousin who have branchial arch defects and other anomalies. Similar physical findings in all three include microcephaly, downslanting palpebral fissures, highly arched palate, apparently lowset, protruding ears, bilateral hearing loss, slightly webbed neck, and mild short stature. In addition, two boys had cryptorchidism, and one had subvalvar pulmonic stenosis and body asymmetry. We suggest that these cousins have an X-linked syndrome of which branchial arch defects are a component. Other pleiotropic manifestations of the mutant gene include microcephaly and cryptorchidism; body asymmetry and relatively short stature may be components as well.\n",
      "STUDY OBJECTIVES:To determine the age- and sex-specific incidence rates and prevalence of narcolepsy in a United States community. DESIGN:The records-linkage system of the Rochester Epidemiology Project was utilized to ascertain all patients with narcolepsy seen in Olmsted County, Minnesota between 1960 and 1989. Age- and sex-specific incidence rates were calculated, using census data. Prevalence of narcolepsy on January 1,1985 was calculated. SETTING:N/A. PATIENTS OR PARTICIPANTS:Community patients diagnosed with narcolepsy by a validated set of diagnostic criteria. INTERVENTIONS:N/A. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS:The incidence rate per 100,000 persons per year was 1.37 (1.72 for men and 1.05 for women). The incidence rate was highest in the 2nd decade, followed in descending order by the 3rd, 4th and 1st decades. The prevalence on January 1, 1985 was 56.3 per 100,000 persons. Approximately 36% of prevalence cases did not have cataplexy. CONCLUSIONS:Narcolepsy is not a rare disorder. It appears to be commoner in men. It originates most commonly in the 2nd decade. Narcolepsy without cataplexy is an important subgroup, warranting further study.\n",
      "MOMO syndrome, previously defined as Macrosomia, Obesity, Macrocephaly, and Ocular abnormalities (OMIM 157980) is a rare intellectual disability syndrome of unknown cause. We describe two further patients with MOMO syndrome. Reported data of patients with MOMO syndrome and our own findings indicate that overgrowth does not appear to be a specific feature. We propose to form the acronym \"MOMO\" from Macrocephaly, Obesity, Mental (intellectual) disability, and Ocular abnormalities, excluding macrosomia from the syndrome name. The combination of obesity, macrocephaly, and colobomas is unique, therefore these features can be used as major diagnostic criteria of MOMO syndrome.\n",

      "The mitochondrial phosphate carrier SLC25A3 transports inorganic phosphate into the mitochondrial matrix, which is essential for the aerobic synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). We identified a homozygous mutation--c.215G-->A (p.Gly72Glu)--in the alternatively spliced exon 3A of this enzyme in two siblings with lactic acidosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and muscular hypotonia who died within the 1st year of life. Functional investigation of intact mitochondria showed a deficiency of ATP synthesis in muscle but not in fibroblasts, which correlated with the tissue-specific expression of exon 3A in muscle versus exon 3B in fibroblasts. The enzyme defect was confirmed by complementation analysis in yeast. This is the first report of patients with mitochondrial phosphate-carrier deficiency.\n",
      "We present a case of a patient with Lemierre's syndrome caused by Fusobacterium necrophorum who developed a right frontal lobe brain abscess. We summarise the epidemiology, microbiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnosis, complications, therapy, and outcomes of Lemierre's syndrome. F necrophorum is most commonly associated with Lemierre's syndrome: a septic thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein. Patients usually present with an exudative tonsillitis, sore throat, dysphagia, and unilateral neck pain. Diagnosis of septic thrombophlebitis is best confirmed by obtaining a CT scan of the neck with contrast. Complications of the disease include bacteraemia with septic abscesses to the lungs, joints, liver, peritoneum, kidneys, and brain. Treatment should include a prolonged course of intravenous beta-lactam antibiotic plus metronidazole.\n",
      "Deletions of chromosome 1p36 affect approximately 1 in 5,000 newborns and are associated with developmental delay, intellectual disability, and defects involving the brain, eye, ear, heart, and kidney. Arginine-glutamic acid dipeptide repeats (RERE) is located in the proximal 1p36 critical region. RERE is a widely-expressed nuclear receptor coregulator that positively regulates retinoic acid signaling. Animal models suggest that RERE deficiency might contribute to many of the structural and developmental birth defects and medical problems seen in individuals with 1p36 deletion syndrome, although human evidence supporting this role has been lacking. In this report, we describe ten individuals with intellectual disability, developmental delay, and/or autism spectrum disorder who carry rare and putatively damaging changes in RERE. In all cases in which both parental DNA samples were available, these changes were found to be de novo. Associated features that were recurrently seen in these individuals included hypotonia, seizures, behavioral problems, structural CNS anomalies, ophthalmologic anomalies, congenital heart defects, and genitourinary abnormalities. The spectrum of defects documented in these individuals is similar to that of a cohort of 31 individuals with isolated 1p36 deletions that include RERE and are recapitulated in RERE-deficient zebrafish and mice. Taken together, our findings suggest that mutations in RERE cause a genetic syndrome and that haploinsufficiency of RERE might be sufficient to cause many of the phenotypes associated with proximal 1p36 deletions.\n",
      "In 1985, Frydman et al. [1985: Clin Genet 27:414-419] described a syndrome characterized by growth failure, microcephaly, persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous (PHPV) with microphthalmia, cleft palate, connective tissue abnormality, mental retardation, and spastic quadriplegia. The syndrome was termed as oculo-palato-cerebral dwarfism. The first patients described were offsprings of a consanguineous couple of Moroccan Jewish descent, suggesting autosomal recessive inheritance. An additional case was reported by Pellegrino et al. [2001: Am J Med Genet 99:200-203] in 2001. The clinical features were milder than the original cases, and there was no consanguinity. We report a third patient with oculo-palato-cerebral syndrome, supporting autosomal recessive inheritance, and a detailed comparison with the previous cases. This article contains supplementary material, which may be viewed at the American Journal of Medical Genetics website at http://www.interscience.wiley.com/jpages/0148-7299/suppmat/index.html.\n",
      "Teebi hypertelorism syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant disorder that has eluded a molecular etiology since first described in 1987. Here we report on two unrelated families with a Teebi hypertelorism-like syndrome and Teebi hypertelorism phenotype who have missense mutations in Sperm Antigen With Calponin Homology And Coiled-Coil Domains (SPECC1L), previously associated with oblique facial clefting and Opitz G/BBB syndrome. The first patient and his affected mother were previously-reported by Hoffman et al. in this journal as a new syndrome resembling Teebi hypertelorism and Aarskog syndromes in 2007. This patient had hypertelorism, sagittal and coronal craniosynostosis, ptosis, natal teeth, unusual umbilicus, shawl scrotum, small hands, and feet, with grossly normal development. Our second patient had classic Teebi hypertelorism syndrome with hypertelorism and a giant umbilical hernia. Patient one and his affected mother had a c.1260G>C:p.E420D variant and patient two had a de novo c.1198_1203delATACAC:p.I400_H401del variant in SPECC1L. We review the phenotypic findings in the previously-published Teebi hypertelorism syndrome patients, and the Opitz G/BBB patients with SPECC1L mutations. In addition we emphasize the findings of aortic root dilation and craniosynostosis in these patients, which should be considered in their management.\n",
      "In 1987, Ramos-Arroyo et al. described a family with a previously unreported combination of features, which included corneal anesthesia, short stature, sensorineural deafness, learning difficulties, and a characteristic facial appearance. The family was reviewed in 2008 and additional features were noted. The name Ramos-Arroyo syndrome was proposed. The condition can be delineated by corneal anesthesia, absence of the peripapillary choriocapillaris and retinal pigment epithelium, bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, unusual facial appearance, persistent ductus arteriosus, Hirschprung disease, short stature, and intellectual disability. No other patient has been described since. Here, we report on a 5-year-old girl with features consistent with Ramos-Arroyo syndrome. We propose an overlap of this condition with dysautonomia syndromes.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE:To describe a new syndrome of X-linked myoclonic epilepsy with generalized spasticity and intellectual disability (XMESID) and identify the gene defect underlying this disorder. METHODS:The authors studied a family in which six boys over two generations had intractable seizures using a validated seizure questionnaire, clinical examination, and EEG studies. Previous records and investigations were obtained. Information on seizure disorders was obtained on 271 members of the extended family. Molecular genetic analysis included linkage studies and mutational analysis using a positional candidate gene approach. RESULTS:All six affected boys had myoclonic seizures and TCS; two had infantile spasms, but only one had hypsarrhythmia. EEG studies show diffuse background slowing with slow generalized spike wave activity. All affected boys had moderate to profound intellectual disability. Hyperreflexia was observed in obligate carrier women. A late-onset progressive spastic ataxia in the matriarch raises the possibility of late clinical manifestations in obligate carriers. The disorder was mapped to Xp11.2-22.2 with a maximum lod score of 1.8. As recently reported, a missense mutation (1058C>T/P353L) was identified within the homeodomain of the novel human Aristaless related homeobox gene (ARX). CONCLUSIONS:XMESID is a rare X-linked recessive myoclonic epilepsy with spasticity and intellectual disability in boys. Hyperreflexia is found in carrier women. XMESID is associated with a missense mutation in ARX. This disorder is allelic with X-linked infantile spasms (ISSX; MIM 308350) where polyalanine tract expansions are the commonly observed molecular defect. Mutations of ARX are associated with a wide range of phenotypes; functional studies in the future may lend insights to the neurobiology of myoclonic seizures and infantile spasms.\n",
      "A recessively inherited syndrome of blepharophimosis and ptosis with weakness of extraocular and frontal muscles is reported in six members of three related kindreds. Prognathism, synophrys and thick eyebrows added to a typical facial appearance. Additional findings included short stature, borderline head circumference and toe syndactyly. Borderline mental retardation and anosmia were found in one patient. The clinical features and the mode of inheritance distinguish this syndrome from other blepharophimosis and ptosis syndromes.\n",
      "Glucose-galactose malabsorption (GGM) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the Na(+)/glucose cotransporter gene SLC5A1 (OMIM 182380, phenotype number 606824). Patients with GGM present with neonatal onset of severe life-threatening diarrhoea and dehydration. We describe a 5-day-old girl with the typical clinical course of GGM. Our clinical diagnosis was confirmed by an abnormal chromatography of the stool and normal small bowel biopsies. Mutation analysis revealed a novel, homozygous deletion within exon 10 of the SLC5A1 gene, i.e. c.1107_1109 del AGT.\n",
      "A syndrome associated with 19q13.11 microdeletions has been proposed based on seven previous cases that displayed developmental delay, intellectual disability, speech disturbances, pre- and post-natal growth retardation, microcephaly, ectodermal dysplasia, and genital malformations in males. A 324-kb critical region was previously identified as the smallest region of overlap (SRO) for this syndrome. To further characterize this microdeletion syndrome, we present five patients with deletions within 19q12q13.12 identified using a whole-genome oligonucleotide microarray. Patients 1 and 2 possess deletions overlapping the SRO, and Patients 3-5 have deletions proximal to the SRO. Patients 1 and 2 share significant phenotypic overlap with previously reported cases, providing further definition of the 19q13.11 microdeletion syndrome phenotype, including the first presentation of ectrodactyly in the syndrome. Patients 3-5, whose features include developmental delay, growth retardation, and feeding problems, support the presence of dosage-sensitive genes outside the SRO that may contribute to the abnormal phenotypes observed in this syndrome. Multiple genotype-phenotype correlations outside the SRO are explored, including further validation of the deletion of WTIP as a candidate for male hypospadias observed in this syndrome. We postulate that unique patient-specific deletions within 19q12q13.1 may explain the phenotypic variability observed in this emerging contiguous gene deletion syndrome.\n",
      "Furuncular myiasis is likely to be seen by Western dermatologists because of the increasing number of international travelers but remains unfamiliar to most of them, who tend to refer these patients to hospitals. Different treatments have been proposed, but many of them are not achievable in outpatient consultation.We reported three typical cases of furuncular myiasis, according to each species involved, and proposed diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines for dermatologists in outpatient consultation.One patient, complaining of an inflammatory nodule of the leg with a central punctum, was diagnosed with Dermatobia hominis infection, after a forest walk in French Guiana. One woman returned from Senegal with a nodule of the left buttock. She had been infected by a Cordylobia anthropophaga larva after drying her underwear under a mango tree. One woman living in Cameroon presented with scalp nodules, pain, fatigue, and facial edema. She had been infected by more than 40 larvae of Cordylobia rodhaini after drying her sheets under a mango tree. Manual extraction ensured complete healing in the three patients. We used neither doppler ultrasound nor occlusive dressing. Diagnosis was immediately made thanks to the typical clinical stories.The diagnosis of furuncular myiasis requires only clinical skills and basic knowledge of life cycles. The treatment varies slightly depending on the species involved but is achievable in outpatient consultation and does not require occlusive dressing.\n",
      "We report on three siblings with a novel mental retardation (MR) syndrome who were born to distantly related Iranian parents. The clinical problems comprised severe MR, cataracts with onset in late adolescence, kyphosis, contractures of large joints, bulbous nose with broad nasal bridge, and thick lips. Two patients also had uni- or bilateral iris coloboma. Linkage analysis revealed a single 10.4 Mb interval of homozygosity with significant LOD score in the pericentromeric region of chromosome 4 flanked by SNPs rs728293 (4p12) and rs1105434 (4q12). This interval contains more than 40 genes, none of which has been implicated in MR so far. The identification of the causative gene defect for this syndrome will provide new insights into the development of the brain and the eye.\n",
      "Cryptophthalmos is a condition of congenital eyelid malformation most commonly accompanied by syndactyly, urogenital anomalies, and cognitive impairments as in Fraser syndrome. We report on a patient with characteristic features consistent with autosomal dominant bilateral complete isolated cryptophthalmos. This patient represents only the sixth documented case of bilateral complete isolated cryptophthalmos. Defining characteristics of this variety are discussed, including bilateral central dimpling over the globes, normal eyebrow growth, and the absence of cognitive impairment. We introduce phenotypic features that distinguish bilateral isolated cryptophthalmos from other forms and discuss its relatively favorable prognosis.\n",
      "We report on a consanguineous Arab family in which three sibs had an unusual skeletal dysplasia characterized by anterior defects of the spine leading to severe lumbar kyphosis and marked brachydactyly with cone epiphyses. The clinical phenotype also included dysmorphic facial features, epilepsy, and developmental delay. This constellation likely represents a previously undescribed skeletal dysplasia, most probably inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. A homozygosity mapping approach has thus far failed to unearth the responsible gene as the region shared by these three sibs is 27.7 Mb in size and contains over 200 genes with no obvious candidate.\n",
      "The mucolipidoses are a heterogeneous group of autosomal recessive neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorders. Mucolipidosis type IV is rare; it is seen predominantly in the Ashkenazi Jewish population and usually presents with global neurodevelopmental delays in infancy, subtle corneal opacifications or clouding, and very slowly progressive neurodegeneration over many years. Elevation of serum gastrin is reported; findings from x-rays of bone and joints and lysosomal studies are normal. Reported here are two cases of mucolipidosis type IV in children not of Ashkenazi Jewish origin who presented during infancy with nonspecific global psychomotor delays, generalized hypotonia, and mild corneal abnormalities, but remained undiagnosed for years. A rare gene mutation in MCOLN1 was confirmed in one of the two patients, in addition to abnormal serum gastrin levels. More striking was the length of time that these children eluded detection of their final diagnosis.\n",

      "PURPOSE: Nonsyndromic autosomal recessive optic atrophy (arOA) is extremely rare and its existence was disputed until a locus, optic atrophy 6 (OPA6), was mapped to 8q. Recently, a second locus, OPA7, was found on 11q in several families from North Africa, with one presumably ancestral mutation of transmembrane protein 126A (TMEM126A). Here we report an independently ascertained large consanguineous family of Moroccan descent with three siblings affected with nonsyndromic arOA. METHODS: Assuming autosomal recessive inheritance, we identified a locus on 11q with homozygosity mapping, with a multipoint logarithm of the odds score of 3.84, and sequenced two candidate genes. Direct sequencing of the complete coding sequence of TMEM126A revealed mutation p.Arg55X, homozygous in all affected siblings and heterozygous in both unaffected parents. RESULTS: This mutation was identical to that recently reported in families from North Africa, consistent with a single ancestral origin. In contrast to the recently reported patients, however, the siblings reported in this study had a relatively mild clinical course, with sudden onset in adolescence in the proband. Interestingly, the proband, but not the other affected siblings, had sensory-motor axonal neuropathy with electrophysiological data strongly suggestive of focal demyelinating abnormalities. An unaffected sibling had transient loss of vision after exercise, i.e., Uhthoff's sign of optic neuropathy, and was found to be a heterozygous carrier of the mutation. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm genetic heterogeneity in arOA, illustrate clinical variability between families with the p.Arg55X mutation including the description of a mild phenotype in a heterozygote, and underscore the implication of mitochondrial proteins in optic and peripheral neuropathy.\n",
      "Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RTS) is an autosomal dominant neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by growth deficiency, broad thumbs and great toes, intellectual disability and characteristic craniofacial appearance. Mutations in CREBBP account for around 55% of cases, with a further 8% attributed to the paralogous gene EP300. Comparatively few reports exist describing the phenotype of Rubinstein-Taybi because of EP300 mutations. Clinical and genetic data were obtained from nine patients from the UK and Ireland with pathogenic EP300 mutations, identified either by targeted testing or by exome sequencing. All patients had mild or moderate intellectual impairment. Behavioural or social difficulties were noted in eight patients, including three with autistic spectrum disorders. Typical dysmorphic features of Rubinstein-Taybi were only variably present. Additional observations include maternal pre-eclampsia (2/9), syndactyly (3/9), feeding or swallowing issues (3/9), delayed bone age (2/9) and scoliosis (2/9). Six patients had truncating mutations in EP300, with pathogenic missense mutations identified in the remaining three. The findings support previous observations that microcephaly, maternal pre-eclampsia, mild growth restriction and a mild to moderate intellectual disability are key pointers to the diagnosis of EP300-related RTS. Variability in the presence of typical facial features of Rubinstein-Taybi further highlights clinical heterogeneity, particularly among patients identified by exome sequencing. Features that overlap with Floating-Harbor syndrome, including craniofacial dysmorphism and delayed osseous maturation, were observed in three patients. Previous reports have only described mutations predicted to cause haploinsufficiency of EP300, whereas this cohort includes the first described pathogenic missense mutations in EP300.\n",

      "Most autosomal genetic causes of childhood-onset hypogammaglobulinemia are currently not well understood. Most affected individuals are simplex cases, but both autosomal-dominant and autosomal-recessive inheritance have been described. We performed genetic linkage analysis in consanguineous families affected by hypogammaglobulinemia. Four consanguineous families with childhood-onset humoral immune deficiency and features of autoimmunity shared genotype evidence for a linkage interval on chromosome 4q. Sequencing of positional candidate genes revealed that in each family, affected individuals had a distinct homozygous mutation in LRBA (lipopolysaccharide responsive beige-like anchor protein). All LRBA mutations segregated with the disease because homozygous individuals showed hypogammaglobulinemia and autoimmunity, whereas heterozygous individuals were healthy. These mutations were absent in healthy controls. Individuals with homozygous LRBA mutations had no LRBA, had disturbed B cell development, defective in vitro B cell activation, plasmablast formation, and immunoglobulin secretion, and had low proliferative responses. We conclude that mutations in LRBA cause an immune deficiency characterized by defects in B cell activation and autophagy and by susceptibility to apoptosis, all of which are associated with a clinical phenotype of hypogammaglobulinemia and autoimmunity.\n",
      "We report a new disorder with diverse neurological problems resulting from abnormal brainstem function. Consistent features of this disorder, which we propose should be called the Atabascan brainstem dysgenesis syndrome, include horizontal gaze palsy, sensorineural deafness, central hypoventilation, and developmental delay. Other features seen in some patients include swallowing dysfunction, vocal cord paralysis, facial paresis, seizures, and cardiac outflow tract anomalies. All affected children described are of Athabascan Indian heritage, with eight children from the Navajo tribe and two patients who are of Apache background. The disorder can be distinguished from the Moebius syndrome by the pattern of central nervous system findings, especially the sensorineural deafness, horizontal gaze palsy, and central hypoventilation. Recognition of children with some features of Athabascan brainstem dysgenesis syndrome should prompt investigation for other related abnormalities. Published 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.\n",
      "We report five fetuses and a child from three families who shared a phenotype comprising cerebral ventriculomegaly and echogenic kidneys with histopathological findings of congenital nephrosis. The presenting features were greatly elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) or amniotic fluid alpha-fetoprotein (AFAFP) levels or abnormalities visualized on ultrasound scan during the second trimester of pregnancy. Exome sequencing revealed deleterious sequence variants in Crumbs, Drosophila, Homolog of, 2 (CRB2) consistent with autosomal-recessive inheritance. Two fetuses with cerebral ventriculomegaly and renal microcysts were compound heterozygotes for p.Asn800Lys and p.Trp759Ter, one fetus with renal microcysts was a compound heterozygote for p.Glu643Ala and p.Asn800Lys, and one child with cerebral ventriculomegaly, periventricular heterotopias, echogenic kidneys, and renal failure was homozygous for p.Arg633Trp in CRB2. Examination of the kidneys in one fetus showed tubular cysts at the corticomedullary junction and diffuse effacement of the epithelial foot processes and microvillous transformation of the renal podocytes, findings that were similar to those reported in congenital nephrotic syndrome, Finnish type, that is caused by mutations in nephrin (NPHS1). Loss of function for crb2b and nphs1 in Danio rerio were previously shown to result in loss of the slit diaphragms of the podocytes, leading to the hypothesis that nephrosis develops from an inability to develop a functional glomerular barrier. We conclude that the phenotype associated with CRB2 mutations is pleiotropic and that the condition is an important consideration in the evaluation of high MSAFP/AFAFP where a renal cause is suspected.\n",
      "Patients with Mulibrey nanism (MUL) present with growth failure and multiple organ manifestations, and MUL is caused by mutations in TRIM37. In this article, we report on the first case series of Japanese patients with MUL who developed congestive heart failure due to constrictive pericarditis. Our case series suggests that early diagnosis and total pericardiectomy before adherence of the pericardium might provide clinical benefit and better prognosis for MUL.\n",
      "We report four new cases of the rare association of anophthalmia and esophageal atresia. There are only nine cases previously reported in the literature with this association. Our cases appear to be distinct from those already reported, thus increasing the number of cases to thirteen. Advances in developmental biology have shown that mutations in developmental genes active early in embryogenesis can lead to birth defects in multiple, seemingly unrelated systems. The network of genes that directs development has been highly conserved through evolution. Several transcription factors have been shown to be important in regulating eye development. Mutations in these developmental genes may be the cause of this clinical association.\n",
      "A 17-year-old female patient presented extreme growth failure, severe microcephaly and developmental delay, and a unique pattern of congenital anomalies, predominantly of the skeleton and the skin. Prominent findings included hidrotic ectodermal dysplasia with virtually complete absence of body hair, ichthyosiform hyperkeratosis of the skin over the lower legs, dysplasia of toenails; small hands and feet with with short fifth fingers and toes complete cutaneous syndactyly between toes 4 and 5; in X-rays, fusion of several vertebral bodies, humero-radial ankylosis, fusion between talus and navicular bone, lunate and triquetral, and proximal fusion between metacarpals 4 and 5; and luxation of the right femoral head. The patient might represent a hitherto undescribed malformation syndrome of unknown etiology.\n",
      "The frontonasal dysplasias are a group of craniofacial phenotypes characterized by hypertelorism, nasal clefting, frontal bossing, and abnormal hairline. These conditions are caused by recessive mutations in members of the aristaless gene family, resulting in abnormal cranial neural crest migration and differentiation. We report a family with a dominantly inherited craniofacial phenotype comprised of frontal bossing with high hairline, ptosis, hypertelorism, broad nasal tip, large anterior fontanelle, cranial base anomalies, and sagittal synostosis. Chromosomal microarray identified a heterozygous 108.3 kilobase deletion of chromosome 2p21 segregating with phenotype and limited to the sine oculis homeobox gene SIX2 and surrounding noncoding DNA. Similar to the human SIX2 deletion phenotype, one mouse model of frontonasal dysplasia, brachyrrhine, exhibits dominant inheritance and impaired cranial base chondrogenesis associated with reduced Six2 expression. We report the first human autosomal dominant frontonasal dysplasia syndrome associated with SIX2 deletion and with phenotypic similarities to murine models of Six2 Loss-of-function.\n",
      "A new familial syndrome that affected 3 of 7 siblings is described. All 3 patients were young women with a very peculiar phenotype, poikilodermia and hair greying, and idiopathic nonarteriosclerotic cerebral calcifications. Pathological studies demonstrated a marked and progressive hyalinosis involving capillaries and often arterioles and small veins of the digestive tract, kidneys, and calcified areas of the brain. Using electron microscopy, we found that the hyalin substance in the intestinal capillaries consisted of several concentric layers of basal membrane-like deposits within a finely granular fluffy material. Huge deposits of this material were present in the subepithelial and mesangial spaces of the kidneys. Endothelial cells and, in the kidneys, mesangial cells were markedly abnormal, and a true mesangiolysis pattern was present in 2 patients. The clinical and biologic expression of these vascular changes was variable. Diarrhea, rectal bleeding, malabsorption, and protein-losing enteropathy were the main and lethal clinical problems in the proband. Hypertension appeared in the early stage of a second pregnancy in 1 sister, and mild proteinuria was found in all 3 affected patients. Peripheral retinal ischemic syndrome and chorioretinal scars were found in the ocular fundi of both affected sisters of the proband. A subarachnoid hemorrhage, due to a right sylvian aneurism, also occurred in both sisters and was lethal in 1 sister. None of the known causes of distal vessel hyalinosis could be ascertained.\n",
      "X-linked mental retardation has been traditionally divided into syndromic (S-XLMR) and non-syndromic forms (NS-XLMR), although the borderlines between these phenotypes begin to vanish and mutations in a single gene, for example PQBP1, can cause S-XLMR as well as NS-XLMR. Here, we report two maternal cousins with an apparently X-linked phenotype of mental retardation (MR), microphthalmia, choroid coloboma, microcephaly, renal hypoplasia, and spastic paraplegia. By multipoint linkage analysis with markers spanning the entire X-chromosome we mapped the disease locus to a 28-Mb interval between Xp11.4 and Xq12, including the BCOR gene. A missense mutation in BCOR was described in a family with Lenz microphthalmia syndrome, a phenotype showing substantial overlapping features with that described in the two cousins. However, no mutation in the BCOR gene was found in both patients. Subsequent mutation analysis of PQBP1, located within the delineated linkage interval in Xp11.23, revealed a 2-bp deletion, c.461_462delAG, that cosegregated with the disease. Notably, the same mutation is associated with the Hamel cerebropalatocardiac syndrome, another form of S-XLMR. Haplotype analysis suggests a germline mosaicism of the 2-bp deletion in the maternal grandmother of both affected individuals. In summary, our findings demonstrate for the first time that mutations in PQBP1 are associated with an S-XLMR phenotype including microphthalmia, thereby further extending the clinical spectrum of phenotypes associated with PQBP1 mutations.\n",
      "Ankyrin-G, encoded by ANK3, plays an important role in neurodevelopment and neuronal function. There are multiple isoforms of Ankyrin-G resulting in differential tissue expression and function. Heterozygous missense mutations in ANK3 have been associated with autism spectrum disorder. Further, in three siblings a homozygous frameshift mutation affecting only the longest isoform and a patient with a balanced translocation disrupting all isoforms were documented. The latter four patients were affected by a variable degree of intellectual disability, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism. Here, we report on a boy with speech impairment, intellectual disability, autistic features, macrocephaly, macrosomia, chronic hunger and an altered sleeping pattern. By trio-whole-exome sequencing, we identified the first de novo nonsense mutation affecting all ANK3 transcripts. Thus, our data expand the phenotype of ANK3-associated diseases and suggest an isoform-based, phenotypic continuum between dominant and recessive ANK3-associated pathologies.\n",
      "CONTEXT: GLUT1 (glucose transporter 1) deficiency syndrome is a well-known presentation in pediatric practice. Very rare mutations not only disable carbohydrate transport but also cause the red cell membrane to be constitutively permeant to monovalent cations, namely sodium and potassium. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to describe the pediatric presentation of a patient with GLUT1 deficiency with such a cation-leaky state. SUBJECT AND METHODS: The infant presented with erratic hyperkalemia, neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, anemia, hepatic dysfunction, and microcephaly. Later, seizures occurred and developmental milestones were delayed. Magnetic resonance imaging and computerized tomography scans of the brain showed multiple abnormalities including periventricular calcification. Visual impairment was present due to the presence of both cataracts and retinal dysfunction. RESULTS: Measurements of red cell cation content showed extremely leaky red cells (causing the hemolysis) and temperature-dependent loss of potassium from red cells (explaining the hyperkalemia as pseudohyperkalemia). A trinucleotide deletion in SLC2A1, coding for the deletion of isoleucine 435 or 436 in GLUT1, was identified in the proband. CONCLUSION: This is the fourth pedigree to be described with this most unusual syndrome. The multisystem pathology probably reflects a combination of glucose transport deficiency at the blood-brain barrier (as in typical GLUT1 deficiency) and the deleterious osmotic effects of a cation-leaky membrane protein in the cells where GLUT1 is expressed, notably the red cell. We hope that this detailed description will facilitate rapid diagnosis of this disease entity.\n",
      "This is the first report of a syndrome of aniridia and aplasia of the patella. The origin of the defect arises spontaneously in the grandmother of the proband and must be assumed to be a de novo mutation. There is no associated chromosomal abnormality or overt biochemical or other somatic defect. This is an extremely rare mutation exhibiting a dominant autosomal form of inheritance. The gene for aniridia is a dominant gene whose penetrance here is 100%. The combination of aniridia and bone malformations in general is very rare. This linked defect probably represents one of the most rare of human genetic abnormalities. The penetrance of the combined abnormality seems to follow that of the more well-known aniridia gene.\n",
      "Congenital anonychia is rare, particularly when all 10 toenails are absent. When anonychia is associated with absence of distal phalanges, a diagnosis of Cooks syndrome must be considered. We present a case and discussion of a patient with congenital anonychia, absent distal phalanges, and rudimentary hypoplastic middle phalanges and brachydactyly, consistent with Cooks syndrome.\n",
      "We evaluated a patient with mild intellectual disability, obesity, overgrowth, and dysmorphic features. Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) analysis showed a single copy number increase of a BAC clone in the 11p15.4 region. Oligonucleotide aCGH refined the duplication to approximately 2.29√¢‚Ç¨‚Ä∞ megabases (Mb) in size. Testing the parents revealed that the father, who had learning disabilities and overgrowth, also had the 11p15.4 duplication, and the mother had a normal microarray. In addition, the patient's brother and grandmother all share clinical features with the proband and tested positive for the duplication. The duplicated region (Chr11:6,934,067-9,220,605) encompasses 29 genes, including the ZNF214 gene, which has been postulated to play a role in Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome [Alders et al., 2000]. This three-generation pedigree outlines features of a novel microduplication syndrome.\n",
      "This study concerns an apparently lethal and previously undescribed syndrome of hypoplastic corpus callosum, microcephaly, severe mental retardation, preauricular skin tag, camptodactyly, growth retardation, and recurrent bronchopneumonia. This combination of anomalies is probably inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. A brief literature review of the anomalies or syndromes associated with callosal defects is discussed.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: To report a case of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) in a child and review the existing literature of LEMS in children. METHODS: We report a pediatric case of LEMS with the classic clinical triad of proximal weakness, autonomic dysfunction, and areflexia; the characteristic increment in compound motor action potential on high-frequency repetitive nerve stimulation; and positive serum P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channel antibodies. Only 11 pediatric cases of LEMS have been reported in the literature. RESULTS: The patient's presentation with LEMS led to the diagnosis of occult neuroblastoma. Based on review of the existing pediatric literature, no consistent clinical or electrodiagnostic criteria exist to diagnose LEMS in children. CONCLUSIONS: There exists a need for consistent clinical criteria and electrodiagnostic testing for prompt diagnosis of LEMS in children. Prompt identification of LEMS will alert the physician to search for malignancy or another immune-mediated process.\n",
      "Brooks, Wisniewski, and Brown described a familial presentation of severe developmental retardation, speech delay, static encephalopathy with atrophic hydrocephalus, microcephaly, progressive spastic diplegia, a characteristic facial appearance, optic atrophy, and growth retardation associated with hypoplastic corpus callosum in one of the patients. The authors postulated a distinct X-linked mental retardation syndrome. Later on a similar phenotype was observed in three male siblings with an early lethal outcome. Here we describe three patients with several overlapping features and a progressive neurological picture presenting with a significantly compromised mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation measured in a fresh muscle biopsy. Neurological deterioration is a commonly observed feature in mitochondrial disorders. Based on the unique combination of the clinical symptoms, we suggest that our patients have the Brooks-Wisniewski-Brown syndrome.\n",
      "Tetrasomy 9p is a generic term describing the presence of a supernumerary chromosome incorporating two copies of the 9p arm. Two varieties exist: isodicentric chromosome 9p (i(9p)), where the two 9p arms are linked by a single centromeric region, and pseudodicentric 9p (idic(9p)), where one active and one inactive centromere are linked together by a proximal segment of 9q that may incorporate euchromatic material. In living patients, i(9p) and idic(9p) are usually present in a mosaic state. Fifty-four cases, including fetuses, have been reported, of which only two have been molecularly characterized using array-CGH. Tetrasomy 9p leads to a variable phenotype ranging from multiple congenital anomalies with severe intellectual disability and growth delay to subnormal cognitive and physical developments. Hypertelorism, abnormal ears, microretrognathia and bulbous nose are the most common dysmorphic traits. Microcephaly, growth retardation, joint dislocation, scoliosis, cardiac and renal anomalies were reported in several cases. Those physical anomalies are often, but not universally, accompanied by intellectual disability. The most recurrent breakpoints, defined by conventional cytogenetics, are 9p10, 9q12 and 9q13. We report on 12 new patients with tetrasomy 9p (3 i(9p), 8 idic(9p) and one structurally uncharacterized), including the first case of parental germline mosaicism. All rearrangements have been characterized by DNA microarray. Based on our results and a review of the literature, we further delineate the prenatal and postnatal clinical spectrum of this imbalance. Our results show poor genotype-phenotype correlations and underline the need of precise molecular characterization of the supernumerary marker.\n",
      "Teebi-Shaltout syndrome (TSS) was first reported by Teebi and Shaltout in 1989. This entity is proposed to be inherited in autosomal recessive manner. The clinical features include characteristic facial features, ectodermal dysplasia, camptodactyly, and caudal appendage. Only one additional paper reporting four additional cases has been published since the first description. Clinical features common to all previously affected individuals diagnosed with TSS are craniofacial, orodental-ectodermal, and skeletal. This report summarizes and discusses the findings of three additional patients from two unrelated families with findings similar to TSS. These findings may be present in a genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous group of disorders similar to TSS. Presence of consanguinity and similarly affected siblings of both genders suggests autosomal recessive inheritance.\n",
      "Richieri-Costa and Pereira syndrome, described in 1992, comprises short stature, Robin sequence, cleft mandible, limb malformations, and short larynx, deformed or lack of epiglottis, and abnormal aryepiglottic folds. There are 32 reported cases, only one described outside Brazil. We describe a 4-month-old boy with the most severe phenotype yet reported.\n",
      "We report on two brothers, born to double first cousin Jordanian Arab parents, with a syndrome comprising severe hypertelorism with upslanted palpebral fissures, brachycephaly, abnormal ears, sloping shoulders, enamel hypoplasia, and osteopenia with repeated fractures. Both have severe myopia, mild to moderate sensori-neural hearing loss and borderline intelligence. Results of chromosome analysis were normal as was a FISH assay for subtelomeric rearrangements. The father has mild hypertelorism but the family history is otherwise unremarkable. We think that this represents a previously unrecognized autosomal or X-linked recessive syndrome.\n",
      "Array-CGH enables the detection of submicroscopic chromosomal deletions and duplications and leads to an accurate delineation of the imbalances, raising the possibility of genotype to phenotype and mapping minimal critical regions associated with particular patterns of clinical features. We report here on four patients sharing common clinical features (psychomotor retardation, coarse facies and ocular anomalies), with proximal 5q deletions identified by oligo array-CGH. The deletions range from 5.75 to 17.26-Mb in size and occurred de novo. A common 2.63-Mb region between the deletions described here can be defined in 5q12.1 (59,390,122-62,021,754‚Äâbp from 5pter, hg18) and includes 12 genes. Among them, KIF2A, which encodes a kinesin superfamily protein, is a particularly interesting candidate for the phenotype, as it suppresses the growth of axonal collateral branches and is involved in normal brain development. Ocular defects, albeit unspecific, seem to be common in the 5q12.1 deletion. Identification of additional cases of deletions involving the 5q12.1 region will allow more accurate genotype-phenotype correlations.\n",
      "C12orf65 participates in the process of mitochondrial translation and has been shown to be associated with a spectrum of phenotypes, including early onset optic atrophy, progressive encephalomyopathy, peripheral neuropathy, and spastic paraparesis.We used whole-genome homozygosity mapping as well as exome sequencing and targeted gene sequencing to identify novel C12orf65 disease-causing mutations in seven affected individuals originating from two consanguineous families. In four family members affected with childhood-onset optic atrophy accompanied by slowly progressive peripheral neuropathy and spastic paraparesis, we identified a homozygous frame shift mutation c.413_417 delAACAA, which predicts a truncated protein lacking the C-terminal portion. In the second family, we studied three affected individuals who presented with early onset optic atrophy, peripheral neuropathy, and spastic gait in addition to moderate intellectual disability. Muscle biopsy in two of the patients revealed decreased activities of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes I and IV. In these patients, we identified a homozygous splice mutation, g.21043‚ÄâT>A (c.282+2‚ÄâT>A) which leads to skipping of exon 2. Our study broadens the phenotypic spectrum of C12orf65 defects and highlights the triad of optic atrophy, axonal neuropathy and spastic paraparesis as its key clinical features. In addition, a clear genotype-phenotype correlation is anticipated in which deleterious mutations which disrupt the GGQ-containing domain in the first coding exon are expected to result in a more severe phenotype, whereas down-stream C-terminal mutations may result in a more favorable phenotype, typically lacking cognitive impairment.\n",
      "This paper describes a family in which members of two generations have an X-linked type of enamel dysplasia. All affected persons have symmetric pits in the cuticles of their hair shafts. The observation of these concurrent traits raises questions about the classification of amelogenesis imperfecta and the value of microscopic studies of the hair in the persons with purported isolated enamel dysplasias.\n",
      "Thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) is an essential cofactor of the cytosolic transketolase and of three mitochondrial enzymes involved in the¬†oxidative decarboxylation of either pyruvate, Œ±-ketoglutarate or branched chain amino acids. Thiamine is taken up by specific transporters into the cell and converted to the active TPP by thiamine pyrophosphokinase (TPK) in the cytosol from where it can be transported into mitochondria. Here, we report five individuals from three families presenting with variable degrees of ataxia, psychomotor retardation, progressive dystonia, and lactic acidosis. Investigation of the mitochondrial energy metabolism showed reduced oxidation of pyruvate but normal pyruvate dehydrogenase complex activity in the presence of excess TPP. A reduced concentration of TPP was found in the muscle and blood. Mutation analysis of TPK1 uncovered three missense, one splice-site, and one frameshift mutation resulting in decreased TPK protein levels.\n",
      "We studied 10 members of a 4 generation Missouri kindred with a dominant mental retardation syndrome with increasing severity in males. The 21 year-old propositus presented with severe mental retardation, microcephaly, asymmetric face, exotropia, hypogonadism, joint hypermobility, rocker bottom feet, and 10 low digital arches. Two brothers and a male cousin had similar features. The mother, sister, niece, maternal aunt, female cousin, and grandmother were examined and each had 8 to 10 low digital arches. Five of the women had exotropia and one had pes cavus feet. Chromosome analysis for fragile X in multiple relatives was normal. To determine the likelihood that this was an X-linked syndrome. DNA from relatives was hybridized to probes which detect 13 different loci spanning the X-chromosome. A peak LOD score of 2.78 at theta equal to 0.0 was calculated for the syndrome locus and DXYS1 (pDP34). The more distal Xq loci showed increasing recombination with the syndrome locus. These results are consistent with location for this syndrome near Xq21.31, the chromosomal locus for DXYSI.\n",
      "Liddle syndrome is an inherited form of low-renin hypertension, transmitted with an autosomal dominant pattern. The molecular basis of Liddle syndrome resides in germline mutations of the SCNN1A, SCNN1B and SCNN1G genes, encoding the Œ±, Œ≤, and Œ≥-subunits of the epithelial Na‚Å∫ channel (ENaC), respectively. To date, 31 different causative mutations have been reported in 72 families from four continents. The majority of the substitutions cause an increased expression of the channel at the distal nephron apical membrane, with subsequent enhanced renal sodium reabsorption. The most common clinical presentation of the disease is early onset hypertension, hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, suppressed plasma renin activity and low plasma aldosterone. Consequently, treatment of Liddle syndrome is based on the administration of ENaC blockers, amiloride and triamterene. Herein, we discuss the genetic basis, clinical presentation, diagnosis and treatment of Liddle syndrome. Finally, we report a new case in an Italian family, caused by a SCNN1B p.Pro618Leu substitution.\n",
      "Nemaline myopathy commonly presents with symmetrical proximal weakness. Here we report two cases of nemaline myopathy presenting with distal dominant involvement with prominent asymmetry. Case 1 was a 37-year-old man who recalled frequently falling down and had right calf atrophy since he was 3-years-old. He had right calf muscle atrophy and weakness and steppage gait; his cardiopulmonary function was normal. Case 2 was a 35-year-old man with right calf muscle atrophy and weakness since childhood. He had right dominant distal leg weakness and atrophy together with respiratory failure and started noninvasive positive pressure ventilation. He also developed cardiomyopathy and died from acute respiratory failure due to pneumonia at age 39. Both cases harbored compound heterozygous nebulin (NEB) mutations with c.20131 C>T:p.Arg6711Trp and a nonsense mutation. Nemaline myopathy associated with NEB mutations can present as distal dominant myopathy with prominent asymmetry.\n",
      "The short arm of chromosome 16 is rich in segmental duplications that result in chromosomal rearrangements through non-allelic homologous recombination. Several syndromes resulting from microdeletions or microduplications in this region have been reported. The chromosome 16p12.2-p11.2 deletion syndrome, 7.1- to 8.7-Mb [OMIM#613604] is characterized by minor facial anomalies, feeding difficulties, a significant delay in speech development, and recurrent ear infections. Reciprocal duplications of 16p12.2-p11.2 have been reported in some patients with autism. We identified a patient with a 16p12.2-p11.2 deletion and a patient with a 16p12.2-p11.2 duplication using oligonucleotide SNP array. The patient with the deletion showed severe developmental delay without autism. The patient with the deletion shared clinical features with previously reported patients. The patient with the duplication showed mild developmental delay and autism. She had dysmorphic features including a round face, a large mouth, and relative macrocephaly. We reviewed the reports of the two syndromes and compared the clinical manifestations. The 16p12.2-p11.2 duplication syndrome is a new syndrome with autism spectral disorders and dysmorphic features.\n",
      "We report on a father and son who have telecanthus, hypertelorism, strabismus, and pes cavus.

      "Adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency is a rare autosomal disorder of de novo purine synthesis, which results in the accumulation of succinylpurines in body fluids. Patients with adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency show a variable combination of mental retardation, epilepsy and autistic features and are usually discovered during screens for unexplained encephalopathy using the Bratton-Marshall assay that reveals the excretion of the succinylaminoimidazolecarboxamide riboside (SAICAr). Here, we report on two sisters aged 11 and 12 years presented with global developmental delay, motor apraxia, severe speech deficits, seizures and behavioural features, which combined excessive laughter, a very happy disposition, hyperactivity, a short attention span, the mouthing of objects, tantrums and stereotyped movements that gave a behavioural profile mimicking Angelman syndrome. Both patients had an increased succinyladenosine/SAICAr ratio of 1.6, and exhibited a novel homozygous missense mutation (c.674T>C; p.Met225Thr) in the exon 6 of the ADSL gene. We suggest that these clinical features might be a new presentation of adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency. On the basis of this observation, although adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency is a rare disorder, this diagnosis should be considered in patients with mental retardation and a behavioural profile suggestive of Angelman syndrome.\n",
      "Two brothers whose parents are second cousins have short stature, femoral epiphyseal dysplasia, umbilical and inguinal herniae, sensorineural deafness and developmental delay.

      "Inherited, complete deficiency of human HOIL-1, a component of the linear ubiquitination chain assembly complex (LUBAC), underlies autoinflammation, infections, and amylopectinosis. We report the clinical description and molecular analysis of a novel inherited disorder of the human LUBAC complex. A patient with multiorgan autoinflammation, combined immunodeficiency, subclinical amylopectinosis, and systemic lymphangiectasia, is homozygous for a mutation in HOIP, the gene encoding the catalytic component of LUBAC. The missense allele (L72P, in the PUB domain) is at least severely hypomorphic, as it impairs HOIP expression and destabilizes the whole LUBAC complex. Linear ubiquitination and NF-Œ∫B activation are impaired in the patient's fibroblasts stimulated by IL-1Œ≤ or TNF. In contrast, the patient's monocytes respond to IL-1Œ≤ more vigorously than control monocytes. However, the activation and differentiation of the patient's B cells are impaired in response to CD40 engagement. These cellular and clinical phenotypes largely overlap those of HOIL-1-deficient patients. Clinical differences between HOIL-1- and HOIP-mutated patients may result from differences between the mutations, the loci, or other factors. Our findings show that human HOIP is essential for the assembly and function of LUBAC and for various processes governing inflammation and immunity in both hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cells.\n",
      "A 57-year-old black man had Fran√ßois-Neetens speckled dystrophy of the cornea and orbital phycomycosis. Examination of family members confirmed an auto-somal-dominant pattern of inheritance. Light and electron microscopic study of the cornea of a blind eye disclosed that the corneal opacities were represented by swollen, vacuolated keratocytes filled with histochemically demonstrable acid mucopolysaccharide and complex lipids. Thus, this dystrophy may represent a dominantly inherited metabolic disorder confined to the cornea.\n",
      "We show that haploinsufficiency of KANSL1 is sufficient to cause the 17q21.31 microdeletion syndrome, a multisystem disorder characterized by intellectual disability, hypotonia and distinctive facial features. The KANSL1 protein is an evolutionarily conserved regulator of the chromatin modifier KAT8, which influences gene expression through histone H4 lysine 16 (H4K16) acetylation. RNA sequencing studies in cell lines derived from affected individuals and the presence of learning deficits in Drosophila melanogaster mutants suggest a role for KANSL1 in neuronal processes.\n",
      "The recent identification of multiple dominant mutations in the gene encoding Œ≤-catenin in both humans and mice has enabled exploration of the molecular and cellular basis of Œ≤-catenin function in cognitive impairment. In humans, Œ≤-catenin mutations that cause a spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders have been identified. We identified de novo Œ≤-catenin mutations in patients with intellectual disability, carefully characterized their phenotypes, and were able to define a recognizable intellectual disability syndrome. In parallel, characterization of a chemically mutagenized mouse line that displays features similar to those of human patients with Œ≤-catenin mutations enabled us to investigate the consequences of Œ≤-catenin dysfunction through development and into adulthood. The mouse mutant, designated batface (Bfc), carries a Thr653Lys substitution in the C-terminal armadillo repeat of Œ≤-catenin and displayed a reduced affinity for membrane-associated cadherins. In association with this decreased cadherin interaction, we found that the mutation results in decreased intrahemispheric connections, with deficits in dendritic branching, long-term potentiation, and cognitive function. Our study provides in vivo evidence that dominant mutations in Œ≤-catenin underlie losses in its adhesion-related functions, which leads to severe consequences, including intellectual disability, childhood hypotonia, progressive spasticity of lower limbs, and abnormal craniofacial features in adults.\n",
      "A previously undescribed syndrome with profound sensorineural hearing loss since early infancy, episodes of dizziness, and hypodontia developed in a brother and sister. The presence of two unaffected children and unaffected parents suggests autosomal recessive inheritance.\n",
      "Pontocerebellar hypoplasia (PCH) can occur as an isolated entity or part of a syndrome. PCH has been reported with facial dysmorphism, ocular anomalies, and genital anomalies, but the co-occurrence of all four has not been previously described. We report on four patients, born to two consanguineous families that are not related to one another, with distinctive facial features (short forehead, laterally extended, medially flared eyebrows), corneal dystrophy, underdevelopment of labioscrotal folds, and nonprogressive PCH. In addition, the patients show hair extruding from the lactiferous ducts, which to our knowledge has not been described before. The parental consanguinity, affected siblings of both genders, and absent manifestations in parents, indicate an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance as most likely. ¬© 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Nineteen patients with deletions in chromosome 6p22-p24 have been published so far. The syndromic phenotype is varied, and includes intellectual disability, behavioural abnormalities, dysmorphic features and structural organ defects. Heterogeneous deletion breakpoints and sizes (1-17 Mb) and overlapping phenotypes have made the identification of the disease causing genes challenging. We suggest JARID2 and ATXN1, both harbored in 6p22.3, as disease causing genes. METHODS AND RESULTS: We describe five unrelated patients with de novo deletions (0.1-4.8 Mb in size) in chromosome 6p22.3-p24.1 detected by aCGH in a cohort of approximately 3600 patients ascertained for neurodevelopmental disorders. Two patients (Patients 4 and 5) carried non-overlapping deletions that were encompassed by the deletions of the remaining three patients (Patients 1-3), indicating the existence of two distinct dosage sensitive genes responsible for impaired cognitive function in 6p22.3 deletion-patients. The smallest region of overlap (SRO I) in Patients 1-4 (189 kb) included the genes JARID2 and DTNBP1, while SRO II in Patients 1-3 and 5 (116 kb) contained GMPR and ATXN1. Patients with deletion of SRO I manifested variable degrees of cognitive impairment, gait disturbance and distinct, similar facial dysmorphic features (prominent supraorbital ridges, deep set eyes, dark infraorbital circles and midface hypoplasia) that might be ascribed to the haploinsufficiency of JARID2. Patients with deletion of SRO II showed intellectual disability and behavioural abnormalities, likely to be caused by the deletion of ATXN1. Patients 1-3 presented with lower cognitive function than Patients 4 and 5, possibly due to the concomitant haploinsufficiency of both ATXN1 and JARID2. The chromatin modifier genes ATXN1 and JARID2 are likely candidates contributing to the clinical phenotype in 6p22-p24 deletion-patients. Both genes exert their effect on the Notch signalling pathway, which plays an important role in several developmental processes. CONCLUSIONS: Patients carrying JARID2 deletion manifested with cognitive impairment, gait disturbance and a characteristic facial appearance, whereas patients with deletion of ATXN1 seemed to be characterized by intellectual disability and behavioural abnormalities. Due to the characteristic facial appearance, JARID2 haploinsufficiency might represent a clinically recognizable neurodevelopmental syndrome.\n",
      "Congenital disorders of Glycosylation (CDG) are increasingly emerging as a major underlying etiology for patients with complex neurogenetic malformations and dysmorphic features. We describe a newborn female with arthrogryposis multiplex due to fetal akinesia secondary to CDG-DPAGT1. Pregnancy was complicated by reduced fetal movements. At birth, the patient was evaluated for intrauterine growth restriction, bilateral cataracts, and multiple joint contractures. She had markedly reduced spontaneous movements, hypotonia, weak cry, and poor suck. She had ventilator-dependent central respiratory depression. Brain MRI showed delayed myelination and an incomplete cerebellar vermis. Transferrin isoelectric focusing was suggestive of a type I congenital disorder of glycosylation. Sequencing revealed a homozygous missense mutation in dolichyl-phosphate N-acetylglucosaminephosphotransferase (DPAGT1), exon 3, p.Leu118Val, consistent with DPAGT1-CDG. There have been seventeen previously reported cases of DPAGT1-CDG, including two similar cases with multiple contractures. This case highlights the importance of considering congenital disorders of glycosylation in the differential diagnosis for arthrogryposis.\n",
      "Two sibs with a similar pattern of unusual facial features, limb malformations, and postnatal onset of ichthyosis are reported. The parents are first cousins and neither shows any stigmata of the disorder. The presence of ichthyosis suggests that there may be a metabolic component to this syndrome. In view of the consanguinity and pattern of the malformations, autosomal recessive inheritance seems likely.\n",
      "Punctate keratoderma and spastic paralysis occurred in three generations of a family. Several members had keratoderma of the palms and soles or spastic paralysis or both. The family history was consistent with autosomal-dominant inheritance. The age at onset and the rate of progression of symptoms were variable. The concurrence of these lesions can be interpreted to mean either that the keratoderma and the paraplegia are the pleiotropic effects of the same mutant gene or, less likely, that they are the manifestations of two different autosomal mutations segregating in this family. We are not aware of a similar syndrome having been previously reported.\n",
      "Inherited ataxias are an extremely heterogeneous group of disorders. Autosomal recessive spinocerebellar ataxia 20 (SCAR20) is a recently described disorder characterized by intellectual disability, ataxia, coarse facial features, progressive loss of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum and often hearing loss and skeletal abnormalities. Mutations in the gene SNX14, which plays an important role in autophagy, have been found to cause SCAR20. The unique clinical findings of progressive coarsening of facial features makes the clinical phenotype recognizable among the various hereditary ataxias. Here we report on a child with a novel missense mutation in the SNX14 gene that appears to be debilitating for protein conformation, function and review the previously reported cases from 15 families.\n",
      "Two female sibs aged 15 and 18 years with microcephaly, mental retardation and marfanoid habitus who developed focal segmental glomerulonephritis leading to renal failure are described. This combination of features appears to represent a unique syndrome distinct from previous reports of microcephaly in association with the nephrotic syndrome. The mode of inheritance is likely to be autosomal recessive.\n",
      "CLOVES syndrome characterized by Congenital Lipomatous Overgrowth, Vascular malformations, Epidermal nevi, and Skeletal anomalies is a recently described sporadic syndrome from postzygotic activating mutations in PIK3CA. This 3-year-old boy, born to nonconsanguineous and healthy parents, had epidermal verrucous nevus, lower limb length discrepancy and bilateral genuvalgum, anterior abdominal wall lipomatous mass, central beaking of L2 and L3, and fibrous dysplasia of the left frontal bone. Ocular and dental abnormalities (ptosis, esotropia, delayed canine eruption, dental hypoplasia), ipsilateral asymmetrical deformity of skull, and large left cerebral hemisphere with mild ipsilateral ventriculomegaly were peculiar to him denoting an uncommon phenotype. The parents did not consent for magnetic resonance imaging and genetic studies because of financial constraints. The CLOVES syndrome has emerged as an uncommon yet distinct clinical entity with some phenotypic variations. Its diagnosis is usually from cutaneous, truncal, spinal, and foot anomalies in clinical and radioimaging studies. Proteus syndrome remains the major differential.\n",
      "Ficolin-3, encoded by the FCN3 gene and expressed in the lung and liver, is a recognition molecule in the lectin pathway of the complement system. Heterozygosity for an FCN3 frameshift mutation (rs28357092), leading to a distortion of the C-terminal end of the molecule, occurs in people without disease (allele frequency among whites, 0.01). We describe a patient with recurrent infections who was homozygous for this mutation, who had undetectable serum levels of ficolin-3, and who had a deficiency in ficolin-3-dependent complement activation.\n",
      "The conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex is involved in intra-Golgi retrograde trafficking, and mutations in six of its eight subunits have been reported in congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG). Here we report a patient showing severe acquired microcephaly, psychomotor retardation, seizures, liver dysfunction, hypocupremia, and hypoceruloplasminemia. Analysis of his serum glycoproteins revealed defects in both sialylation and galactosylation of glycan termini. Trio-based whole-exome sequencing identified two heterozygous mutations in COG2: a de novo frameshift mutation [c.701dup (p.Tyr234*)] and a missense mutation [c.1900T‚Äâ>‚ÄâG (p.Trp634Gly)]. Sequencing of cloned reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) products revealed that both mutations were located on separate alleles, as expected, and that the mutant transcript harboring the frameshift mutation underwent degradation. The c.1900T‚Äâ>‚ÄâG (p.Trp634Gly) mutation is located in a domain highly conserved among vertebrates and was absent from both the public database and our control exomes. Protein expression of COG2, along with COG3 and COG4, was decreased in fibroblasts from the patient. Our data strongly suggest that these compound heterozygous mutations in COG2 are causative of CDG.\n",
      "The Buschke-Ollendorff syndrome (BOS) is a rare connective tissue disorder inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern characterized by cutaneous lesions, dermatofibrosis lenticularis disseminata, and osteopoikilosis. We report a new case of this syndrome in a 66 year old man, interesting by its association with a protein C deficiency, another rare genetically transmitted disease. Diagnosis of the BOS is difficult on the mere cutaneous lesions; it is therefore important to systematically practice bone X-rays in the presence of atypical pseudoxanthoma elasticum, disseminated collagenoma or disseminated connective tissue or elastic nevi. The radiologically detectable osteopoikilotic bone lesions, evoking Paget's disease, easily sign the diagnosis. In our case, the association of a protein C deficiency with the BOS may not be fortuitous because both the elastin and protein C genes are localized on chromosome 2q.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Single-gene disorders related to ischemic stroke seem to be an important cause of stroke in young patients without known risk factors. To identify new genes responsible of such diseases, we studied a consanguineous Moroccan family with three affected individuals displaying hereditary leucoencephalopathy with ischemic stroke, dysmorphic syndrome and retinitis pigmentosa that appears to segregate in autosomal recessive pattern. METHODS: All family members underwent neurological and radiological examinations. A genome wide search was conducted in this family using the ABI PRISM linkage mapping set version 2.5 from Applied Biosystems. Six candidate genes within the region linked to the disease were screened for mutations by direct sequencing. RESULTS: Evidence of linkage was obtained on chromosome 17q24.2-25.3. Analysis of recombination events and LOD score calculation suggests linkage of the responsible gene in a genetic interval of 11 Mb located between D17S789 and D17S1806 with a maximal multipoint LOD score of 2.90. Sequencing of seven candidate genes in this locus, ATP5H, FDXR, SLC25A19, MCT8, CYGB, KCNJ16 and GRIN2C, identified three missense mutations in the FDXR gene which were also found in a homozygous state in three healthy controls, suggesting that these variants are not disease-causing mutations in the family. CONCLUSION: A novel locus for leucoencephalopathy with ischemic stroke, dysmorphic syndrome and retinitis pigmentosa has been mapped to chromosome 17q24.2-25.3 in a consanguineous Moroccan family.\n",
      "Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) is now commonly used to identify copy number changes in individuals with developmental delay, intellectual disabilities, autism spectrum disorders, and/or multiple congenital anomalies. We report on an infant with multiple congenital anomalies and a novel 2.6 Mb interstitial deletion within 9q21.32q21.33 detected by aCGH. Her clinical presentation included dysmorphic craniofacial features, cleft palate, atrial septal defect, bicornuate uterus, bilateral hip dislocation, hypotonia, and recurrent pneumonia. Parental aCGH studies were negative for copy loss in this region. To our knowledge, no similar deletions have been reported in available databases or published literature. This deletion encompasses 12 genes, and prediction algorithms as well as experimental data suggest that a subset is likely to be haploinsufficient. Included are a neurotrophin receptor (NKG2D), a gene implicated in cilia function (KIF27), an adaptor protein important for ubiquitin-dependent protein quality control (UBQLN1), a gene important for transcription and signaling (HNRNPK), and a gene involved in maintaining genomic stability (RMI1). Identifying additional patients with similar copy losses and further study of these genes will contribute to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of multiple congenital anomalies.\n",
      "We describe clinical, biochemical, pathological, and spectroscopic findings in 4 women, aged 15 to 29 years, from three unrelated families who had a unique combination of a central nervous system white matter disease and primary ovarian failure. All had normal initial development but 3 had borderline low IQ and academic difficulties in primary school. Puberty did not develop in 2 patients and was arrested in a third patient. The fourth patient had premature ovarian failure at the age of 13 years. Head magnetic resonance imaging showed diffuse white matter disease, with frontal cortical atrophy in the most clinically advanced patient. All patients had normal karyotype and normal findings on extensive evaluations for known leukodystrophies, for other metabolic diseases, and for causes of ovarian failure. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging showed reduction of choline-containing compounds in the affected white matter in all patients and reduction of N-acetylaspartate in the unaffected frontal white matter of 2 patients. All patients had evidence of primary gonadal insufficiency with a normal hypothalamic-hypophyseal axis. Pathological analysis showed streak ovaries in 1 patient and signs of hypomyelination, and gliosis on brain biopsy in another patient. In conclusion, we present a novel group of patients who have in common leukodystrophy, primary ovarian dysfunction, and magnetic resonance spectroscopic abnormalities.\n",
      "PURPOSE: Therapy for central nervous system (CNS) atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor (ATRT) is controversial. We describe 4 children treated with sarcoma-like therapy and review the literature to evaluate outcome in relation to treatment modalities. PROCEDURE: Reports from 1995 to 2007, describing clinical features of children (< or =18 years) were reviewed for details of demography, therapy, and outcome. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were used to study the impact of clinical features, demography, and therapy on overall survival (OS). RESULTS: The median OS for patients treated with multiagent chemotherapy (n=79) was 17.3 months (range, 1.5-93 mo); unrelated to age at diagnosis, sex, tumor site, and extent of resection. Overall mortality was 67%. Disease progression (craniospinal spread in 58%) was the major cause of death. Patients (n=30) treated with intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy had significantly higher 2-year OS [64% (95% confidence interval, 46.5-82.0) vs. 17.3% (95% confidence interval, 5.4-29.3); P<0.0001] and lower prevalence of distant CNS metastasis compared with those without IT therapy (n=49) (20% vs. 59.2%; P=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Despite dismal OS, multimodal therapy can induce remission even in metastatic CNS ATRT with partial resection. IT chemotherapy results in higher OS and, because of an overall high rate of distant relapse, should be considered in future trials.\n",
      "Acromelic frontonasal dysostosis (AFND) represents a subgroup of patients with frontonasal malformation with limb abnormalities including preaxial polydactyly and tibial hypoplasia. Previous case reports have suggested autosomal recessive inheritance, given parental consanguinity. However, no affected siblings have been described. Longitudinal clinical history is limited as many do not survive the first years of life. The molecular basis of AFND is not known. Previous investigators have proposed that AFND may result from a perturbation in the Sonic Hedgehog pathway. We present clinical and radiographic findings in two unrelated boys, ages 8 and 9 years, with AFND, one of whom has a family history suggesting dominant inheritance. A focused study of genetic marker data and candidate gene mutation analysis in this family is presented.\n",
      "X-linked calvarial hyperostosis is a rare disorder characterized by isolated calvarial thickening. Symptoms are prominent frontoparietal bones, a flat nasal root and a short upturned nose, a high forehead with ridging of the metopic and sagittal sutures, and lateral frontal prominences. The mandible is normal, as are the clavicles, pelvis and long bones. The thickened bone in the skull appears to be softer than normal bone. Despite calvarial hyperostosis, increased intracranial pressure and cranial nerve entrapment do not occur. The major disability seems to be cosmetic. The disease segregates with an X-linked recessive mode of inheritance. Female carriers do not show any clinical symptoms. To date, only one family has been described with X-linked calvarial hyperostosis including three affected individuals. In order to localize the disease causing gene, 31 polymorphic microsatellite markers that spread across the X-chromosome were analyzed. Genotypes were combined in haplotypes to delineate the region. A chromosomal region spanning from Xq27.3 to Xqter cosegregates with the disorder. This region encompasses 23.53cM or 8.2Mb according to the deCODE map and contains 165 genes. CNV-analysis did not show small duplications or deletions in this region. Exome sequencing was performed on a male patient in this family. However, this did not reveal any putative mutation. These results indicate that a non-coding regulatory sequence might be involved in the pathogenesis of this disorder.\n",
      "Pierre Robin sequence (PRS) is an aetiologically distinct subgroup of cleft palate. We aimed to define the critical genomic interval from five different 5q22-5q31 deletions associated with PRS or PRS-associated features and assess each gene within the region as a candidate for the PRS component of the phenotype. Clinical array-based comparative genome hybridisation (aCGH) data were used to define a 2.08 Mb minimum region of overlap among four de novo deletions and one mother-son inherited deletion associated with at least one component of PRS. Commonly associated anomalies were talipes equinovarus (TEV), finger contractures and crumpled ear helices. Expression analysis of the orthologous genes within the PRS critical region in embryonic mice showed that the strongest candidate genes were FBN2 and PHAX. Targeted aCGH of the critical region and sequencing of these genes in a cohort of 25 PRS patients revealed no plausible disease-causing mutations. In conclusion, deletion of ‚àº2 Mb on 5q23 region causes a clinically recognisable subtype of PRS. Haploinsufficiency for FBN2 accounts for the digital and auricular features. A possible critical region for TEV is distinct and telomeric to the PRS region. The molecular basis of PRS in these cases remains undetermined but haploinsufficiency for PHAX is a plausible mechanism.\n",
      "We report on 3 sisters with a syndrome of unilobed or absent thymus, renal and ureter agenesis/dysgenesis, and intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR). Two of the 3 infants had a unilobed lung and imperforate anus. Recurrence was detected prenatally by the presence of progressive oligohydramnios and IUGR, a unilateral echogenic cystic mass in the renal fossa, and low amniotic fluid disaccharidases in association with an imperforate anus. Several genetic mechanisms can be invoked to explain this occurrence including autosomal recessive inheritance and an unrecognized chromosome imbalance.\n",
      "The Kapur-Toriello syndrome (KTS) is a rare multiple congenital anomaly syndrome, with presumed autosomal recessive inheritance based on the initial report of affected siblings. Here we report on a female with multiple anomalies, including cleft lip and palate, coloboma, mental retardation with cerebral atrophy, and imperforate anus who, upon re-evaluation at 30 months, was recognized to have a columella that extended below the nares. This distinctive finding prompted the diagnosis of KTS. This is the 5th report of KTS, and the second female. Interestingly, both female cases also manifest an ano/rectal malformation, suggesting that this should be considered a component manifestation of this rare syndrome.\n",
      "This report describes two brothers, both deceased in infancy, with severe depletion of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in muscle tissue. Both had feeding difficulties, failure to thrive, severe muscular hypotonia and lactic acidosis. One of the boys developed a renal proximal tubulopathy. A novel homozygous c.686 G-->T missense mutation in the RRM2B gene, encoding the p53-inducible ribonucleotide reductase subunit (p53R2), was identified. This is the third report on mutations in RRM2B associated with severe mtDNA depletion, which further highlights the importance of de novo synthesis of deoxyribonucleotides (dNTPs) for mtDNA maintenance.\n",
      "Meconium ileus is most often associated with mutations in the CFTR gene; however recently, mutations in GUCY2C in the Bedouin population have also been shown to result in this phenotype. This gene codes for an intestinal transmembrane receptor that generates cyclic GMP, which activates cystic fibrosis transmembrane receptor. We report a third family that supports the association of variants in the GUCY2C gene with meconium ileus (MI). A Lebanese kindred was studied and individuals affected with MI had either homozygous or compound heterozygous variants in GUCY2C. The earliest manifestation of the affected individuals was the presence of second trimester fetal echogenic bowel, thus resulting in the expansion of the differential diagnosis of this ultrasound finding.\n",
      "Two sisters with inherited, severe platelet dysfunction associated with P2Y(12) deficiency displayed a single base pair deletion in their P2Y(12) genes (378delC), resulting in a frame-shift and premature truncation of the protein. GL, the son of one of them, displayed mild platelet dysfunction and normal P2Y(12) sequence. We hypothesized that the abnormal platelet phenotype of GL is due to haploinsufficiency of his P2Y(12) gene. We analyzed genomic DNA from the family by Southern Blotting and real-time (RT) PCR. Southern Blotting results demonstrated that GL has a single P2Y(12) allele, inherited from his father. RT-PCR revealed that GL, his mother and aunt have one single intact P2Y(12) allele, while his father has two P2Y(12) alleles. The single GL P2Y(12) allele contains normal sequence, while his mother and aunt have the 378delC allele. The results of this study support our hypothesis and illustrate the platelet phenotype associated with P2Y(12) haploinsufficiency.\n",
      "Glutathione synthetase deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder resulting in low levels of glutathione and an increased susceptibility to oxidative stress. Patients with glutathione synthetase deficiency typically present in the neonatal period with hemolytic anemia, metabolic acidosis and neurological impairment. Lifelong treatment with antioxidants has been recommended in an attempt to prevent morbidity and mortality associated with the disorder. Here, we present a 19-year-old female who was diagnosed with glutathione synthetase deficiency shortly after birth and who has been closely followed in our metabolic clinic. Despite an initial severe presentation, she has had normal intellectual development and few complications of her disorder with a treatment regimen that includes polycitra (citric acid, potassium citrate and sodium citrate), vitamin C, vitamin E and selenium.\n",
      "Among the tumors of the epidermal appendages, only rare tumors have been proved as differentiating in the direction of the nail. Beside onychomatricoma, we report a new matrical tumor of the nail: onychocytic matricoma (acanthoma of the nail matrix producing onychocytes). The main differential diagnosis of onychocytic matricoma is seborrheic keratosis. However, if attention is paid to the nature of the different layers of the tumor and the peculiar microanatomy of the nail matrix, the differentiation is not difficult. Onychocytic matricoma is a localized (monodactylous) longitudinal melanonychia which is slightly raised. The term pachymelanonychia is used to define the 2 clinical features of the tumor. Pachyonychia indicate a localized thickening of the nail plate, and melanonychia indicate its longitudinal pigmented band. Onychocytic matricoma is composed of a basal compartment with a varying admixture of prekeratogenous cells and keratogenous cells. Endokeratinization originating in the deep portion of the tumor and nests of prekeratogenous and keratogenous cells in concentric arrangement are a characteristic feature. Three major patterns can be identified as follows: acanthotic, papillomatous, keratogenous type with retarded maturation. Given the peculiar thickening of the nail plate observed both in pigmented onychomatricoma and onychocytic matricoma, the term pachymelanonychia longitudinal could be proposed to specify clinically these 2 lesions, which the clinician sometimes mistakes for melanoma.\n",
      "Glycogen storage disease type III (GSD III) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by the deficiency of glycogen-debranching enzyme (AGL). The overall incidence of the disease is about 1:100,000 life births in the USA; however, it is unusually frequent among North African Jews in Israel (prevalence 1:5,400, carrier prevalence 1:35). All North African Jewish GSD III patients examined have both liver and muscle involvement. While all patients showed the characteristic features related to the liver enzyme deficiency, the peripheral muscular impairment varied from minimal to severe, with neuromuscular involvement. A single mutation in the AGL gene, the deletion of T at position 4,455 (4,455delT) in homozygous form, was found in this patient population. The mutation 4,455delT results in the change of 17 amino acids at the carboxy terminus of the AGL protein (1,486-1,502) and truncation of the last 30 amino acids of the normal AGL 1,532 amino acids. The mutation appears to be ethnic specific as it was not seen in 18 patients of different ethnic origins. This is the first report of a mutation in the AGL gene affecting a considerable number of GSD III patients in a defined population.\n",
      "Lymphedema is characterized by chronic swelling of any body part caused by malfunctioning or obstruction in the lymphatic system. Primary lymphedema is often considered genetic in origin. VEGFC, which is a gene encoding the ligand for the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 (VEGFR3/FLT4) and important for lymph vessel development during lymphangiogenesis, has been associated with a specific subtype of primary lymphedema. Through Sanger sequencing of a proband with bilateral congenital pedal edema resembling Milroy disease, we identified a novel mutation (NM_005429.2; c.361+5G>A) in VEGFC. The mutation induced skipping of exon 2 of VEGFC resulting in a frameshift and the introduction of a premature stop codon (p.Ala50ValfsTer18). The mutation leads to a loss of the entire VEGF-homology domain and the C-terminus. Expression of this Vegfc variant in the zebrafish floorplate showed that the splice-site variant significantly reduces the biological activity of the protein. Our findings confirm that the splice-site variant, c.361+5G>A, causes the primary lymphedema phenotype in the proband. We examine the mutations and clinical phenotypes of the previously reported cases to review the current knowledge in this area.\n",
      "Proximal deletions of the long arm of chromosome 13 have been reported only rarely. Here we present three unrelated patients with heterozygous, apparently de novo deletions encompassing 13q12.3. The patients present with moderate demonstrated or apparent intellectual disability, postnatal microcephaly, and eczema/atopic dermatitis as the predominant symptoms. In addition, they had pronounced feeding difficulties in early infancy. They displayed similar facial features such as malar flattening, a prominent nose with underdeveloped alae nasi, a smooth philtrum, and a thin vermillion of the upper lip. The proximal and distal breakpoints were clustered and the deletions spanned from 1.4 to 1.7 Mb, comprising at least 11 RefSeq genes. However, heterozygous deletions partially overlapping those observed in the present patients have been described in healthy parents of patients with Peters-Plus syndrome, an autosomal recessive disorder caused by inactivation of the B3GALTL gene. We therefore propose that the critical region of the 13q12.3 microdeletion syndrome contains only three genes, namely, KATNAL1, HMGB1, and LINC00426, a non-protein coding RNA. The KATNAL1 protein belongs to a family of microtubule severing enzymes that have been implicated in CNS plasticity in experimental models, but little is known about its function in humans. The HMGB1 protein is an evolutionarily conserved chromatin-associated protein involved in many biologically important processes. In summary, we propose that microdeletion 13q12.3 represents a novel clinically recognizable condition and that the microtubule severing gene KATNAL1 and the chromatin-associated gene HMGB1 are candidate genes for intellectual disability inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.\n",
      "To identify the genetic cause of a syndrome causing cerebellar ataxia and eye movement abnormalities.We identified 2 families with cerebellar ataxia, eye movement abnormalities, and global developmental delay. We performed genetic analyses including single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping, linkage analysis, array comparative genomic hybridization, quantitative PCR, and Sanger sequencing. We obtained eye movement recordings of mutant mice deficient for the ortholog of the identified candidate gene, and performed immunohistochemistry using human and mouse brain specimens.All affected individuals had ataxia, eye movement abnormalities, most notably tonic upgaze, and delayed speech and cognitive development. Homozygosity mapping identified the disease locus on chromosome 4q. Within this region, a homozygous deletion of GRID2 exon 4 in the index family and compound heterozygous deletions involving GRID2 exon 2 in the second family were identified. Grid2-deficient mice showed larger spontaneous and random eye movements compared to wild-type mice. In developing mouse and human cerebella, GRID2 localized to the Purkinje cell dendritic spines. Brain MRI in 2 affected children showed progressive cerebellar atrophy, which was more severe than that of Grid2-deficient mice.Biallelic deletions of GRID2 lead to a syndrome of cerebellar ataxia and tonic upgaze in humans. The phenotypic resemblance and similarity in protein expression pattern between humans and mice suggest a conserved role for GRID2 in the synapse organization between parallel fibers and Purkinje cells. However, the progressive and severe cerebellar atrophy seen in the affected individuals could indicate an evolutionarily unique role for GRID2 in the human cerebellum.\n",
      "Integrin Œ±(3) is a transmembrane integrin receptor subunit that mediates signals between the cells and their microenvironment. We identified three patients with homozygous mutations in the integrin Œ±(3) gene that were associated with disrupted basement-membrane structures and compromised barrier functions in kidney, lung, and skin. The patients had a multiorgan disorder that included congenital nephrotic syndrome, interstitial lung disease, and epidermolysis bullosa. The renal and respiratory features predominated, and the lung involvement accounted for the lethal course of the disease. Although skin fragility was mild, it provided clues to the diagnosis.\n",
      "BACKGROUND:The molecular basis of protein-losing enteropathy is unknown. However it has been shown that sulphated glycosaminoglycans may be important in regulating vascular and renal albumin loss. METHODS:We describe three baby boys who presented within the first weeks of life with massive enteric protein loss, secretory diarrhoea, and intolerance of enteral feeds. All required total parenteral nutrition and repeated albumin infusions. No cause could be found in any case despite extensive investigations, including small intestinal biopsy sampling, which were repeatedly normal. FINDINGS:By specific histochemistry, we detected gross abnormality in the distribution of small intestinal glycosaminoglycans in all three infants, with complete absence of enterocyte heparan sulphate. The distribution of vascular and lamina propria glycosaminoglycans was, however, normal. INTERPRETATION:The presentation of these infants suggests that enterocyte heparan sulphate is important in normal small intestinal function.\n",
      "Severe combined deficiency of the 2-oxoacid dehydrogenases, associated with a defect in lipoate synthesis and accompanied by defects in complexes I, II, and III of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, is a rare autosomal recessive syndrome with no obvious causative gene defect. A candidate locus for this syndrome was mapped to chromosomal region 2p14 by microcell-mediated chromosome transfer in two unrelated families. Unexpectedly, analysis of genes in this area identified mutations in two different genes, both of which are involved in [Fe-S] cluster biogenesis. A homozygous missense mutation, c.545G>A, near the splice donor of exon 6 in NFU1 predicting a p.Arg182Gln substitution was found in one of the families. The mutation results in abnormal mRNA splicing of exon 6, and no mature protein could be detected in fibroblast mitochondria. A single base-pair duplication c.123dupA was identified in BOLA3 in the second family, causing a frame shift that produces a premature stop codon (p.Glu42Argfs(√¢ÀÜ‚Äî)13). Transduction of fibroblast lines with retroviral vectors expressing the mitochondrial, but not the cytosolic isoform of NFU1 and with isoform 1, but not isoform 2 of BOLA3 restored both respiratory chain function and oxoacid dehydrogenase complexes. NFU1 was previously proposed to be an alternative scaffold to ISCU for the biogenesis of [Fe-S] centers in mitochondria, and the function of BOLA3 was previously unknown. Our results demonstrate that both play essential roles in the production of [Fe-S] centers for the normal maturation of lipoate-containing 2-oxoacid dehydrogenases, and for the assembly of the respiratory chain complexes.\n",
      "Wiedemann-Steiner syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by short stature, hairy elbows, facial dysmorphism, and developmental delay. It can also be accompanied by musculoskeletal anomalies such as muscular hypotonia and small hands and feet. Mutations in the KMT2A gene have only recently been identified as the cause of Wiedemann-Steiner syndrome; therefore, only 16 patients from 15 families have been described, and new phenotypic features continue to be added. In this report, we describe 2 newly identified patients with Wiedemann-Steiner syndrome who presented with variable severity. One girl exhibited developmental dysplasia of the hip and fibromatosis colli accompanied by other clinical features, including facial dysmorphism, hypertrichosis, patent ductus arteriosus, growth retardation, and borderline intellectual disability. The other patient, a boy, showed severe developmental retardation with automatic self-mutilation, facial dysmorphism, and hypertrichosis at a later age. Exome sequencing analysis of these patients and their parents revealed a de novo nonsense mutation, p.Gln1978*, of KMT2A in the former, and a missense mutation, p.Gly1168Asp, in the latter, which molecularly confirmed the diagnosis of Wiedemann-Steiner syndrome.\n",
      "We present a woman and her daughter with an apparently new short stature syndrome associated with facial and skeletal anomalies and hypernasality. Manifestations included hypertelorism with broad and high nasal bridge, epicanthal folds, narrow and high arched palate, mild mesomelic brachymelia, short broad hands, prominent finger pads, hyperextensibility of hand joints, small feet, nasal voice, and normal intelligence. The mother had short stubby thumbs and the daughter had posteriorly angulated ears and delayed bone age. The morphology of the nose and the hypernasality are reminiscent to those in the velo-cardio-facial syndrome. High resolution banding and fluorescent in situ hybridization studies showed no evidence of 22q11 deletions. Differentiation from Aarskog syndrome and Robinow syndrome is discussed.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome is defined by a coexistence of nevus flammeus and overgrowth of one or more limbs. Remarkably, however, deficient growth of an affected limb may likewise be noted. OBSERVATIONS: We collected from the literature a number of cases of Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome associated with deficient growth such as shortening or hypoplastic muscle mass of the affected extremity. DISCUSSION: The cause of the unusual deficient growth is unknown. Some patients may be compound heterozygotes carrying a 'plus' and a 'minus' allele at the responsible gene locus, and postzygotic recombination would give rise to two different cell clones homozygous for either allele. CONCLUSION: In order to give a name to such paradoxical cases, we propose the term 'inverse Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome'.\n",
      "Splenogonadal fusion (SGF) is a rare congenital malformation in which the spleen is abnormally connected to the gonad. SGF may occur as an isolated condition or may be associated with other malformations, especially with terminal limb defects in what is called splenogonadal fusion limb defect (SGFLD) syndrome. In this article, we report on 5 new cases of SGFLD and we review the 25 cases reported since 1889. Most cases reviewed here have a combination of severe limb and oro-mandibular defects, suggesting that SGFLD may be related to the broader group of Hanhart complex. In addition, several cases have limb malformations and facial anomalies, which suggest that SGFLD overlaps with both femur-fibula-ulna dysostosis and femoral-facial syndrome. The hypothesis of a vascular disruptive event, occurring between the 5th and the 7th weeks of gestation, could explain the limb defects, the mandibular hypoplasia, and the fusion of the spleen to the gonad observed in SGFLD. However, this heterogenous and polytopic condition could also be the consequence of a primary field defect. All the cases to date reported have been sporadic and the recurrence risk is probably low. However, a recent case of Roberts syndrome with SGF was reported that suggests careful examination of chromosomal status.\n",
      "Congenital hypoplasia of the adrenal glands (CHA) is a rare condition, particularly in the absence of a central nervous system (CNS) anomaly. Two major types of CHA have been described in the setting of an apparently normal CNS and pituitary: a cytomegalic type usually with X-linked recessive inheritance and a miniature adult type that, when hereditary, is an autosomal recessive trait. Glycerol kinase deficiency (GKD) is an X-linked recessive trait, and it may be associated with CHA and adrenal insufficiency, presumably because of deletion of adjacent X-linked loci. We report on three sibling infants, one male and two females, with normal CNS and lethal CHA of the miniature adult type, selective absence of pituitary LH; two of the infants also had glycerol kinase (GK) activity that was decreased but not in the GKD range. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of X chromosome markers located at Xp21-p22 was carried out on the maternal grandfather, both parents, two of three affected infants, and a living normal brother. The results excluded the X-linked type of this disorder associated with GKD in this family. Autosomal recessive inheritance is most likely.\n",
      "Œë 2 antiplasmin congenital deficiency is an uncommun fibrinolysis disorder that is diagnostics after a post-operative surgery. We report two brothers cases of Œ± 2 antiplasmin deficiency diagnosed after a prostadenomectomy bleeding at two years intervals.\n",
      "Cerebro-costo-mandibular syndrome (CCMS) is a very rare syndrome characterized by micrognathia and posterior rib gap, with a poor prognosis. To date, only 75 cases have been reported worldwide. The overall survival rate for patients with this disorder has not been reported, and a classification of the patients on the basis of the prognosis is not yet available. The present study analyzed the figures and prognoses of past patients and documented a new case of CCMS. Formerly published case reports and personal communications were used to reveal the prognosis and classification of CCMS. The occurrence ratios of rib gap defects and of missing ribs were examined. Patients were divided into the following three groups according to their life span: lethal type, where the patients died before 1 month; severe type, where the patients lived for 1-12 months; and mild type, where they survived for more than 1 year. A comparison was made of the number of rib gaps, missing ribs, and the rib gap ratio (defined as the number of rib gaps divided by the number of all existing ribs) among these three groups. A significant difference in the number of rib defects between the lethal type and other types was noted. Short life span of severe type patients, compared to mild type, was attributed to their subjection to severe respiratory infection. CCMS can be classified into three categories--lethal, severe, and mild--according to the severity of the symptoms and prognosis.\n",
      "Caroli's disease is the dilatation of the segmental intrahepatic bile ducts which generally presents in a diffuse form, but may occasionally involve only a single lobe, commonly the left one. We report the case of a 64-year-old male who presented with a clinical picture of obstructive jaundice, with Caroli's disease in segments II and III of the liver. Preoperative diagnosis was made using abdominal ultrasound and computed tomography scan, confirmed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. The treatment used was segmentectomy II and III (left lobectomy--Couinaud's classification) of the liver. Macroscopic examination of the resected specimen revealed cystic dilatation of the intrahepatic bile ducts and intrahepatic lithiasis. Histologically there was no evidence of malignancy. Liver resection is the treatment of choice for Caroli's disease confined to a single lobe or segment, eliminating the potential for cholangitis, lithiasis and carcinoma.\n",
      "Cutaneous collagenous vasculopathy (CCV) is an idiopathic microangiopathy involving the superficial blood vessels that was initially reported in a 54-year-old male. We recently have identified this rarely reported entity in three Caucasian males. The first patient was a 59-year-old male with diabetes, hypertension and hypercholesterolemia who presented with multiple, red, blanchable, asymptomatic telangiectasias covering the extensor surface of the forearms, the lower abdomen and parts of the chest. The second patient was a 62-year-old male with psoriasis and extensive arthritis who presented with prominent telangiectasias on the left lateral distal thigh with mild overlying epidermal atrophy. The third patient was an 80-year-old male with atrial fibrillation who presented with blanching, telangiectatic areas on the abdomen, thighs and back. Histologically, the skin lesions showed ectatic superficial small blood vessels with laminated, hyalinized concretions around vessels that were highlighted with periodic acid-Schiff staining following diastase digestion and reactive by immunohistochemical staining with an antibody to collagen type IV. CCV is a rare and poorly understood entity with distinct histopathological features that may clinically resemble generalized essential telangiectasia (GET), yet which may affect a different demographic population than GET. Awareness of this uncommon entity may further help to elucidate its etiology.\n",
      "Hereditary gingival fibromatosis is a rare condition occurring as an isolated anomaly or as part of a genetic syndrome. The isolated or syndromic disorders are usually inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, but an autosomal recessive form has been suggested. We report on male and female siblings who have gingival fibromatosis in association with specific facial dysmorphism. Their phenotype is depicted and described to document this hitherto unreported autosomal recessive gingival fibromatosis syndrome.\n",
      "We describe 2 male maternal first cousins, 7 years and 7 months old, with a previously unreported pattern of malformations including lax skin, joint hyperextensibility, umbilical and inguinal herniae, craniosynostosis, pectus carinatum, several abnormally shaped vertebrae, enamel hypoplasia and hypocalcification of the teeth, facial abnormalities and wide webbed neck, ambiguous genitalia, multiple nodular liver tumors, and mild psychomotor retardation. The occurrence of 2 male children related through their mothers suggests the possibility of X-linked recessive inheritance. It is proposed to call this disorder the SCARF syndrome (skeletal abnormalities, cutis laxa, craniostenosis, ambiguous genitalia, retardation, facial abnormalities).\n",
      "A new association of congenital familial short stature with facial dysmorphism and osteochondrodysplastic lesions is described in two siblings. Clinical abnormalities include severe prenatal and postnatal growth failure and facial dysmorphism. Radiographs show osteochondrodysplastic lesions with a narrow thorax, short ribs, epiphyseal maturation delay and slightly deformed metaphyses. Microscopic analysis of the skeleton shows pathological features.\n",
      "Zimmermann-Laband syndrome (ZLS) is a rare MCA/MR condition mainly characterized by gingival hypertrophy, hypo/aplastic nails and distal phalanges, hypertrichosis and intellectual disability. The molecular basis of ZLS is unknown. Most patients are sporadic, although familial aggregation is also observed with different inheritance patterns. We report on two unrelated children with full-blown characteristics of ZLS. Remarkable variability in expression included severity of neurocognitive involvement and extent of appendicular and facial features. In both, comparative genome hybridization array at a ~ 75 Mb resolution resulted negative, while aminoacid metabolic screening revealed high plasma levels of hypoxanthine and xanthine in one. Literature review identified 50 previously published patients (27 females, 23 males), including 14 familial, clustered in four pedigrees, and 37 sporadic. Tabulation of clinical features confirmed the core phenotype and identified developmental delay as the unique major clinical problem (occurring in 40% of the cases) with a moderately high risk of epilepsy (13%). Segregation analysis in the 20 sporadic patients with available data on healthy sibs and a single pedigree with affected sibs was significantly in contrast with an autosomal recessive mutation. An autosomal dominant mutation with high mutation rate and rare instances of germinal mosaicism seems the most likely inheritance pattern. This work may represent a starting point for future molecular studies aimed at identifying the molecular basis of ZLS.\n",
      "VPS45 mutations cause severe congenital neutropenia (SCN). We report on a girl with SCN and neurological impairment harboring a homozygous p.E238K mutation in VPS45 (vacuolar sorting protein 45). She successfully underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Our findings delineate the phenotype and indicate a possible genotype-phenotype correlation for neurological involvement.\n",
      "A stillborn male with skeletal anomalies resembling achondrogenesis with remarkably sclerotic bones is reported. The term \"Pyknoachondrogenesis\" is suggested for this hitherto undescribed condition.\n",
      "Very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) play important roles in membrane structure and cellular signaling, and their contribution to human health is increasingly recognized. Fatty acid elongases catalyze the first and rate-limiting step in VLCFA synthesis. Heterozygous mutations in ELOVL4, the gene encoding one of the elongases, are known to cause macular degeneration in humans and retinal abnormalities in mice. However, biallelic ELOVL4 mutations have not been observed in humans, and murine models with homozygous mutations die within hours of birth as a result of a defective epidermal water barrier. Here, we report on two human individuals with recessive ELOVL4 mutations revealed by a combination of autozygome analysis and exome sequencing. These individuals exhibit clinical features of ichthyosis, seizures, mental retardation, and spasticity-a constellation that resembles Sj√É¬∂gren-Larsson syndrome (SLS) but presents a more severe neurologic phenotype. Our findings identify recessive mutations in ELOVL4 as the cause of a neuro-ichthyotic disease and emphasize the importance of VLCFA synthesis in brain and cutaneous development.\n",
      "Verloes-David-Pfeiffer mesomelia-synostoses syndrome is an autosomal-dominant form of mesomelic dysplasia comprising typical acral synostoses combined with ptosis, hypertelorism, palatal abnormality, CHD, and ureteral anomalies. Since the original reports in 1995, two other patients have been described with this syndrome, one of them the patient reported in 1998 by Day-Salvatore. In this article, we report on the follow-up of some of the original cases and review the literature. We confirm that the Verloes-David-Pfeiffer syndrome (VDPS) is a progressive skeletal disorder that despite repeated corrective surgical intervention leads to severe limb deformities. No mutations were detected in the FLNB gene. To date, the cause and the pathogenesis of VDPS remain unknown. The latter is characterized in this study as a syndromic type of skeletal dysplasia because besides congenital malformations and multiple acromelic synostoses arising prenatally, VDPS manifests in postnatal life as a severe osteochondrodysplasia.\n",
      "We describe a novel inherited disorder consisting of idiopathic massive splenomegaly, cytopenias, anhidrosis, chronic optic nerve edema, and vision loss. This disorder involves three affected patients in a single non-consanguineous Caucasian family, a mother and two daughters, who are half-sisters. All three patients have had splenectomies; histopathology revealed congestion of the red pulp, but otherwise no abnormalities. Electron microscopic studies of splenic tissue showed no evidence for a storage disorder or other ultrastructural abnormality. Two of the three patients had bone marrow examinations that were non-diagnostic. All three patients developed progressive vision loss such that the two oldest patients are now blind, possibly due to a cone-rod dystrophy. Characteristics of vision loss in this family include early chronic optic nerve edema, and progressive vision loss, particularly central and color vision. Despite numerous medical and ophthalmic evaluations, no diagnosis has been discovered.\n",
      "We describe a family in which two adult sibs presented with a history of congenital nonprogressive myopathy, severe mental retardation and evidence of mild generalized weakness, short stature, musculoskeletal deformities, facial anomalies, sexual infantilism, and radiologic evidence of pituitary hypoplasia. The parents were first cousins. An excess of other, apparently unrelated, genetic conditions were present in other family members. Results of histochemical and electron microscopy studies of muscle biopsies from both affected individuals were compatible with multicore disease. This newly described syndrome likely is an autosomal recessive trait and appears to be the first reported association of multicore disease with mental retardation.\n",
      "The authors report the coexistence of vascular nevi (hemangiomas and arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) of the skin) with AVMs and venous malformations of the brain in male siblings from two related but nonconsanguineous families of three generations. The proband, his siblings, parents, aunts, uncles, and cousins were examined, underwent magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and MR angiography, and when appropriate, cerebral angiography. A father had vascular nevi and a mother, his sister, had an azygos anterior cerebral artery. No other cutaneous or cerebrovascular malformations were present in the parents. Each of the two families had two boys and one girl, 9 to 18 years of age. All the children had vascular nevi and all of the boys had coexisting cerebrovascular malformations: AVMs in three, and a venous malformation in another. One boy had three cerebral AVMs. Two boys had a cerebral hemorrhage, and one also had focal motor seizures. The skin lesions were not those of the Sturge-Weber-Dimitri, Rendu-Osler-Weber, or Wybum-Mason syndromes. The association of cutaneous and cerebrovascular malformations was seen only in males in these families. but females have also been reported in the literature. The results obtained in these families and three other families reported from Western and Central Europe indicate that the association of cerebral and cutaneous vascular hamartomas constitutes a distinct, hereditary clinicopathological entity with autosomal dominant inheritance and variable penetrance. The clinical manifestations of this syndrome are visible, painful vascular nevi, epilepsy, cerebral hemorrhage, and focal neurological deficits. The preponderance of male patients with the full expression of the syndrome suggests a possible hormonal influence on the expression of the gene.\n",
      "Severe numerical dental aberrations are rare, and are most often seen as a part of certain syndromes. We here report on a Saudi Arabian family where first-cousin marriages have caused numerical and structural dental abnormalities linked to autosomal recessively inherited liver diseases. The two latest affected children in this family have had their liver defect successfully treated with fat-soluble vitamins and chenodeoxycholic acid, enabling us to study their dental development. One boy exhibits 11 supernumerary teeth, a general hypomineralisation and enamel hypoplasia, while an affected cousin successfully diagnosed at an early age, so far, only suffers from structural enamel defects. The children are otherwise healthy. There is no resemblance to any known syndromes. We suggest that the supernumerary teeth and the liver disease are caused by the same genetic defect, and represent a new association. The hypomineralisation, however, is most likely to result from vitamin deficiency secondary to malabsorption during the first years of life, before successful treatment was instituted.\n",
      "BACKGROUND:Congenital radioulnar synostosis is a rare malformation of the upper limb, with functional limitations of the limb. CASE REPORT:A 10-year-old child with pain and restricted mobility of the elbow joint was admitted to the hospital. Plain film radiography and CT examination was performed. Radiological examinations showed a congenital radioulnar synostosis. The child underwent surgical treatment - derotational osteotomy. CONCLUSIONS:Diagnostic imaging including computed tomography with three-dimentional (3D) reconstructions, preceding surgery enables planning of the surgical treatment.\n",
      "Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), the commonest inherited bone fragility disorder, affects 1 in 15,000 live births resulting in frequent fractures and reduced mobility, with significant impact on quality of life. Early diagnosis is important, as therapeutic advances can lead to improved clinical outcome and patient benefit.Whole exome sequencing in patients with OI identified, in two patients with a multi-system phenotype, compound heterozygous variants in NBAS (neuroblastoma amplified sequence). Patient 1: NBAS c.5741G>A p.(Arg1914His); c.3010C>T p.(Arg1004*) in a 10-year old boy with significant short stature, bone fragility requiring treatment with bisphosphonates, developmental delay and immunodeficiency. Patient 2: NBAS c.5741G>A p.(Arg1914His); c.2032C>T p.(Gln678*) in a 5-year old boy with similar presenting features, bone fragility, mild developmental delay, abnormal liver function tests and immunodeficiency.Homozygous missense NBAS variants cause SOPH syndrome (short stature; optic atrophy; Pelger-Huet anomaly), the same missense variant was found in our patients on one allele and a nonsense variant in the other allele. Recent literature suggests a multi-system phenotype. In this study, patient fibroblasts have shown reduced collagen expression, compared to control cells and RNAseq studies, in bone cells show that NBAS is expressed in osteoblasts and osteocytes of rodents and primates. These findings provide proof-of-concept that NBAS mutations have mechanistic effects in bone, and that NBAS variants are a novel cause of bone fragility, which is distinguishable from 'Classical' OI.Here we report on variants in NBAS, as a cause of bone fragility in humans, and expand the phenotypic spectrum associated with NBAS. We explore the mechanism underlying NBAS and the striking skeletal phenotype in our patients.\n",
      "The association of diaphyseal aclasis and neurofibromatosis with malignant neoplasms has been variously reported as between 5 and 28% of all cases, but malignant disease invariably presents at hospital and the true frequency from an unselected group is unknown. The current survey reviews not only hospital patients but also their affected relatives, with particular reference to malignant disease and the cause of death in all family members. A survey of 36 index patients and 80 known affected relatives with diaphyseal aclasis and 37 index patients and 33 known affected relatives with neurofibromatosis has been carried out. The observed proportions with associated malignant disease were 0.9% of all cases of diaphyseal aclasis and 4.3% of neurofibromatosis. The authors consider this is still too high an estimate in view of the number of persons in the families only mildly affected by the inherited disease who cannot be identified, although their malignant disease will be known. A more likely figure for malignant change in diaphyseal aclasis is calculated at 0.5% (or 1.3% of those over 21 years) and in neurofibromatosis 2.0% (or 4.2% of those over 21 years).\n",
      "I report on three brothers with a syndrome of adolescent cataracts and infertility. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels were elevated, suggesting testicular failure. Their parents were second cousins, suggesting autosomal recessive inheritance. Hypogonadism and cataracts occur in several syndromes, but with other findings. This association is probably more than fortuitous, and a common pathogenesis may be involved.\n",
      "3-Hydroxyisobutyric aciduria is a rare entity and affected individuals display a range of clinical manifestations including dysmorphic features and neurodevelopmental problems in the majority of patients. Here, we present two novel patients with 3-hydroxyisobutyric aciduria. To our knowledge, these are the 11th and 12th cases of 3-hydroxyisobutyic aciduria reported. It is believed that a deficiency in 3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase is the most likely cause of this disorder. Measurement of 3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase activity in fibroblasts homogenates of the two newly identified patients and a previously reported patient, however, revealed similar activities as in control fibroblasts. Since other enzymes with overlapping substrate specificity could conceal abnormal 3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase activity, we cloned a candidate human cDNA for 3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase (HIBADH). By heterologous expression in Escherichia coli, we showed that the product of the HIBADH gene indeed displays 3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase activity. Mutation analysis of the corresponding gene in the patients suffering from 3-hydroxyisobutyric aciduria revealed no mutations. We conclude that HIBADH is not the causative gene in 3-hydroxyisobutyric aciduria.\n",
      "Congenital aural atresia (CAA) can occur as an isolated congenital malformation or in the context of a number of monogenic and chromosomal syndromes. CAA is frequently seen in individuals with an 18q deletion, which is characterized by intellectual disability, reduced white-matter myelination, foot deformities, and distinctive facial features. Previous work has indicated that a critical region for CAA is located in 18q22.3. We studied four individuals (from two families) with CAA and other features suggestive of an 18q deletion, and we detected overlapping microdeletions in 18q22.3 in both families. The minimal region of deletion overlap (72.9-73.4 Mb) contained only one known gene, TSHZ1, which was recently shown to be important for murine middle-ear development. Sequence analysis of the coding exons in TSHZ1 in a cohort of 11 individuals with isolated, nonsyndromic bilateral CAA revealed two mutations, c.723G>A (p.Trp241X) and c.946_947delinsA (p.Pro316ThrfsX16), and both mutations predicted a loss of function. Together, these results demonstrate that hemizygosity of TSHZ1 leads to congenital aural atresia as a result of haploinsufficiency.\n",
      "We describe the association of auricular abnormalities and cleft lip with or without cleft palate in two siblings. One sibling has postauricular pits, profound myopia, nystagmus and retinal pigment abnormalities. The second sibling was a fetus of 23 weeks gestation with severe cleft lip, cleft palate and external ear abnormalities. As this constellation of features has not been described together before, we believe this is a new syndrome.\n",
      "We report on the natural history of diaphanospondylodysostosis (DSD) in the longest known survivor. DSD is a rare form of autosomal recessive vertebral dysotosis recently identified to be caused by a mutation in the BMPER gene. This condition is characterized by absent or severely delayed ossification of vertebral bodies, short broad thorax, short neck, protuberant abdomen, marked respiratory insufficiency, and normal appendicular skeleton. It is one of a number of spinal dysostoses, which are a heterogeneous group of axial skeletal malformations occurring during blastogenesis with continued evolution after birth. Significant medical intervention and at-home support contributed to the long-term survival of our patient. The patient had tracheomalacia, which resulted in respiratory insufficiency with thoracic insufficiency syndrome (TIS). Tracheostomy and vertical expandable prosthetic titanium rib (VEPTR) insertion operations ameliorated his symptoms. In addition, comprehensive physical and occupational therapy was performed due to chronic hypotonia. A consistent feature of all described DSD cases thus far are renal findings of dysplasia, nephrogenic rests or nephroblastomatosis, and/or cysts. The patient's renal cysts were monitored with serial ultrasounds at approximately 6-month intervals. The patient was diagnosed with bilateral renal cysts by ultrasound as a neonate, with eventual diagnosis at approximately 20 months of age with nephroblastoma suggesting this maybe an intrinsic part of DSD. The lack of other cases with nephroblastoma is likely related to the previously reported short period of survival.\n",
      "Gerodermia osteodysplastica and wrinkly skin syndrome are rare autosomal recessive disorders. Due to the many phenotypic similarities in these two conditions, it has been proposed that they represent the same disorder. Both conditions are well delineated in the genetic literature, but despite skin involvement being a striking feature, they are rarely reported in dermatology journals. In this report, we describe three Arab children from two consanguineous families who exhibit overlapping features of gerodermia osteodysplastica and wrinkly skin syndrome. All the patients had dysmorphic facial features, wrinkled skin more marked on the hands and feet, hyperextensible joints, intrauterine growth retardation, developmental delay, congenital dislocation of hips, and osteoporosis. Our observations also support the contention that gerodermia osteodysplastica and wrinkly skin syndrome have the same clinical spectrum; however, this needs to be confirmed at the molecular level.\n",
      "Of the gene-rich regions of the human genome, Xq28 is the most densely mapped. Mutations of genes in this band are responsible for 10 syndromal forms of mental retardation and 5 nonsyndromal forms. Clinical and molecular studies reported here add an additional syndromic form of X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) to this region. The condition comprises short stature, small hands and feet, seizures, cleft palate, and glaucoma. One affected male died at age 19 years in status epilepticus, but others have survived to old age. Carrier females do not have somatic anomalies or mental impairment. The gene is localized to the terminal 8 Mb of Xq28 with markers distal to DXS8011 showing linkage to the disorder with a lod score of 2.11 at zero recombination.\n",
      "Gnathodiaphyseal dysplasia (GDD) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by florid osseous dysplasia of the jaws, bone fragility, and diaphyseal cortical thickening and bowing of long bones. We present a family with previously undiagnosed GDD. The disorder was identified by the characteristic gnathic and skeletal manifestations in the father. Clinical and radiologic examination of the patient's son also revealed the characteristic features of GDD. Gene sequencing revealed a novel mutation (c. 1067 G>A, p. Cys356 Tyr) in the ANO5 gene, which is causative for GDD. This mutation was predicted to be detrimental by computational analyses and by structural modeling of the protein. The implications for recognition and management of this disease are discussed.\n",
      "We report a male infant with an association of hypothyroidism and unusual facies, including blepharophimosis, which is similar to the dysmorphic features observed in the condition first described by Young and Simpson [(1987) J Med Genet 24:715-7161. On the other hand, the patient also shares many features with those reported as having Ohdo blepharophimosis syndrome [Ohdo et al, (1986) J Med Genet 23:242-244]. Previous case reports are reviewed and difficulties concerning the differential diagnosis of these conditions are discussed.\n",
      "Peripheral neuropathy is an uncommon cause of generalized hypotonia and weakness in infancy. It occurs as a part of the clinical syndrome in some neurodegenerative disorders of infancy, but seldom causes respiratory failure or swallowing difficulties. We report a lethal autosomal recessive axonal polyneuropathy with neonatal onset in a large kindred from Northern Mississippi. One patient was studied in detail at our medical center and the information on 12 other affected infants in this large family were gathered from medical records and by interviewing the family members. Patients were symptomatic for the polyneuropathy before birth and died in the first year of life from respiratory complications. Thirteen babies were affected by this clinical phenotype in four generations of this family with a high frequency of consanguinity. Affected babies were of both sexes and were born to healthy consanguineous parents. The clinical phenotype of polyneuropathy in our index patient and other affected babies in this family was similar, and represents a unique form of hereditary neonatal polyneuropathy.\n",
      "Czech dysplasia (OMIM 609162) is a recently established COL2A1 disorder characterized by normal height, early-onset osteoarthritis, platyspondyly, short metatarsals, and the absence of ophthalmological complications or cleft palate. A specific missense mutation (c.823C > T, R275C) in the exon 13 of the COL2A1 gene, coding for the triple helical domain of the alpha 1 chain of the type II collagen, has been linked to Czech dysplasia, which is quite a unique situation among the COL2A1 disorders. Since all of the 11 families and patients reported to date were of European ancestry, an ancient single origin of the R275C mutation was speculated about. Here we report on a Japanese family consisting of three patients with Czech dysplasia, each member showing valgus knees in addition to remarkably uniform manifestation of the clinical and radiological abnormalities. Mutation analysis documented the COL2A1 c.823C > T mutation in all affected individuals. In conclusion, this report provides novel evidence for the independent occurrence of Czech dysplasia among the populations.\n",
      "Epilepsy and Mental Retardation Limited to Females (EFMR) [OMIM 300088] was first described in 1971 [Juberg and Hellman, 1971] in 15 related females with early onset grand mal seizures and mental retardation. Although EFMR demonstrates X-linked inheritance, it follows an unusual pattern by sparing transmitting males and affecting only heterozygous females. In 2008, mutations within the protocadherin 19 (PCDH19) gene were implicated as causative of EFMR [Dibbens et al. (2008); Nat Genet 40:776-781]. The EFMR phenotype is typically characterized by seizure onset in infancy and mild to severe intellectual impairment. Several individuals with EFMR have also been described as having autistic features. We describe three unrelated female individuals, ranging in age from 3 to 19 years, with de novo novel PCDH19 mutations. All three individuals have seizure onset in infancy and require the use of multiple antiepileptic drugs. They also have varying degrees of intellectual impairment along with the presence of autistic features. Although most individuals with EFMR described to date demonstrate this unusual familial X-linked inheritance, our three unrelated females with de novo mutations highlight the importance of testing PCDH19 in females with early onset epilepsy, intellectual impairment, and autistic features, regardless of family history.\n",
      "LUMBAR syndrome (lower body congenital infantile hemangiomas and other skin defects; urogenital anomalies and ulceration; myelopathy; bony deformities; anorectal malformations and arterial anomalies; and rectal anomalies) is a rare association between infantile hemangiomas of the lower half of the body and regional congenital anomalies. Since 1986, 53 cases have been reported and no etiology has been identified. We report on the 54th case in a male infant and review the literature concerning the manifestations of the LUMBAR syndrome.\n",
      "A report is given on two sisters with arhinia, hypertelorism, Peters' anomaly and deformities of the maxilla. The lacrimal sacs in both patients were extirpated because of recurrent dacryoadenitis due to bilateral aplasia of the nasolacrimal ducts. One eye showing Peters' anomaly with microphthalmus was enucleated in the elder patient 12 years ago. Differential diagnosis includes frontonasal dysplasia and the different types of holoprosencephaly-syndromes. Probably this new malformation syndrome is a recessive inherited.\n",
      "An informative patient with a MCA/MR syndrome consisting of developmental delay, prenatal onset growth delay, microcephaly, distinctive face, iris coloboma, and a congenital heart defect was found, on chromosome analysis, to have the following complement: 46,XY,rec(4) dup(4p) inv(4)(p14q35.1) mat. He has a partial 4p trisomy/distal 4q deletion due to an unbalanced pericentric inversion inherited from his mother. Dup (4p) trisomy was originally described by Wilson et al. [1970: Am J Hum Genet 22:679-690] in a similar case with the same chromosome 4 inversion. To date, at least 85 cases of dup (4p) syndrome have been published, mostly due to unbalanced translocations. Recent articles suggest that the phenotype is hard to recognize clinically due to the lack of specificity of findings. In contrast, 4p trisomy due to an unbalanced pericentric inversion of chromosome 4(p14q35), i.e., the recombinant 4 syndrome observed in our patient, appears to be a discrete entity with relatively consistent features. In total there are four other kindreds described in the literature with this inversion, and the phenotype seems recognizable. Thus, we suggest that recombinant 4 syndrome is a discrete entity among 4p trisomy patients.\n",
      "Phosphatidyl inositol glycan (PIG) enzyme subclasses are involved in distinct steps of glycosyl phosphatidyl inositol anchor protein biosynthesis. Glycolsyl phosphatidyl inositol-anchored proteins have heterogeneous functions; they can function as enzymes, adhesion molecules, complement regulators and co-receptors in signal transduction pathways. Germline mutations in genes encoding different members of the PIG family result in diverse conditions with (severe) developmental delay, (neonatal) seizures, hypotonia, CNS abnormalities, growth abnormalities, and congenital abnormalities as hallmark features. The variability of clinical features resembles the typical diversity of other glycosylation pathway deficiencies such as the congenital disorders of glycosylation. Here, we report the first germline missense mutation in the PIGA gene associated with accelerated linear growth, obesity, central hypotonia, severe refractory epilepsy, cardiac anomalies, mild facial dysmorphic features, mildly elevated alkaline phosphatase levels, and CNS anomalies consisting of progressive cerebral atrophy, insufficient myelinization, and cortical MRI signal abnormalities. X-exome sequencing in the proband identified a c.278C>T (p.Pro93Leu) mutation in the PIGA gene. The mother and maternal grandmother were unaffected carriers and the mother showed 100% skewing of the X-chromosome harboring the mutation. These results together with the clinical similarity of the patient reported here and the previously reported patients with a germline nonsense mutation in PIGA support the determination that this mutation caused the phenotype in this family.\n",
      "Glycogen storage disease confined to the heart due to cardiac phosphorylase kinase deficiency causes a fatal infantile cardiomyopathy. Cardiomegaly can be detected in utero and is progressive. Electrocardiographic and echocardiographic findings are characteristic but not specific; these include large QRS complexes, short PR interval, and a hypertrophic nonobstructive pattern. Conclusive diagnosis requires biochemical analysis of myocardium, which may not be possible premortem due to the amount of tissue required. Pathologic examination of a standard cardiac biopsy can provide a presumptive diagnosis. There is no current treatment except a heart transplant. Infants succumb to heart failure and/or respiratory compromise due to pulmonary compression. This is a rare entity; only three cases have been reported to our knowledge. We report two additional cases.\n",
      "We report on a 9-year-old girl with subtelomeric 20p microdeletion. She was referred for genetic counseling because of learning difficulties/school problems. During the evaluation short stature, hypoplastic fingernails, submucous cleft palate with cleft uvula, flat feet, and frequent upper respiratory infections, as well as the large fontanelle after birth were observed. No facial dysmorphic features specific for chromosomal aberrations were present. The diagnosis of deletion of 20p13 was established by MLPA, and delineated by arrayCGH. Our report describes the third individual with this approximate deletion, and presents detailed molecular and phenotypic characteristics providing new data supporting future genotype-phenotype study.\n",
      "BACKGROUND:Recessively inherited hereditary inclusion body myopathy (HIBM) with quadriceps sparing was initially described only in Jews originating from the region of Persia. The recent identification of the gene responsible for this myopathy and the common \"Persian Jewish mutation\" (M712T) enabled the re-evaluation of atypical phenotypes and the epidemiology of HIBM in various communities in the Middle East. OBJECTIVE:To test for the M712T mutation in the DNA from HIBM patients in the Middle East. METHODS:DNA from all suspected HIBM patients was tested for the M712T mutation. Unaffected members of families with genetically proven HIBM were studied too. In the majority of families, haplotype construction with markers spanning the 700-kb region of the HIBM gene was performed. RESULTS:One hundred twenty-nine HIBM patients of 55 families (Middle Eastern Jews, Karaites, and Arab Muslims of Palestinian and Bedouin origin) were homozygous for the M712T mutation, and all carried the same haplotype. Five clinically unaffected subjects were also homozygous for the common mutation and haplotype, including two older adults (ages 50 and 68 years). Atypical features with this same mutation were marked quadriceps weakness in five patients, proximal weakness only in two patients, facial weakness in three patients, and a muscle biopsy showing perivascular inflammation in one patient. CONCLUSIONS:The phenotypic spectrum of recessive HIBM is wider than previously described, and the diagnostic criteria for this myopathy must be changed. The Middle Eastern cluster is the result of a founder mutation, with incomplete penetrance, that is approximately 1,300 years old and is not limited to Jews.\n",
      "Leukodystrophies are a heterogeneous group of disorders associated with abnormal central nervous system white matter. The clinical features invariably include upper motor neuron signs and developmental regression with or without other neurological manifestations. The objective of this study was to characterize clinically and genetically a new form of childhood-onset leukodystrophy with ataxia and tremor. We recruited seven French-Canadian cases belonging to five families affected by an unknown form of childhood-onset leukodystrophy. Genome-wide scans (GWS) were performed using the Illumina Hap310 or Hap610 Bead Chip to identify regions of shared homozygosity that were further studied for linkage with STS markers. All cases presented between the ages of 1 and 5 years with spasticity along with other upper motor neuron signs, prominent postural tremor, and cerebellar signs. Though motor regression is a constant feature, cognitive functions are relatively preserved, even late in the course of the disease. The higher frequency of founder diseases in the French-Canadian population and the segregation in pedigrees are suggestive of a recessive mode of inheritance. By homozygosity mapping, we established linkage to a 12.6-Mb SNP-haplotyped region on chromosome 10q22.3-10q23.31 (maximum LOD score: 5.47). We describe an autosomal recessive childhood-onset leukodystrophy with ataxia and tremor mapping to a 12.6 Mb interval on chromosome 10q22.3-10q23.31. Identification of the mutated gene will allow precise diagnosis and genetic counseling and shed light on how its perturbed function leads to white matter abnormalities.\n",
      "A Mexican family is presented with the main clinical features of camptodactyly, a distinctive facial appearance because of ocular hypertelorism, telecanthus, symblepharon and spinal defects. Other clinical manifestations included: multiple nevi, simplified ears, retrognathia, congenital shortness of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, thin hands and feet, a small penis and mild mental retardation. Radiographic studies revealed spina bifida occulta at cervical and dorso-lumbar levels, increased bone trabeculae, cortical thickening and delayed bone age. The presence of five affected members through four generations suggests autosomal dominant inheritance although no male-to-male transmission was documented. The authors propose this as a new entity, and have designated it Guadalajara camptodactyly type III.\n",
      "Riboflavin, or vitamin B2, is a precursor to flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and flavin mononucleotide (FMN) molecules, required in biological oxidation-reduction reactions. We previously reported a case of a newborn female who had clinical and biochemical features of multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenation deficiency (MADD), which was corrected by riboflavin supplementation. The mother was then found to be persistently riboflavin deficient, suggesting that a possible genetic defect in riboflavin transport in the mother was the cause of the transient MADD seen in the infant. Two recently-identified riboflavin transporters G protein-coupled receptor 172B (GPR172B or RFT1) and riboflavin transporter 2 (C20orf54 or RFT2) were screened for mutations. Two missense sequence variations, c.209A>G [p.Q70R] and c.886G>A [p.V296M] were found in GPR172B. In vitro functional studies of both missense variations showed that riboflavin transport was unaffected by these variations. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed a de novo deletion in GPR172B spanning exons 2 and 3 in one allele from the mother. We postulate that haploinsufficiency of this riboflavin transporter causes mild riboflavin deficiency, and when coupled with nutritional riboflavin deficiency in pregnancy, resulted in the transient riboflavin-responsive disease seen in her newborn infant. This is the first report of a genetic defect in riboflavin transport in humans.\n",
      "Potocki-Shaffer syndrome (PSS) is a contiguous gene deletion syndrome that results from haploinsufficiency of at least two genes within the short arm of chromosome 11[del(11)(p11.2p12)]. The clinical features of PSS can include developmental delay, mental retardation, multiple exostoses, parietal foramina, enlarged anterior fontanel, minor craniofacial anomalies, ophthalmologic anomalies, and genital abnormalities in males. We constructed a natural panel of 11p11.2-p13 deletions using cell lines from 10 affected individuals, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), microsatellite analyses, and array-based comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH). We then compared the deletion sizes and clinical features between affected individuals. The full spectrum of PSS manifests when deletions are at least 2.1 Mb in size, spanning from D11S1393 to D11S1385/D11S1319 (44.6-46.7 Mb from the 11p terminus) and encompassing EXT2, responsible for multiple exostoses, and ALX4, causing parietal foramina. Yet one subject with parietal foramina whose deletion does not include ALX4 indicates that ALX4 in this subject may be rendered functionally haploinsufficient by a position effect. Based on comparative deletion mapping of eight individuals with the full PSS syndrome including mental retardation and two PSS families with no mental retardation, at least one gene related to mental retardation is likely located between D11S554 and D11S1385/D11S1319, 45.6-46.7 Mb from the 11p terminus.\n",
      "Central cloudy corneal dystrophy of Francois was first described in 1955 by J. Francois; its pathophysiology remains unknown. An 80-year-old woman with bilateral central cloudy corneal dystrophy of Francois was examined after having undergone a combined penetrating keratoplasty and cataract extraction. The corneal button was obtained. Light microscopy revealed stromal staining for acid mucopolysaccharide. Transmission electron microscopy revealed extracellular vacuoles, some of which had fibrillogranular material and electron-dense deposits. Fibrillogranular material was present in and around some keratocytes. Numerous endothelial vacuoles contained light-staining fibrillogranular material and round electron-dense granules. Our findings suggest that the opacities in patients with central cloudy corneal dystrophy of Francois are due to the extracellular accumulation of mucopolysaccharide and lipidlike material. Further studies are needed to elucidate the nature of these deposits.\n",
      "We describe three unrelated patients of European descent carrying an overlapping 3q26.33-3q27.2 microdeletion who share common clinical features: neonatal hypotonia, severe feeding problems, specific facial features, abnormal dentition, recurrent upper airways infections, developmental delay and severe growth impairment. One of the patients carries a smaller deletion and presents a milder phenotype. We propose that 3q26.33-3q27.2 microdeletion may represent a novel condition caused by the haploinsufficiency of dosage sensitive genes, several of which are involved in brain development.\n",
      "Hypomorphic germline mutations in the PIGA (phosphatidylinositol glycan class A) gene recently were recognized as the cause of a clinically heterogeneous spectrum of X-linked disorders including (i) early onset epileptic encephalopathy with severe muscular hypotonia, dysmorphism, multiple congenital anomalies, and early death (\"MCAHS2\"), (ii) neurodegenerative encephalopathy with systemic iron overload (ferro-cerebro-cutaneous syndrome, \"FCCS\"), and (iii) intellectual disability and seizures without dysmorphism. Previous studies showed that the recurrent PIGA germline mutation c.1234C>T (p.Arg412*) leads to a clinical phenotype at the most severe end of the spectrum associated with early infantile lethality. We identified three additional individuals from two unrelated families with the same PIGA mutation. Major clinical findings include early onset intractable epileptic encephalopathy with a burst-suppression pattern on EEG, generalized muscular hypotonia, structural brain abnormalities, macrocephaly and increased birth weight, joint contractures, coarse facial features, widely spaced eyes, a short nose with anteverted nares, gingival overgrowth, a wide mouth, short limbs with short distal phalanges, and a small penis. Based on the phenotypic overlap with Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome type 2 (SGBS2), we hypothesized that both disorders might have the same underlying cause. We were able to confirm the same c.1234C>T (p.Arg412*) mutation in the DNA sample from an affected fetus of the original family affected with SGBS2. We conclude that the recurrent PIGA germline mutation c.1234C>T leads to a recognizable clinical phenotype with a poor prognosis and is the cause of SGBS2.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To describe a previously unreported clinical entity superficially resembling macular serpiginous choroiditis but with a distinct presentation and clinical course. METHODS: A retrospective review of the medical records of five patients, aged 50 to 68 years, exhibiting this entity seen at five different centers from 1999 to 2006. RESULTS: The lesions in the patients in this study are in some respects similar to those of acute macular serpiginous choroiditis. The patients had well-delineated whitish plaque-like lesions involving the macula and sparing the peripapillary areas of both eyes. In contrast to serpiginous choroiditis, visual acuity remained good despite early involvement of the fovea until complications related to choroidal neovascularization (CNV) or pigmentary mottling developed. The angiographic characteristics and the clinical course were also atypical. Fluorescein angiography revealed well-defined early hypofluorescent areas, which partially filled-in in the late phase. Indocyanine green angiography showed the hypofluorescence to be persistent. Unlike serpiginous choroiditis, the white macular lesions faded over a period of months to years, but the characteristic angiographic findings often persisted longer. CNV developed in nine of 10 eyes with subsequent conversion to disciform macular scars in seven of 10 eyes. Unlike serpiginous choroiditis, none of the eyes showed chorioretinal scar formation unless related to CNV. CONCLUSION: Persistent placoid maculopathy has features resembling macular serpiginous choroiditis but differs in its clinical course and effect on visual acuity. It appears to be a new entity. The majority of eyes develop CNV, which results in loss of central vision.\n",
      "Few reports of hereditary transmission patterns in congenital superior oblique palsy have been made in the past. In this study, three families with congenital superior oblique palsies have been identified and examined. Two members of each family had a superior oblique palsy. After full history, eye examination, and sensory testing, the patterns in each family have been analyzed. Deviations varied from binocular fusion and orthophoria to large vertical deviations, especially in adduction. Sensory patterns were compatible with the congenital nature of the palsy. A discussion of possible causes for a congenital superior oblique palsy is offered and the congenital superior oblique palsies are analyzed. A definite genetic transmission pattern could not be found, but possible explanations are considered. Regardless of etiology, therapy for this problem is unchanged from that for all superior oblique palsies. Occurrences of congenital trochlear palsies in multiple family members should be considered when a patient with this problem is diagnosed.\n",
      "Foveal hypoplasia and optic nerve misrouting are developmental defects of the visual pathway and only co-occur in connection with albinism; to date, they have only been associated with defects in the melanin-biosynthesis pathway. Here, we report that these defects can occur independently of albinism in people with recessive mutations in the putative glutamine transporter gene SLC38A8. Nine different mutations were identified in seven Asian and European families. Using morpholino-mediated ablation of Slc38a8 in medaka fish, we confirmed that pigmentation is unaffected by loss of SLC38A8. Furthermore, by undertaking an association study with SNPs at the SLC38A8 locus, we showed that common variants within this gene modestly affect foveal thickness in the general population. This study reveals a melanin-independent component underpinning the development of the visual pathway that requires a functional role for SLC38A8.\n",
      "We report on a microcephalic, growth-retarded newborn girl without major anomalies who has chromosome instability in lymphocytes and fibroblasts. Frequent involvement of bands 7p13, 7q34, 14q11, and 14q32 suggested the diagnosis of ataxia telangiectasia (AT) or a related disorder. Supportive evidence was radioresistant DNA synthesis in fibroblasts and radiation hypersensitivity of short-term lymphocyte cultures. Follow-up for nearly 4 years showed largely normal development, and no signs of telangiectasia, ataxia, or immunodeficiency. Serum AFP levels turned from elevated at age 5 months to normal at age 2 years. We propose that our patient belongs to the expanding category of \"AT-related\" genetic disorders, probably to the Nijmegen breakage syndrome.\n",
      "Bilateral acute depigmentation of the iris (BADI) is a recently described entity characterized by acute onset of pigment dispersion in the anterior chamber, depigmentation of the iris, and heavy pigment deposition in the anterior chamber angle. Involvement is always bilateral, simultaneous, and symmetrical. We report the case of a 61-year-old man who presented with bilateral ocular pain, red eyes, and severe photophobia. Examination revealed a dense Krukenberg spindle, heavy pigment dispersion in the anterior chamber, extensive transillumination iris defects, and a heavy pigment deposition in the trabecular meshwork bilaterally. Intraocular pressure increased to 48 mmHg in both eyes. The patient received topical steroids, maximum hypotensive treatment and oral valacyclovir. Intraocular pressure gradually decreased throughout the second and third months, and medications were gradually tapered. The time to complete resolution of pigment dispersion was 18 weeks. Visual acuity and visual fields remained normal, but the photophobia was permanent.\n",
      "We report two unrelated patients with a multisystem disease involving liver, eye, immune system, connective tissue, and bone, caused by biallelic mutations in the neuroblastoma amplified sequence (NBAS) gene. Both presented as infants with recurrent episodes triggered by fever with vomiting, dehydration, and elevated transaminases. They had frequent infections, hypogammaglobulinemia, reduced natural killer cells, and the Pelger-Hu√´t anomaly of their granulocytes. Their facial features were similar with a pointed chin and proptosis; loose skin and reduced subcutaneous fat gave them a progeroid appearance. Skeletal features included short stature, slender bones, epiphyseal dysplasia with multiple phalangeal pseudo-epiphyses, and small C1-C2 vertebrae causing cervical instability and myelopathy. Retinal dystrophy and optic atrophy were present in one patient. NBAS is a component of the synthaxin-18 complex and is involved in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay control. Putative loss-of-function mutations in NBAS are already known to cause disease in humans. A specific founder mutation has been associated with short stature, optic nerve atrophy and Pelger-Hu√´t anomaly of granulocytes (SOPH) in the Siberian Yakut population. A more recent report associates NBAS mutations with recurrent acute liver failure in infancy in a group of patients of European descent. Our observations indicate that the phenotypic spectrum of NBAS deficiency is wider than previously known and includes skeletal, hepatic, metabolic, and immunologic aspects. Early recognition of the skeletal phenotype is important for preventive management of cervical instability.\n",
      "Primary microcephaly is a developmental brain anomaly that results from defective proliferation of neuroprogenitors in the germinal periventricular zone. More than a dozen genes are known to be mutated in autosomal-recessive primary microcephaly in isolation or in association with a more generalized growth deficiency (microcephalic primordial dwarfism), but the genetic heterogeneity is probably more extensive. In a research protocol involving autozygome mapping and exome sequencing, we recruited a multiplex consanguineous family who is affected by severe microcephalic primordial dwarfism and tested negative on clinical exome sequencing. Two candidate autozygous intervals were identified, and the second round of exome sequencing revealed a single intronic variant therein (c.2885+8A>G [p.Ser963(√¢ÀÜ‚Äî)] in RTTN exon 23). RT-PCR confirmed that this change creates a cryptic splice donor and thus causes retention of the intervening 7 bp of the intron and leads to premature truncation. On the basis of this finding, we reanalyzed the exome file of a second consanguineous family affected by a similar phenotype and identified another homozygous change in RTTN as the likely causal mutation. Combined linkage analysis of the two families confirmed that RTTN maps to the only significant linkage peak. Finally, through international collaboration, a Canadian multiplex family affected by microcephalic primordial dwarfism and biallelic mutation of RTTN was identified. Our results expand the phenotype of RTTN-related disorders, hitherto limited to polymicrogyria, to include microcephalic primordial dwarfism with a complex brain phenotype involving simplified gyration.\n",
      "BACKGROUND:Biotin, a water-soluble vitamin, is used as a co-factor by enzymes involved in carboxylation reactions. It functions as the carboxyl carrier for biotin-dependent carboxylases. These enzymes catalyze gluconeogenesis, fatty acid metabolism and amino acid catabolism, thus biotin plays an essential role in maintaining metabolic homeostasis. Biotinidase deficiency is an inherited metabolic disorder characterized by neurological and cutaneous symptoms, treated by oral administration of the vitamin biotin. In central Anatolia marriages between relatives are very common (26%). INFANTS AND METHODS:We screened 34,378 infants born in four cities in central Anatolia during the one-year period beginning February 2006 for deficiency of the enzyme biotinidase. A simple calorimetric screening procedure was used to detect the presence or absence of biotinidase activity on the same blood-soaked filter paper cards used for screening for phenylketonuria. Positive samples were confirmed with a quantitative method. RESULTS:One newborn infant with partial biotinidase deficiency (10-30% of mean normal serum activity) was identified during the 12-month pilot study. The estimated incidence of partial biotinidase deficiency in central Anatolia is approximately 1:34,378; this ratio was the same in findings from Istanbul (1:33,307). CONCLUSIONS:Like children with profound biotinidase deficiency, children with partial biotinidase deficiency are symptom-free at birth. However, the subsequent occurrence of symptoms of profound biotinidase deficiency in our patient with partial deficiency suggests that biotin therapy for this condition may be warranted. It is known that in Turkey marriages between relatives are common. If the neonatal screening program is widened the real ratio can be determined, where marriages between relatives are very high in central Anatolia.\n",
      "Aromatase, or CYP19A1, is a type II cytochrome CYP450 enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of C19 androgens to C18 estrogens. Its crucial role in both female and male physiology has been deduced from human and animal studies using aromatase inhibitors, genetically altered mice, and patients with aromatase deficiency. The latter is an extremely rare disorder. Its diagnosis is particularly difficult in males, who go through puberty normally and therefore usually present as adults with elevated testosterone, bone abnormalities (e.g., delayed bone age and low bone mass), and metabolic syndrome. In this report, we describe a new case of a male patient with aromatase deficiency harboring a known mutation who presented with less severe clinical and biochemical features.The patient presented with low bone mass and delayed bone age after a finger fracture at age 25years. FSH, LH and testosterone levels were normal, but estradiol and estrone levels were absent or barely detectable, raising suspicion for aromatase deficiency. A homozygous c.628G>A mutation in exon 5 was confirmed by direct sequencing. Unlike previously reported cases of aromatase deficiency, he did not display biochemical features of insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, or overweight/obese status. Therapy with estradiol led to the closure of growth plates and a dramatic increase in bone mass.Here we explore genotype/phenotype associations of this new case compared to cases reported previously. We conclude that the specific nature of mutation c.628G>A, which can potentially result in several different forms of the aromatase enzyme, may lend an explanation to the variable phenotypes associated with this particular genotype.\n",
      "Two patients are described with a symbrachydactyly of the hand and foot. This is a rare combination which cannot be explained by the subclavian artery supply disruption sequence.\n",
      "The signal pathway of the C-type natriuretic (CNP) and its receptor, natriuretic peptide receptor 2 (NPR2) is involved in the longitudinal growth of long bones. Loss of function mutations at NPR2 cause acromesomelic dysplasia, type Maroteaux, while overproduction of CNP by chromosomal translocation and a gain-of-function mutation at NPR2 have been reported to be responsible for an overgrowth syndrome in three cases and one family, respectively. We identified a four-generation family with an overgrowth syndrome characterized by tall stature, macrodactyly of the great toes, scoliosis, coxa valga and slipped capital femoral epiphysis, similar to those previously reported in association with CNP/NPR2 overactivity. The serum level of amino-terminal proCNP was normal in the proband. A novel missense mutation of NPR2, c.1462G>C (p.Ala488Pro) was found to co-segregate with the phenotype in this family. In vitro transfection assay of the mutant NPR2 revealed overactivity of the mutant receptor at baseline as well as with the ligand. This overgrowth syndrome caused by a gain-of-function mutation at NPR2 should be differentiated from Marfan or related syndromes, and may be categorized along with the overgrowth syndrome caused by overproduction of CNP due to its phenotypical similarity as overgrowth CNP/NPR2 signalopathy.\n",
      "A brother and two sisters of remotely consanguineous parents had congenital laryngeal abductor paralysis and moderate mental retardation. In the two older sibs, mental deficiency could have resulted from birth asphyxia, but the youngest girl was already microcephalic at birth and had no apparent asphyxia. The mother, who was healthy and of normal intelligence, was found on laryngoscopy to have unilateral laryngeal abductor paralysis. This is the first family with both mentally retarded and nonretarded affected members with congenital laryngeal abductor paralysis. Inheritance is most likely autosomal dominant with variable expression, but autosomal recessive inheritance, with both parents carriers and the mother an affected homozygote, and X linked inheritance are also possible.\n",
      "Snyder-Robinson syndrome is a rare form of X-linked intellectual disability caused by mutations in the spermine synthase (SMS) gene, and characterized by intellectual disability, thin habitus with diminished muscle mass, osteoporosis, kyphoscoliosis, facial dysmorphism (asymmetry, full lower lip), long great toes, and nasal or dysarthric speech. Physical signs seem to evolve from childhood to adulthood. We describe the first Italian patient with Snyder-Robinson syndrome and a novel nonsense mutation in SMS (c.200G>A; p.G67X). Apart from the typical features of the syndrome, the index patient presented with an ectopic right kidney and epilepsy from the first year of age that was characterized by focal motor seizures and negative myoclonus. The clinical and molecular evaluation of this family and the review of the literature expand the phenotype of Snyder-Robinson syndrome to include myoclonic or myoclonic-like seizures (starting even in the first years of life) and renal abnormalities in affected males.\n",
      "We describe a new Type II congenital disorder of glycosylation (CDG-II) caused by mutations in the conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex gene, COG8. The patient has severe psychomotor retardation, seizures, failure to thrive and intolerance to wheat and dairy products. Analysis of serum transferrin and total serum N-glycans showed normal addition of one sialic acid, but severe deficiency in subsequent sialylation of mostly normal N-glycans. Patient fibroblasts were deficient in sialylation of both N- and O-glycans, and also showed slower brefeldin A (BFA)-induced disruption of the Golgi matrix, reminiscent of COG7-deficient cells. Patient fibroblasts completely lacked COG8 protein and had reduced levels and/or mislocalization of several other COG proteins. The patient had two COG8 mutations which severely truncated the protein and destabilized the COG complex. The first, IVS3 + 1G > A, altered the conserved splicing site of intron 3, and the second deleted two nucleotides (1687-1688 del TT) in exon 5, truncating the last 47 amino acids. Lentiviral-mediated complementation with normal COG8 corrected mislocalization of other COG proteins, normalized sialylation and restored normal BFA-induced Golgi disruption. We propose to call this new disorder CDG-IIh or CDG-II/COG8.\n",
      "A 21-year-old man, with bilateral posterior amorphous corneal dystrophy, was studied by biomicroscopy, corneal topography and in vivo confocal microscopy. The best-corrected visual acuity was 6/21 in the right eye and 6/6.9 in the left eye. Biomicroscopy revealed bilateral, asymmetric, sheet-like opacification at the deep posterior stromal layer. The corneal topography displayed asymmetric against-the-rule astigmatism in the right eye and prominent steepening at the inferior paracentral cornea in both eyes. In vivo confocal microscopy of the corneas demonstrated microfolds and hyper-reflective layer at the posterior stroma just adjacent to the endothelial layer. The epithelium, Bowman's membrane, anterior stroma and the endothelial layer were normal. In vivo confocal microscopy is useful in evaluating the corneal dystrophies.\n",
      "We describe a family with four members, a mother, two sons, and a daughter, who show clinical features consistent with X linked Alport syndrome. The two males presented with additional features including mental retardation, dysmorphic facies with marked midface hypoplasia, and elliptocytosis. The elliptocytosis was not associated with any detectable abnormalities in red cell membrane proteins; red cell membrane stability and rigidity was normal on ektacytometry. Molecular characterisation suggests a submicroscopic X chromosome deletion encompassing the entire COL4A5 gene. We propose that the additional abnormalities found in the affected males of this family are attributable to deletion or disruption of X linked recessive genes adjacent to the COL4A5 gene and that this constellation of findings may represent a new X linked contiguous gene deletion syndrome.\n",
      "Griscelli syndrome (GS) is an autosomal-recessive disorder of the vesicle transport and membrane trafficking system first identified by Griscelli et¬†al in 1978. The three types of GS have specific genetic defects and systemic manifestations apart from classic partial pigmentary dilution, resulting in hypopigmentation of skin and silvery hair. GS-II occurs due to a defect in the Rab27a gene and is characterized by primary immune deficiency along with accelerated phases of a hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) crisis. This rare disorder has been widely studied for dermatological, hematological, and neurological manifestations; however, the oral features and presentations have not been elucidated in detail. This report presents a case of a 4-year-old male with known mutation c.550C¬†>¬†T or p.R184X mutation (ENST00000396307) in Rab27a with oral features.\n",
      "UV-sensitive syndrome (UV(S)S) is a recently-identified autosomal recessive disorder characterized by mild cutaneous symptoms and defective transcription-coupled repair (TC-NER), the subpathway of nucleotide excision repair (NER) that rapidly removes damage that can block progression of the transcription machinery in actively-transcribed regions of DNA. Cockayne syndrome (CS) is another genetic disorder with sun sensitivity and defective TC-NER, caused by mutations in the CSA or CSB genes. The clinical hallmarks of CS include neurological/developmental abnormalities and premature aging. UV(S)S is genetically heterogeneous, in that it appears in individuals with mutations in CSB or in a still-unidentified gene. We report the identification of a UV(S)S patient (UV(S)S1VI) with a novel mutation in the CSA gene (p.trp361cys) that confers hypersensitivity to UV light, but not to inducers of oxidative damage that are notably cytotoxic in cells from CS patients. The defect in UV(S)S1VI cells is corrected by expression of the WT CSA gene. Expression of the p.trp361cys-mutated CSA cDNA increases the resistance of cells from a CS-A patient to oxidative stress, but does not correct their UV hypersensitivity. These findings imply that some mutations in the CSA gene may interfere with the TC-NER-dependent removal of UV-induced damage without affecting its role in the oxidative stress response. The differential sensitivity toward oxidative stress might explain the difference between the range and severity of symptoms in CS and the mild manifestations in UV(s)S patients that are limited to skin photosensitivity without precocious aging or neurodegeneration.\n",
      "Chromosomal translocation of 2q37.1 just distal to the NPPC gene coding for C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) and subsequent overproduction of CNP have been reported to cause a skeletal overgrowth syndrome. Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) is one of marfanoid overgrowth syndromes, of which subtype IV is caused by haploinsufficiency of transforming growth factor beta 2 (TGFB2). We report on a girl with clinical phenotypes of overgrowth syndrome, including long and slim body habitus, macrodactyly of the big toe, scoliosis, ankle valgus deformity, coxa valga, slipped capital femoral epiphysis, and aortic root dilatation. Karyotyping revealed a balanced chromosomal translocation between 1q41 and 2q37.1, and the breakpoints could be mapped by targeted resequencing analysis. On chromosome 2q37.1, the translocation took place 200,365 bp downstream of NPPC, and serum level of the amino terminal of CNP was elevated. The contralateral site of translocation on chromosome 1q41 disrupted TGFB2 gene, presumed to cause its haploinsufficiency. This case supports the concept that NPPC is overexpressed because of the loss of a specific negative regulatory control in the normal chromosomal location, and demonstrates the effectiveness of targeted resequencing in the mapping of breakpoints.\n",
      "We describe a malformation syndrome of bilateral cryptomicrotia, brachytelomesophalangy, hypoplastic toe nails, and excess fingertip arch patterns in a chromosomally and mentally normal mother and son. Familial occurrence of this malformation complex has not been described previously and the manifestations of the patients do not correspond to those of any known malformation syndromes. The disorder in this family may be attributable to the pleiotropic effect of an autosomal or an X-linked dominant gene.\n",
      "Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) is genetically heterogeneous and classification based on motor nerve conduction velocity and inheritance is used to direct genetic testing. With the less common genetic forms of CMT, identifying the causative genetic mutation by Sanger sequencing of individual genes can be time-consuming and costly. Next-generation sequencing technologies show promise for clinical testing in diseases where a similar phenotype is caused by different genes. We report the unusual occurrence of CMT4J, caused by mutations in FIG4, in a apparently dominant pedigree. The affected proband and her mother exhibit different disease severities associated with different combinations of compound heterozygous FIG4 mutations, identified by whole exome sequencing. The proband was also shown to carry a de novo nonsense mutation in the dystrophin gene, which may contribute to her more severe phenotype. This study is a cautionary reminder that in families with two generations affected, explanations other than dominant inheritance are possible, such as recessive inheritance due to three mutations segregating in the family. It also emphasises the advantages of next-generation sequencing approaches that screen multiple CMT genes at once for patients in whom the common genes have been excluded.\n",
      "Large subcutaneous angiolipomata were observed bilaterally around the wrists, knees, and ankles in an adolescent boy. Growth had been slow since first noted at age 1 year. The tumors extended deeply between muscles, tendons and joint capsules, but without infiltration of these structures. The tumors recurred after subtotal excision. Muscular hypotrophy and deformation of bones near the affected joints were noted. An 8-year-old sister had similar tumors, suggesting a genetic etiology.\n",
      "Eosinophilic angiocentric fibrosis is a rare pathology of the sinonasal tract and the upper respiratory system characterised by fibrosis with poorly understood pathogenesis. A 47-year-old male presented with a swelling over the dorsum of the nose. The possibility of fungal granuloma was being suggested on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Histopathology showed thick collagen bundles whorling around vessels giving an onion skin appearance with focal area of vasculitis. An inflammatory reaction rich in eosinophils along with a fibrotic stroma was seen which was highly characteristic of eosinophilic angiocentric fibrosis. Clinically & microscopically it mimics Granuloma faciale, Wegener's Granulomatosis, Churg-Strauss Syndrome, Kimura's disease and few other granulomatous conditions thus making diagnosis difficult. A probable allergic origin is being suggested because of the typical eosinophil-rich inflammatory reaction. Finally the diagnosis of Eosinophilic Angiocentric Fibrosis was given. It is a diagnosis of exclusion having characteristic histomorphological findings thus biopsy is always required to distinguish it from other lesions whose treatment differs.\n",
      "Anomalous origin of a left pulmonary artery from the ascending aorta is a very uncommon congenital cardiac malformation. Different surgical techniques have been employed. The direct implantation has been the strategy of choice. However, postoperative restenosis across the anastomotic site is frequently observed. We present a case in which a flap of the left pulmonary artery was used downward along the main pulmonary artery after excision, in a transverse diamond-shape, of the fusion of the media wall between them. This technique is feasible and effective to achieve a noncircular anastomosis without any prosthetic material.\n",
      "A new case of osteoglophonic dysplasia is described in a Portuguese boy. The clinical and radiographic features are similar to the five previously described cases. The boy died suddenly at 10 months of age.\n",
      "Asparagine synthetase deficiency is a rare inborn error of metabolism caused by a defect in ASNS, a gene encoding asparagine synthetase. It manifests with a severe neurological phenotype manifesting as severe developmental delay, congenital microcephaly, spasticity and refractory seizures. To date, nineteen patients from twelve unrelated families have been identified. Majority of the mutations are missense and nonsense mutations in homozygous or compound heterozygous state. We add another case from India which harbored a novel homozygous missense variation in exon 11 and compare the current case with previously reported cases.\n",
      "Two siblings with a previously undescribed syndrome are presented. They both have severe dwarfism, antenatal in origin, with generalized chondrodysplasia, severe microcephaly with cerebellar vermis hypoplasia, a hypoplastic iris and a papillous coloboma (Coloboma of the optic disc). The first sibling has a 46,XY karyotype despite normal female internal and external genitalia. She has moderate mental retardation. Gestation of the second sibling was interrupted after antenatal diagnosis. The fetus was 46,XX and very similar to the first case.\n",
      "We present a family in which at least four persons have evidence of an inherited disorder comprising a variable spastic paraplegia, bilateral sensorineural deafness, intellectual retardation, and a progressive nephropathy. Focal segmental proliferative lesions with sclerosis suggestive of mesangial IgA nephropathy (Berger's disease) were found on renal renal biopsy in two affected persons. The glomerular basement membrane showed none of the changes characteristic of Alport's syndrome. Males and females are affected and the segregation of the disease is consistent with dominant transmission.\n",
      "We describe two unrelated patients and the mother of one of them showing clinical and radiological features as those previously described in the spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia-brachydactyly and distinctive speech (SED-BDS, also named Fantasy Island syndrome or Tattoo dysplasia) clinically characterized by short stature with acral shortness, distinctive face, mild blepharophimosis, upslanted palpebral fissures, abundant eyebrows and eyelashes, thick and abundant hair and coarse voice; and radiologically by brachymetacarpalia, brachymetatarsalia and brachyphalangia of all fingers and toes, short and broad long bones with normal morphology and small pelvis. The clinical and radiological features present in mother and son suggest a probable autosomal dominant mode of inheritance and variable expressivity.\n",
      "SLC39A8 is a membrane transporter responsible for manganese uptake into the cell. Via whole-exome sequencing, we studied a child that presented with cranial asymmetry, severe infantile spasms with hypsarrhythmia, and dysproportionate dwarfism. Analysis of transferrin glycosylation revealed severe dysglycosylation corresponding to a type II congenital disorder of glycosylation (CDG) and the blood manganese levels were below the detection limit. The variants c.112G>C (p.Gly38Arg) and c.1019T>A (p.Ile340Asn) were identified in SLC39A8. A second individual with the variants c.97G>A (p.Val33Met) and c.1004G>C (p.Ser335Thr) on the paternal allele and c.610G>T (p.Gly204Cys) on the maternal allele was identified among a group of unresolved case subjects with CDG. These data demonstrate that variants in SLC39A8 impair the function of manganese-dependent enzymes, most notably Œ≤-1,4-galactosyltransferase, a Golgi enzyme essential for biosynthesis of the carbohydrate part of glycoproteins. Impaired galactosylation leads to a severe disorder with deformed skull, severe seizures, short limbs, profound psychomotor retardation, and hearing loss. Oral galactose supplementation is a treatment option and results in complete normalization of glycosylation. SLC39A8 deficiency links a trace element deficiency with inherited glycosylation disorders.\n",
      "We describe 14 males from 3 successive generations in a family who have X-linked mental retardation (XLMR), obesity, gynecomastia, speech difficulties, emotional lability, tapering fingers, and small feet. Linkage analysis using markers spread along the X chromosome demonstrated a gene localisation close to the centromere. Maximum lod scores for markers near the centromere, all at theta = 0.00, were 1.36 for DXS72, and 1.46 for DXYS1. The closest flanking markers which showed recombination were DXS84 and DXS94, defining the physical localisation within Xp21.1-q22. DXS255 was fully informative with lod-1 confidence interval for theta of 0.00-0.12. Clinical findings and linkage data in this family distinguish it from the B√É¬∂rjeson-Forssman-Lehmann syndrome and other previously described XLMR syndromes.\n",
      "We present two siblings from a consanguineous Malaysian family with multiple skeletal abnormalities, anterior segment anomalies of the eye and early lethality. These features are consistent with a syndrome first described by Al-Gazali and we provide further delineation of the syndrome.\n",
      "Polyamines serve a number of vital functions in humans, including regulation of cellular proliferation, intracellular signaling, and modulation of ion channels. Ornithine decarboxylase 1 (ODC1) is the rate-limiting enzyme in endogenous polyamine synthesis. In this report, we present four patients with a distinct neurometabolic disorder associated with de novo heterozygous, gain-of-function variants in the ODC1 gene. This disorder presents with global developmental delay, ectodermal abnormalities including alopecia, absolute or relative macrocephaly, and characteristic facial dysmorphisms. Neuroimaging variably demonstrates white matter abnormalities, prominent Virchow-Robin spaces, periventricular cysts, and abnormalities of the corpus callosum. Plasma clinical metabolomics analysis demonstrates elevation of N-acetylputrescine, the acetylated form of putrescine, with otherwise normal polyamine levels. Therapies aimed at reducing putrescine levels, including ODC1 inhibitors, dietary interventions, and antibiotics to reduce polyamine production by gastrointestinal flora could be considered as disease-modifying therapies. As the ODC1 gene has been implicated in neoplasia, cancer surveillance may be important in this disorder.\n",
      "We here report the second and third mutations in alphaB-crystallin causing myofibrillar myopathy. Two patients had adult-onset muscle weakness. Patient 1 had cervical, limb girdle, and respiratory muscle weakness and died of respiratory failure. Patient 2 had proximal and distal leg muscle weakness. Both had myopathic electromyogram with abnormal electrical irritability and muscle biopsy findings of myofibrillar myopathy and mild denervation. Myofibrillar disintegration begins at the Z-disk and results in abnormal local expression of desmin, alphaB-crystallin, dystrophin, neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), and CDC2 kinase. Seven to 8% of nuclei display early apoptotic changes. Both patients carry a truncating mutation in the C-terminal region of alphaB-crystallin (464delCT in Patient 1 and Q151X in Patient 2) which is crucial for the solubilization and chaperone functions of the molecule. cDNA analysis shows the same mutations and no alternatively spliced transcripts. Immunoblots of muscle demonstrate increased expression of wild-type and reduced expression of the mutant protein. Immunoblots under nondenaturing conditions show that the mutant protein forms lower than normal molecular weight multimeric complexes with wild type. We conclude that (1) despite its reduced expression, the mutant protein exerts a dominant negative effect; (2) mutations in alphaB-crystallin are an infrequent cause of myofibrillar myopathy; (3) alphaB-crystallin-related myopathies display phenotypic heterogeneity.\n",
      "Hereditary amyloidosis of the Finnish type (HAF, or familial amyloid polyneuropathy type IV) is an autosomal dominant disease that has been described most commonly in the Finnish population but has also been found in some other countries. Herein we report the first German family whose members suffer from this condition. There are no known Finnish ancestors. We performed clinical and electrophysiological examinations in 22 members of this family. All symptomatic family members suffered from facial palsy, and most of them had peripheral neuropathy. One patient had confirmed corneal lattice dystrophy. Additional symptoms were hypoglossal nerve involvement in 5 patients and oculomotor nerve palsy in 1 patient. The lips of all older patients appeared thickened. The causative G654A mutation in the gelsolin gene was found in all affected family members.\n",
      "We report a three-generation family with nine patients affected by a combination of cardiac abnormalities and left isomerism which, to our knowledge, has not been described before. The cardiac anomalies include non-compaction of the ventricular myocardium, bradycardia, pulmonary valve stenosis, and secundum atrial septal defect. The laterality sequence anomalies include left bronchial isomerism, azygous continuation of the inferior vena cava, polysplenia and intestinal malrotation, all compatible with left isomerism. This new syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. A genome-wide linkage analysis suggested linkage to chromosome 6p24.3-21.2 with a maximum LOD score of 2.7 at marker D6S276. The linkage interval is located between markers D6S470 (telomeric side) and D6S1610 (centromeric side), and overlaps with the linkage interval in another family with heterotaxy reported previously. Taken together, the genomic region could be reduced to 9.4 cM (12 Mb) containing several functional candidate genes for this complex heterotaxy phenotype.\n",
      "Diprosopus is a subtype of symmetric conjoined twins with one head, facial duplication and a single trunk. Diprosopus is a very rare congenital anomaly.This is a systematic review of published cases and the presentation of two new cases born in Argentina. We estimated the prevalence of conjoined twins and diprosopus using data from the National Network of Congenital Anomalies of Argentina (RENAC).The prevalence of conjoined twins in RENAC was 19 per 1,000,000 births (95% confidence interval, 12-29). Diprosopus prevalence was 2 per 1,000,000 births (95% confidence interval, 0.2-6.8). In the systematic review, we identified 31 diprosopus cases. The facial structures more frequently duplicated were nose and eyes. Most frequent associated anomalies were: anencephaly, duplication of cerebral hemispheres, craniorachischisis, oral clefts, spinal abnormalities, congenital heart defects, diaphragmatic hernia, thoracic and/or abdominal visceral laterality anomalies. One of the RENAC cases and three cases from the literature had another discordant nonmalformed twin.The conjoined twins prevalence was similar to other studies. The prevalence of diprosopus was higher. The etiology is still unknown. The presence of visceral laterality anomalies may indicate the link between diprosopus and the alteration or duplication of the primitive node in the perigastrulation period (12-15 days postfertilization). Pregnancies of more than two embryos may be a risk factor for diprosopus. Given the low prevalence of this defect, it would be useful to perform studies involving several surveillance systems and international consortiums.

      "We present a three-generation family with five retarded, abnormally appearing males and two abnormally appearing females (presumably manifesting carriers). The phenotype of the patients is different from that of all other previously described types of X-linked mental retardation (XLMR). The patients had prominent forehead, frontal bossing, hypertelorism, broad nasal tip, and anteverted nares. Chromosomes were normal including fragile X analysis. Skeletal roentgenograms were normal.\n",
      "Classic CO (also called Iso-Kikuchi syndrome) represents a benign, isolated condition associated with normal patient outcome. Nevertheless, clinical follow-up and/or further clinically-based tests are needed to exclude other nail diseases associated with multisystem pathology; complete family history is also important to determine sporadic or hereditary transmission of such condition.\n",
      "BACKGROUND:Limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2G (LGMD2G) is a subtype of autosomal recessive muscular dystrophy caused by mutations in the telethonin gene. There are few LGMD2G patients worldwide reported, and this is the first description associated with early tibialis anterior sparing on muscle image and myopathic-neurogenic motor unit potentials. CASE PRESENTATION:Here we report a 31¬†years old caucasian male patient with progressive gait disturbance, and severe lower limb proximal weakness since the age of 20¬†years, associated with subtle facial muscle weakness. Computed tomography demonstrated soleus, medial gastrocnemius, and diffuse thigh muscles involvement with tibialis anterior sparing. Electromyography disclosed both neurogenic and myopathic motor unit potentials. Muscle biopsy demonstrated large groups of atrophic and hypertrophic fibers, frequent fibers with intracytoplasmic rimmed vacuoles full of autophagic membrane and sarcoplasmic debris, and a total deficiency of telethonin. Molecular investigation identified the common homozygous c.157C‚Äâ>‚ÄâT in the TCAP gene. CONCLUSION:This report expands the phenotypic variability of telethoninopathy/ LGMD2G, including: 1) mixed neurogenic and myopathic motor unit potentials, 2) facial weakness, and 3) tibialis anterior sparing. Appropriate diagnosis in these cases is important for genetic counseling and prognosis.\n",

      "Spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress type 1 (SMARD1) is a clinically and genetically distinct and uncommon variant of SMA that results from irreversible degeneration of √é¬±-motor neurons in the anterior horns of the spinal cord and in ganglion cells on the spinal root ganglia.To describe the clinical, electrophysiological, neuropathological, and genetic findings, at different stages from birth to death, of a Spanish child diagnosed with SMARD1.We report the case of a 3-monthold girl with severe respiratory insufficiency and, later, intense hypotonia. Paraclinical tests included biochemistry, chest X-ray, and electrophysiological studies, among others. Muscle and nerve biopsies were performed at 5 and 10 months and studied under light and electron microscopy. Post-mortem examination and genetic investigations were performed.Pre- and post-mortem histopathological findings demonstrated the disease progression over time. Muscle biopsy at 5 months of age was normal, however a marked neurogenic atrophy was present in post-mortem samples. Peripheral motor and sensory nerves were severely involved likely due to a primary axonal disorder. Automatic sequencing of IGHMBP2 revealed a compound heterozygous mutation.The diagnosis of SMARD1 should be considered in children with early respiratory insufficiency or in cases of atypical SMA. Direct sequencing of the IGHMBP2 gene should be performed.\n",
      "A new Mexican family with the triphalangeal thumb-brachyectrodactyly syndrome is described. The proposita, a 17-year-old female, showed the classic malformation pattern: triphalangeal thumb, brachysyndactyly in the hands and ectrodactyly in the feet. Several members of the family had similar malformations, and others presented minor manifestations of the disease (brachydactyly and nail dysplasia). This is the fourth familial case reported in the literature with the triphalangeal thumb and brachyectrodactyly complex and the third of Mexican origin, reflecting a geographical predominance in the occurrence of this uncommon pathology.\n",
      "Genetic syndromes with proportionate severe short stature are rare. We describe two sisters born to nonconsanguineous parents with severe linear growth retardation, poor weight gain, microcephaly, characteristic facial features, cutaneous syndactyly of the toes, high myopia, and severe intellectual disability. During infancy and early childhood, the girls had transient hepatosplenomegaly and low blood cholesterol levels that normalized later. A thorough evaluation including metabolic studies, radiological, and genetic investigations were all normal. Cholesterol metabolism and transport were studied and no definitive abnormality was found. No clinical deterioration was observed and no metabolic crises were reported. After due consideration of other known hereditary causes of post-natal severe linear growth retardation, microcephaly, and intellectual disability, we propose that this condition represents a newly recognized autosomal recessive multiple congenital anomaly-intellectual disability syndrome.\n",
      "A previously undescribed mutation of hereditary gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (GCS) deficiency was found in a 5 year old boy of Moroccan origin. He presented with chronic haemolytic anaemia, delayed psychomotor development and progressive motor sensitive neuropathy of lower extremities. The parents were third degree relatives. The activity of glycolytic enzymes were found to be normal in the propositus, his parents and a sister, but and a complete lack of GSH was found in the propositus. Accordingly, the measurement of de novo GSH synthetic enzymes was undertaken, and severe GCS deficiency was found in the propositus. Both parents and his sister presented GCS activity ranging from 69% to 90% of normal. GCS gene sequencing showed that the propositus was homozygous for a 1241C>T mutation in exon 11 and both parents and his sister were heterozygous. This mutation predicts a Pro414Leu amino acid substitution. Even though the homology between GCS and crystallographically solved, functionally related proteins is not very high, a three-dimensional model of GCS was derived using Modeller Software. GCS deficiency is a very rare autosomal recessive disorder reported so far in only 8 unrelated probands with severe haemolytic anaemia. In only 3 of these was the anaemia associated with severe neurological dysfunction. We report here the fourth case of GCS deficiency presenting neuropathy, giving further support to the eventual relationship between this enzymopathy and neurological damage.\n",
      "A boy with faciodigital malformations is reported who bears a striking resemblance to Charlie M, a patient described by Gorlin as representing a new syndrome, and to two other previously reported patients. One may interpret this as supporting the validity of the \"Charlie M\" syndrome as a nosologic entity. However, these patients share a number of features with several other face-limb malformation syndromes. We suggest that these syndromes form a \"community,\" in which the overlapping phenotypes of the member syndromes reflect underlying developmental relationships.\n",
      "Campomelic dysplasia (CD) is a rare skeletal dysplasia. The incidence, reported in the literature, is 0.05-0.09 per 10,000 live births. During the period December 1985-December 1990 there were 18,350 live births with 4 cases of CD at Aker University Hospital in Oslo, Norway. This gives an incidence of CD in our observation period of 2.2 per 10,000. Eliminating our first case, because of Pakistani decent, the total incidence is 1.6 per 10,000 among Norwegian infants which is much higher than the incidence previously mentioned. Perhaps CD is under-reported and a high proportion of patients remain undiagnosed. We present four cases and discuss the incidence.\n",
      "We performed exome analysis in two affected siblings with severe intellectual disability (ID), microcephaly and spasticity from an Ashkenazi Jewish consanguineous family. We identified only one rare variant, a missense in SLC1A4 (c. 766G>A [p. E256K]), that is homozygous in both siblings but not in any of their 11 unaffected siblings or their parents (Logarithm of odds, LOD score: 2.6). This variant is predicted damaging. We genotyped 450 controls of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry and identified only 5 individuals who are heterozygous for this variant (minor allele frequency: 0.0056). SLC1A4 (ASCT1) encodes a transporter for neutral aminoacids such as alanine, serine, cysteine and threonine. L-Serine is essential for neuronal survival and differentiation. Indeed, L-serine biosynthesis disorders affect brain development and cause severe ID. In the brain, L-serine is synthesized in astrocytes but not in neurons. It has been proposed that ASCT1 mediates the uptake of L-serine into neurons and the release of glia-borne L-serine to neighboring cells. SLC1A4 disruption may thus impair brain development and function by decreasing the levels of L-serine in neurons. The identification of additional families with mutations in SLC1A4 would be necessary to confirm its involvement in ID.\n",
      "Familial amyloidosis of the Finnish type (FAF) is an autosomal dominant form of systemic amyloidosis showing marked geographic clustering in Finland. The disease is caused by a point mutation, 654G-A, in the gelsolin gene. The Danish-subtype of FAF has been previously described in three families, the patients present clinical findings similar to FAF, and the mutation 654G-T in the gelsolin gene. Three members from two generations of the same family, with familial amyloidosis, were screened for mutations in the GSN gene. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood lymphocytes and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried out under standard conditions, using appropriate primers. Sequence analysis showed the presence of a G to T transition at nucleotide 654 of the gelsolin gene. This is the first report of gelsolin-related familial amyloidosis in a Brazilian family, and the result is particularly significant as this pedigree presents an unusual mutation, described previously in three families, with no known Finnish ancestors (Danish type).\n",
      "Serpentine-like syndrome is a severe and rare association of multiple congenital malformations, characterised by brachioesophagus, secondary intrathoracic stomach, and vertebral anomalies. Other associated anomalies have been described, such as malposition and herniation of abdominal organs. We report the natural history of a baby girl born at 29 weeks of gestation with intra uterine growth restriction, short neck, large rachischisis from cervical to thoracic spine, a very short oesophagus, thoracic stomach associated with a midline diaphragmatic hernia, malrotated gut and median cleft lip. Most of these anomalies were detected antenatally. Molecular karyotype was normal. She died at age 12 days. To our knowledge, the present patient represents the 8th report of a case of \"Serpentine-like syndrome\". Brachioesophagus and congenital vertebral anomalies, in particular rachischisis, are the cardinal features of this condition. All reported cases have been sporadic and the cause is still unknown. We believe that the specificity of the presentation as well as the similarities between available descriptions of patients suggests a common, yet to identify, molecular cause, possibly involving a developmental \"toolkit\"/homeobox gene or related pathways.\n",
      "The acrofacial dysostoses (AFD) are a heterogeneous group of disorders combining varying severities of mandibulofacial dysostosis (MFD) with pre- and/or postaxial limb abnormalities. In 1993, Opitz et al. [Am J Med Genet 47:660-678] described a new AFD with mental retardation in a Sicilian mother and her four sons characterized by intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), postnatal short stature, microcephaly, widow's peak, MFD without cleft palate, mild pre- and postaxial limb hypoplasia with brachydactyly, mild interdigital webbing, and cryptorchidism and hypospadias in males. We report a mother and daughter with this same phenotype, confirming this new type of AFD and expanding the clinical phenotype to include frequent dental caries. Analysis of cephalometric and metacarpophalangeal profiles in this family showed no distinctive diagnostic abnormalities. This family confirms the Catania brachydactylous type of AFD and supports an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance, although male-to-male transmission has not been demonstrated.\n",
      "Acrocallosal syndrome is an extremely rare genetic disorder with autosomal recessive inheritance. It is characterised by moderate to severe mental retardation, hypotonia, agenesis of the corpus callosum and preaxial polydactyly involving both feet and the facial features like broad forehead and hypertelorism. The authors report a case of a young hypertensive male who presented with unprovoked seizures for the first time who had multiple craniofacial, digital dysmorphic features with moderate mental retardation. The diagnosis of acrocallosal syndrome was arrived at after neuroimaging showed agenesis of corpus callosum with interhemispheric cysts.\n",
      "To date, an interstitial deletion of 9p13 has been described only two times in the medical literature. These reports were based on routine chromosomal analysis. We report on two additional patients with an interstitial deletion of 9p13 further defined on array CGH who share clinical features with the other two patients previously described. Our first patient is a 16-year-old girl with a 5.9‚ÄâMb deletion at 9p13.3-9p13.1, initially detected on routine karyotype analysis and further characterized on array CGH. Our second patient is a 7¬Ω-year-old boy with a 4.8‚ÄâMb deletion also at 9p13.3-9p13.1. Patients with 9p13 deletion appear to have mild to moderate developmental delay, social and interactive personality, behavior issues such as attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, short stature, prominent antihelices, hypoplastic nails, and precocious/early puberty. Our 16-year-old patient is the oldest patient described thus far. This report further characterizes this condition and helps to delineate the long-term prognosis in these patients.\n",
      "Two families are presented, each with two affected sibs, all four of whom seem to have a newly described and specific form of congenital contractures (arthrogryposis). The affected subjects have congenital torticollis, dysmorphic, asymmetrical, myopathic facial features, and progressive scoliosis. Two sibs had cleft palate. Malignant hyperthermia has occurred in two of the patients.\n",
      "Epignathus is an extremely rare oropharyngeal teratoma that commonly arises from the palate, leading to a high mortality (80-100%) due to airway obstruction in the neonatal period. We present a case of epignathus immature teratoma with fetiform features, originating from basisphenoid in a 28-week preterm male baby, who succumbed to death immediately after birth. Since epignathus is a life-threatening condition at the time of delivery, a prenatal diagnosis is essential to coordinate the treatment and appropriate management by securing the airway, either by endotracheal intubation or tracheostomy followed by complete resection of the tumor.\n",

      "CHAND syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by curly hair, ankyloblepharon, and nail dysplasia. Only few patients were reported to date. A homozygous RIPK4 mutation was recently identified by homozygosity mapping and whole exome sequencing in three patients from an expanded consanguineous kindred with a clinical diagnosis of CHAND syndrome. RIPK4 was previously known to be implicated in Bartsocas-Papas syndrome, the autosomal recessive form of popliteal pterygium syndrome. We report here two cases of RIPK4 homozygous mutations in a fetus with severe Bartsocas-Papas syndrome and a patient with CHAND syndrome. The patient with CHAND syndrome harbored the same mutation as the one identified in the family previously reported. We thus confirm the implication of RIPK4 gene in CHAND syndrome in addition to Bartsocas-Papas syndrome and discuss genotype/phenotype correlations.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: 3beta-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type II deficiency, a rare form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia, is characterized by varying degrees of salt loss and incomplete masculinization in males and mild virilization or normal external genitalia in females. The clinical signs may be difficult to recognize, increasing the risk of a neonatal adrenal crisis. In addition, elevated 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone and androstenedione levels due to peripheral HSD3B1 activity may lead to a delay of the correct diagnosis and even to misdiagnosis as CYP21 deficiency. METHOD: We report a patient who was detected on neonatal screening for 21-hydroxylase deficiency, in part because of cross-reactivity in the commonly used assay. RESULTS: The diagnostic difficulties in this case were overcome by the use of more specific antibodies. CONCLUSION: This case emphasizes the importance of confirming the etiological diagnosis with molecular genetic analyses.\n",
      "[Bonnet et al. (2010); J Med Genet 47: 377-384] recently suggested a 4q21 microdeletion syndrome with several common features, including severe intellectual disability, lack of speech, hypotonia, significant growth restriction, and distinctive facial features. Overlap of the deleted regions of 13 patients, including a patient we previously reported, delineates a critical region, with PRKG2 and RASGEF1B emerging as candidate genes. Here we provide a detailed clinical report and photographic life history of our previously reported patient. Previous case reports of this new syndrome have not described the prognosis or natural history of these patients.\n",
      "We document a case of persistent lymphocytosis in which the characteristic binucleated circulating lymphocytes were shown immunologically to be polyclonal B-cells. Cytogenetic and molecular studies failed to show a clonal population. A review of the literature on this rare condition, persistent polyclonal B-cell lymphocytosis, highlights an association with the female sex, HLA-DR7 antigen, smoking and raised levels of IgM, all of which were present in our patient.\n",
      "Aarskog(-Scott) syndrome (AAS) is characterized by short stature, and facial, limb, and genital anomalies. AAS can be an X-linked condition caused by mutations in the FGD1 gene, but there is evidence that an autosomal dominant or recessive form also exists. We report on a Chinese family in whom several members have manifestations of AAS, but differ in limb anomalies and show additional characteristics. FGD1 sequencing and linkage analysis excluded FGD1 as the cause in this family. A common known submicroscopic chromosome imbalance is less likely. Both autosomal dominant and recessive patterns of inheritance remain possible.\n",
      "Though case reports and case series about oncogenic osteomalacia due to benign mesenchymal tumours and much more rarely, secondary to malignant ones exist in the literature, there has not been any series reported from a single department spanning the gamut of causes from benign to malignant. We present 3 patients who were seen at the department of endocrinology of our hospital between 2010 and 2012 with hypophosphataemia and severe skeletal complications. All of them were found to have oncogenic osteomalacia otherwise known as tumour induced osteomalacia (TIO) - a paraneoplastic syndrome characterised by renal phosphate wasting and severe hypophosphataemia. The implicating tumours in our patients ranged from a subcutaneous mesenchymal tumour in the heel to a mixed connective tissue variant within the nasal cavity to metastatic prostate cancer. All our patients had protracted periods before the diagnosis was made, during which time the burden of their metabolic and skeletal pathology had increased. A timely recognition of the clinical features and biochemical findings of this rare but potentially debilitating disease is critical. Physicians should be cognizant of the presence of the disease and its localising and treatment strategies.\n",
      "We report a Japanese patient with skin-coloured keratotic papules on the hands and feet, and pronounced hyperkeratosis of the palms and soles. There was no evidence of fragmentation of dermal elastic tissue on histology. Freckle-like pigmentation was also present on the dorsa of the hands and feet, and this appeared to be closely related to the keratotic disorder. The mode of inheritance was autosomal dominant. We consider our case to be a new variant of familial punctate acrokeratoderma, associated with a pigmentary disorder.\n",
      "Idiopathic pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis is a rare idiopathic interstitial pneumonia. It was first described in 2004 and subsequently included in the ATS/ERS classification of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia in 2013. There have been few cases reported so far. The diagnostic criteria is still emerging and its etiology is being questioned. We report a case of pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis probably idiopathic, the first of its kind to be reported from India, and a brief review of the literature.\n",
      "A previously undescribed genetic syndrome with multiple congenital malformations is described. The major components include: 1) horseshoe kidneys; 2) severe mental retardation; 3) characteristic facies; and 4) heart defects. Evidence for considering it to be an autosomal recessive syndrome is also discussed.\n",
      "The first known human case of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) deficiency is presented in this report. The patient is a six-year-old boy with severe growth retardation. He has been suffering from persistent hemolytic anemia characterized by marked erythrocyte fragmentation and intravascular hemolysis, with paradoxical increase of serum haptoglobin and low bilirubin. An abnormal coagulation/fibrinolysis system, associated with elevated thrombomodulin and von Willebrand factor, indicated the presence of severe, persistent endothelial damage. Electron microscopy of renal glomeruli revealed detachment of endothelium, with subendothelial deposition of an unidentified material. Iron deposition was noted in renal and hepatic tissue. Immunohistochemistry of hepatic tissue and immunoblotting of a cadmium-stimulated Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL) revealed complete absence of HO-1 production. An LCL derived from the patient was extremely sensitive to hemin-induced cell injury. Sequence analysis of the patient's HO-1 gene revealed complete loss of exon-2 of the maternal allele and a two-nucleotide deletion within exon3 of the paternal allele. Growth retardation, anemia, iron deposition, and vulnerability to stressful injury are all characteristics observed in recently described HO-1 targeted mice. This study presents not only the first human case of HO-1 deficiency but may also provide clues to the key roles played by this important enzyme in vivo.\n",
      "Amelia is a rare, usually sporadic malformation. We report on a family in which three fetuses had amelia of the upper limbs and variable deficiency of the lower limbs. The fetuses also had minor facial anomalies. Recurrence of the condition in sibs of both sexes suggests autosomal recessive inheritance. Recurrent amelia has been documented in only a few families most often associated with a different set of malformations. Possibly, mutations in more than one gene with different modes of transmission can lead to this severe limb deficiency. We speculate that the mutation found in our cases interferes with formation of the apical ectodermal ridge in the upper limbs and results in its premature degeneration in the lower limbs.\n",
      "Sufficient folate supplementation is essential for a multitude of biological processes and diverse organ systems. At least five distinct inherited disorders of folate transport and metabolism are presently known, all of which cause systemic folate deficiency. We identified an inherited brain-specific folate transport defect that is caused by mutations in the folate receptor 1 (FOLR1) gene coding for folate receptor alpha (FRalpha). Three patients carrying FOLR1 mutations developed progressive movement disturbance, psychomotor decline, and epilepsy and showed severely reduced folate concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated profound hypomyelination, and MR-based in vivo metabolite analysis indicated a combined depletion of white-matter choline and inositol. Retroviral transfection of patient cells with either FRalpha or FRbeta could rescue folate binding. Furthermore, CSF folate concentrations, as well as glial choline and inositol depletion, were restored by folinic acid therapy and preceded clinical improvements. Our studies not only characterize a previously unknown and treatable disorder of early childhood, but also provide new insights into the folate metabolic pathways involved in postnatal myelination and brain development.\n",
      "Anetoderma, is characterized by herniated atrophic macules clinically and by decreased to absent dermal elastic fibers histopathologically. Atrophoderma is characterized by depressed, atrophic, pigmented patches clinically and by thickened and homogenized dermal collagen bundles with absence of elastolysis histopathologically. Atrophoderma elastolyticum discretum describes lesions that are reminiscent of atrophoderma clinically but they are compatible with anetoderma histopathologically. A 34-year-old female patient presented with diffuse, hypopigmented, atrophic, shiny macules on the upper limbs and upper trunk. Histopathological examination revealed an atrophic epidermis with disorganized, hyalinized and coarse collagen bundles in the middle and lower dermis. Elastic fiber loss and fragmentation were detected in the upper dermis. The other patient was a 42-year-old female patient. She applied with diffuse, hypopigmented, shiny, atrophic macules on the upper limbs and upper trunk. Histopathological examination revealed findings that were similar to those of the first case but there was near complete loss of elastic fibers throughout the whole thickness of dermis. Our cases did not show depressed or herniated atrophic macules clinically but the macules were at the same level with the surrounding healthy skin. Histopathological findings in these cases showed the histopathological features of both atrophoderma and anetoderma. These two cases are interesting because they may represent a clinicopathological entity which has not been described before.\n",
      "We describe the clinical presentation, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up data of a 39-year-old woman with asymptomatic right kidney tumor, which was later histopathologically diagnosed as metanephric adenoma (MA). Macroscopically, the tumor had integrity tegument with homogeneous and gray cutting surface. Microscopically, the tumor cells were formed in adenoid or papillary pattern and contained psammoma bodies, without distinctive atypia. Immunohistochemistry results showed they were negative for creatine kinase 7, epithelial membrane antigen, and renal cell carcinoma, and positive for AE1/AE3, vimentin, and Wilms Tumor 1. Pathological diagnosis was MA. The 48 months' follow-up information was available without recurrence.According to this case and literature review, we figured that it is difficult to make a definite diagnosis of MA only by image examination. Nephron-sparing surgery is eligible to treat MA. Long-term active surveillance is necessary because of the uncertainty of the biological behavior and cellular origin of MA.\n",
      "Gillespie syndrome (GS) is a rare variant form of aniridia characterized by non-progressive cerebellar ataxia, intellectual disability, and iris hypoplasia. Unlike the more common dominant and sporadic forms of aniridia, there has been no significant association with PAX6 mutations in individuals with GS and the mode of inheritance of the disease had long been regarded as uncertain. Using a combination of trio-based whole-exome sequencing and Sanger sequencing in five simplex GS-affected families, we found homozygous or compound heterozygous truncating mutations (c.4672C>T [p.Gln1558(‚àó)], c.2182C>T [p.Arg728(‚àó)], c.6366+3A>T [p.Gly2102Valfs5(‚àó)], and c.6664+5G>T [p.Ala2221Valfs23(‚àó)]) and de novo heterozygous mutations (c.7687_7689del [p.Lys2563del] and c.7659T>G [p.Phe2553Leu]) in the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type 1 gene (ITPR1). ITPR1 encodes one of the three members of the IP3-receptors family that form Ca(2+) release channels localized predominantly in membranes of endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) stores. The truncation mutants, which encompass the IP3-binding domain and varying lengths of the modulatory domain, did not form functional channels when produced in a heterologous cell system. Furthermore, ITPR1 p.Lys2563del mutant did not form IP3-induced Ca(2+) channels but exerted a negative effect when co-produced with wild-type ITPR1 channel activity. In total, these results demonstrate biallelic and monoallelic ITPR1 mutations as the underlying genetic defects for Gillespie syndrome, further extending the spectrum of ITPR1-related diseases.\n",
      "Two 46,XY phenotypic female siblings, aged 1 1/2 and 8 1/2 years, have peculiar facies, cardiac, renal, musculoskeletal, and ectodermal anomalies, short stature, streak gonads, and mild developmental delay. Previous reported cases of 46,XY gonadal dysgenesis have not had major associated malformations. These children present a new constellation of anomalies unlike those seen in other types of gonadal dysgenesis and represent a new familial syndrome of 46,XY gonadal dysgenesis.\n",
      "We report a 46-year-old female with late-onset skeletal myopathy affecting proximal limb muscles. Muscle biopsy revealed a polyglucosan myopathy with PAS-positive inclusions predominantly in glycogen-depleted fibers, which were demonstrated as type I fibers by ATPase staining. Whole-body magnetic imaging disclosed that the paravertebral, scapular, and pelvic girdle muscles, the anterior compartment of the arms, and the posterior compartment of the thighs were preferentially involved. Genetic analysis revealed a homozygous novel mutation in exon 6 of the glycogenin-1 gene (GYG1) (c.634C>T, p.His212Tyr). Protein analysis revealed normal levels of glycogenin-1 even before alpha-amylase digestion indicating preserved protein expression but impaired glucosylation. In vitro functional assay demonstrated that this variant impaired the autoglucosylating ability resulting in a non-functional protein. We report a glycogenin-1 related myopathy with a distinct histopathology and unique muscle imaging pattern.\n",
      "Two English families with the X-linked form (Type V) of the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) who were investigated almost 20 years ago have been re-studied. In one family, the potentially heterozygous sister of 3 affected brothers had born two sons, of whom one has EDS. The 3 brothers had all procreated, producing a total of 2 sons and 3 daughters, all of whom are clinically normal. These pedigree data provide further evidence to support the syndromic identity and X-linked mode of inheritance of this form of the EDS. In the second family, two affected brothers had both procreated; one had produced three normal offspring, while the other had a son with soft extensible skin and a daughter with articular hypermobility. The syndromic status of this kindred is uncertain. Serum copper and ceruloplasmin concentrations in affected males and obligate carrier females in both families were normal. Cytogenetic investigations, including high resolution banding, yielded normal results.\n",
      "We report on a 3-year-old male, born at 34 weeks of gestation, with marked pre- and postnatal overgrowth, birth weight of 6,600 g, length of 61 cm, and head circumference of 38.5 cm. A striking phenotype was recorded at birth, which became more evident during the follow-up period. He had macrobrachycephaly, facial abnormalities, small thoracic cage, long trunk, deformed spine, rhizomelia, large hands and feets, absent subcutaneous fat, small umbilical hernia, inguinal hernias, and large joints with mild contractures. Hypoglycemic episodes and obstructive apnea complicated the neonatal period. During follow-up, overgrowth continued with a height of 146 cm (+11.65 SDS) and a weight of 39 kg (BMI 18.3 kg/m(2)) at 3.5 years. Endocrinological work-up disclosed extremely low levels of growth hormone, insulin-like growth factors, and insulin. What makes our patient unique is the association of marked prenatal overgrowth; unusual phenotype; skeletal dysplasia caused by accelerated endochondral ossification resulting in cartilage hyperplasia of the skull base and spine, and postnatal gigantism; and complete absence of subcutaneous fat. Other well-known overgrowth syndromes were excluded. We hypothesize that autocrine/paracrine growth factors could be the cause of excessive endochondral ossification. Alternately, activating mutations in transcription factors involved in both growth and endocrine/metabolic homeostasis could be responsible for this unusual phenotype.\n",
      "We report on 2 sibs with bilateral porencephaly, absence of the septum pellucidum, and pancerebellar hypoplasia including absence of the vermis. Situs inversus and tetralogy of Fallot was present in one, and an atrial septal defect in the other. This constellation of findings is discussed against the background of familial porencephalies and schizencephalies, familial cerebellar hypoplasias, and asplenia/polysplenia syndromes. It is concluded that the described constellation of findings constitutes a new entity of probably autosomal recessive inheritance.\n",
      "We report on a sister and brother born to healthy, double first cousin Iranian parents with a seemingly unique combination of signs and symptoms consisting of intellectual disability, congenital absent voice (aphonia), hearing loss, optic atrophy, retinal dystrophy, mildly broad thumbs, and duplicated halluces. Their facial morphology was unusual: thick eyebrows, ptosis, full eyelashes, long palpebral fissures, downslanting palpebral fissures, small mouth, and low-set, posteriorly rotated ears. This phenotype does not meet the diagnostic criteria of any known entity. Because of parental consanguinity, absence of manifestations in parents, and occurrence in sibs of opposite sex, an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance is likely.\n",
      "Spontaneous periodic episodes of hypothermia still defy medical knowledge. In 1969, Shapiro et¬†al. described the first two cases of spontaneous periodic hypothermia associated with agenesis of the corpus callosum. Recently, Dundar et¬†al. reported a case of spontaneous periodic hypothermia and hyperhidrosis without corpus callosum agenesis, suggesting that the periodic episodes of hypothermia might be of epileptiform origin. Here we describe two paediatric patients with spontaneous periodic hypothermia without corpus callosum agenesis and demonstrate, to our knowledge for the first time, altered levels of neurotransmitter metabolites within the cerebrospinal fluid.\n",
      "We present 2 sibs with a local junctional type of epidermolysis bullosa associated with enamel defect of the teeth, dystrophic nails of the feet, and mental retardation. Subluxation of the lenses was evident in 1 of them. This combination found in a brother and a sister seems to represent a distinct autosomal recessive type of epidermolysis bullosa.\n",
      "BACKGROUND:Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorder characterized by a progressive weakening and spasticity of the lower limbs. HSP is classified according to the presence or absence of accompanying neurologic problems and by the mode of inheritance. Currently, 17 loci have been linked to the various forms of HSP. OBJECTIVE:To determine the chromosomal location of a gene causing pure autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia. METHODS:Genotyping using fluorescently labeled microsatellite markers was performed on three affected individuals and three unaffected individuals from a family displaying pure autosomal recessive HSP (ARHSP) and sensorineural deafness. All family members were then included in the analysis to narrow the genetic interval. Candidate genes were screened for the presence of mutations by heteroduplex analysis. RESULTS:The paraplegic trait linked to a 1.8-Mb region of chromosome 13q14 flanked by the FLJ11712 gene and the microsatellite marker D13S270. The deafness did not link to this region and did not cosegregate with the paraplegic trait. CONCLUSION:The HSP that this family had represents a novel genetic form of pure ARHSP as no other form of HSP (autosomal dominant or recessive) has been linked to chromosome 13.\n",
      "We report on two brothers (born to nonconsanguineous parents) with short stature, hypospadias, scoliosis, vertebral segmentation defects of \"spondylocostal dysostosis\" type, and intellectual disability. Results of cytogenetic and molecular genetic tests performed, including routine karyotype, MLPA (multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification) for common microdeletions and subtelomeric copy number variants, microarray-CGH analysis, and sequencing of four Notch signaling pathway genes (DLL3, MESP2, LFNG, and HES7), were all normal. We present a comparison of the condition in the two boys with known syndromes and suggest that they may represent a hitherto unreported syndrome, most likely following autosomal recessive inheritance, though X-linked inheritance is not excluded.\n",
      "We present two female children with a distinctive pattern of malformation, including persistent thrombocytopenia, Robin sequence, agenesis of the corpus callosum, distinctive facies and developmental delay. We feel that these findings constitute a heretofore undescribed syndrome. Patient 1 presented during the newborn period with thrombocytopenia, Robin cleft, distinctive facies and agencies of the corpus callosum. Her thrombocytopenia has been persistent. Bone marrow aspirate showed adequate megakaryocytes. On follow-up she has mental retardation, microcephaly, growth delay and enamel hypoplasia. Patient 2 was also noted during the newborn period to have the Robin sequence, agenesis of the corpus callosum, a similar face to case 1 and persistent thrombocytopenia. Bone marrow aspirate showed decreased megakaryocytes. She also had delayed development, short stature, microcephaly and enamel hypoplasia. The combination of the Robin cleft, congenital onset of persistent thrombocytopenia and enamel hypoplasia appears particularly unique in combination. The aetiopathogenesis of this condition is unknown.\n",
      "Brothers were affected with severe congenital contractures, multiple cutaneous manifestations of ectodermal dysplasia, cleft lip/palate, and psychomotor and growth impairment. High resolution prometaphase chromosomes were normal. Molecular studies of DNA markers, closely flanking the X-linked hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia locus, did not show evidence of a submicroscopic deletion from the Xq12-q13 region. The parents and a normal sister exhibited none of these findings. This constellation of anomalies appears to represent a unique AR or XLR syndrome.\n",
      "An intensive search over a two-year period for cases of cerebellar and spinocerebellar degenerations in Benghazi, Libya, made through polyclinics, university hospitals and a centre for the handicapped, revealed a total of 52 patients, among whom 30 were index cases; the remainder were detected on family study. Twenty-five patients lived in Benghazi, giving a crude prevalence of 4.8/100 000 population. There were 24 patients (10 families) with hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), 13 (9 families) with early onset cerebellar ataxia with retained tendon reflexes (EOCA), 3 with Friedreich's ataxia (FA), 5 (1 family) with late onset cerebellar ataxia (LOCA) with pigmentary retinal degeneration and autosomal dominant inheritance, 6 single cases of LOCA and 1 with ataxia telangiectasia. There were 14 families with definite autosomal recessive inheritance and only 2 with dominant transmission. The large family size (average of 6.2 children per married woman in the patient group) and the high rate of consanguineous marriages contribute to the high incidence of familial cases, especially those with autosomal recessive inheritance. Nerve conduction studies were normal in HSP and abnormal in EOCA and FA. Computed tomographic scans revealed atrophy of the brainstem and cerebellum in 3 cases of EOCA and 2 with LOCA. No indigenous forms of the disease were observed and the clinical features differed little from the descriptions in literature. However, the relative rarity of patients with FA, in comparison with other types of hereditary ataxias, is striking.\n",
      "Sex chromosome abnormalities occur in at least 1 in 400 births and include the well-described 47,XXX, 47,XXY, 47,XYY, and 45,X karyotypes. The addition of more than one extra X or Y chromosome occurs rarely, and little information is available in the medical literature. Individual case reports make up most of this body of knowledge, and all are based on subjects who identified themselves postnatally. Many were ascertained through screenings of institutions and hospitals; thus, there is no unbiased information on the natural history of poly X and Y karyotypes. A direct relationship between the number of additional sex chromosomes and the severity of the phenotype is generally assumed. The purpose of this article is to summarize what is known about these conditions and to present 10 additional cases. The karyotypes include, 48,XXXX, 49,XXXXX, 48,XXYY, 48,XXXY, 49,XXXXY, 49,XXXYY, 48,XYYY, 49,XYYYY, and 49,XXYYY.\n",
      "A new case of macrocephaly-cutis marmorata telangiectatica congenita (M-CMTC) syndrome is described. The patient presented typical congenital findings in utero, although the syndrome was diagnosed postnatally. The M-CMTC syndrome should be considered when there is a marked fetal overgrowth and progressive macrocephaly with no indications of maternal hyperglycemia or fetal hyperinsulinism. Our patient also had unilateral pleural effusion, curved femur and frontal bossing.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: First and second branchial arch involvement during early embryonic development results in a wide spectrum of anomalies that encompass diverse, superimposed, and heterogeneous phenotypes within the so-called oculoauriculovertebral spectrum. Nine members of a Brazilian family presenting typical branchial arch involvement in association with external opthalmoplegia are reported. CONCLUSION: Macrostomia or abnormal mouth contour, preauricular tags, and uni- or bilateral ptosis were present in association in several patients. To our knowledge, this is the first report on this type of autosomal dominant condition. Clinical and genetic aspects are discussed.\n",
      "Autosomal dominant mental retardation 21 (MRD21) is a very rare condition, characterized by short stature, microcephaly, mild facial dysmorphisms and intellectual disability that ranged from mild to severe. MRD21 is caused by mutations in CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) and this was established through only four unrelated cases, two of which had frameshift mutations. CTCF is a master transcriptional regulator that controls chromatin structure and may serve as insulator and transcriptional activator and repressor.This study presents, clinically and molecularly, an Emirati patient with de novo frameshift mutation in CTCF. This novel mutation was uncovered using whole exome sequencing and was confirmed by Sanger sequencing in the trio. In silico analysis, using SIFT Indel, indicates that this frameshift; p.Lys206Profs*13 is functionally damaging with the likely involvement of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay.Upon comparing the clinical picture of the herewith-reported individual with previously reported cases of MRD21, there seems to be many common symptoms, and few new ones that were not observed before. This helps to further define this rare condition and its molecular underpinnings.\n",
      "Elevated methylmalonic acid in five asymptomatic newborns whose fibroblasts showed decreased uptake of transcobalamin-bound cobalamin (holo-TC), suggested a defect in the cellular uptake of cobalamin. Analysis of TCblR/CD320, the gene for the receptor for cellular uptake of holo-TC, identified a homozygous single codon deletion, c.262_264GAG (p.E88del), resulting in the loss of a glutamic acid residue in the low-density lipoprotein receptor type A-like domain. Inserting the codon by site-directed mutagenesis fully restored TCblR function.\n",
      "Synaptotagmin 1 (SYT1) is a critical mediator of fast, synchronous, calcium-dependent neurotransmitter release and also modulates synaptic vesicle endocytosis. This paper describes 11 patients with de novo heterozygous missense mutations in SYT1. All mutations alter highly conserved residues, and cluster in two regions of the SYT1 C2B domain at positions Met303 (M303K), Asp304 (D304G), Asp366 (D366E), Ile368 (I368T) and Asn371 (N371K). Phenotypic features include infantile hypotonia, congenital ophthalmic abnormalities, childhood-onset hyperkinetic movement disorders, motor stereotypies, and developmental delay varying in severity from moderate to profound. Behavioural characteristics include sleep disturbance and episodic agitation. Absence of epileptic seizures and normal orbitofrontal head circumference are important negative features. Structural MRI is unremarkable but EEG disturbance is universal, characterized by intermittent low frequency high amplitude oscillations. The functional impact of these five de novo SYT1 mutations has been assessed by expressing rat SYT1 protein containing the equivalent human variants in wild-type mouse primary hippocampal cultures. All mutant forms of SYT1 were expressed at levels approximately equal to endogenous wild-type protein, and correctly localized to nerve terminals at rest, except for SYT1M303K, which was expressed at a lower level and failed to localize at nerve terminals. Following stimulation, SYT1I368T and SYT1N371K relocalized to nerve terminals at least as efficiently as wild-type SYT1. However, SYT1D304G and SYT1D366E failed to relocalize to nerve terminals following stimulation, indicative of impairments in endocytic retrieval and trafficking of SYT1. In addition, the presence of SYT1 variants at nerve terminals induced a slowing of exocytic rate following sustained action potential stimulation. The extent of disturbance to synaptic vesicle kinetics is mirrored by the severity of the affected individuals' phenotypes, suggesting that the efficiency of SYT1-mediated neurotransmitter release is critical to cognitive development. In summary, de novo dominant SYT1 missense mutations are associated with a recognizable neurodevelopmental syndrome, and further cases can now be diagnosed based on clinical features, electrophysiological signature and mutation characteristics. Variation in phenotype severity may reflect mutation-specific impact on the diverse physiological functions of SYT1.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: To identify the underlying genetic cause in a consanguineous Chinese family segregating distal hereditary motor neuropathy (dHMN) in an autosomal recessive pattern. METHODS: We used whole-exome sequencing and homozygosity mapping to detect the genetic variant in 2 affected individuals of the consanguineous Chinese family with dHMN. RNA analysis of peripheral blood leukocytes and immunofluorescence and immunoblotting of stable cell lines were performed to support the pathogenicity of the identified mutation. RESULTS: We identified 3 shared novel homozygous variants in 3 shared homozygous regions of the affected individuals. Sequencing of these 3 variants in family members revealed the c.151+1G>T mutation in SIGMAR1 gene, which located in homozygous region spanning approximately 5.3 Mb at chromosome 9p13.1-p13.3, segregated with the dHMN phenotype. The mutation causes an alternative splicing event and generates a transcript variant with an in-frame deletion of 60 base pairs in exon 1 (c.92_151del), and results in an internally shortened protein œÉ1R(31_50del). The proteasomal inhibitor treatment increased the intracellular amount of œÉ1R(31_50del) and led to the formation of nuclear aggregates. Stable expressing œÉ1R(31_50del) induced endoplasmic reticulum stress and enhanced apoptosis. CONCLUSION: The homozygous c.151+1G>T mutation in SIGMAR1 caused a novel form of autosomal recessive dHMN in a Chinese consanguineous family. Endoplasmic reticulum stress may have a role in the pathogenesis of dHMN.\n",
      "Lipoic acid is an essential prosthetic group of four mitochondrial enzymes involved in the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate, √é¬±-ketoglutarate, and branched chain amino acids and in the glycine cleavage. Lipoic acid is synthesized stepwise within mitochondria through a process that includes lipoic acid synthetase. We identified the homozygous mutation c.746G>A (p.Arg249His) in LIAS in an individual with neonatal-onset epilepsy, muscular hypotonia, lactic acidosis, and elevated glycine concentration in plasma and urine. Investigation of the mitochondrial energy metabolism showed reduced oxidation of pyruvate and decreased pyruvate dehydrogenase complex activity. A pronounced reduction of the prosthetic group lipoamide was found in lipoylated proteins.\n",
      "A previously undescribed genodermatosis consisting of tiny hyperpigmented spots aggregated in irregular maculae and mainly localized in the regions exposed to light is reported. Hyperkeratotic papules in the palms and soles were also present. Autosomal dominant inheritance is concluded.\n",
      "AnkyrinG, encoded by the ANK3 gene, is involved in neuronal development and signaling. It has previously been implicated in bipolar disorder and schizophrenia by association studies. Most recently, de novo missense mutations in this gene were identified in autistic patients. However, the causative nature of these mutations remained controversial. Here, we report inactivating mutations in the Ankyrin 3 (ANK3) gene in patients with severe cognitive deficits. In a patient with a borderline intelligence, severe attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism and sleeping problems, all isoforms of the ANK3 gene, were disrupted by a balanced translocation. Furthermore, in a consanguineous family with moderate intellectual disability (ID), an ADHD-like phenotype and behavioral problems, we identified a homozygous truncating frameshift mutation in the longest isoform of the same gene, which represents the first reported familial mutation in the ANK3 gene. The causality of ANK3 mutations in the two families and the role of the gene in cognitive function were supported by memory defects in a Drosophila knockdown model. Thus we demonstrated that ANK3 plays a role in intellectual functioning. In addition, our findings support the suggested association of ANK3 with various neuropsychiatric disorders and illustrate the genetic and molecular relation between a wide range of neurodevelopmental disorders.\n",
      "We describe the clinical and radiological features of a family with a homozygous mutation in TBC1D24. The phenotype comprised onset of focal seizures at 2 months with prominent eye-blinking, facial and limb jerking with an oral sensory aura. These were controllable with medication but persisted into adult life. Associated features were mild to moderate intellectual disability and cerebellar features. MRI showed subtle cortical thickening with cerebellar atrophy and high signal confined to the ansiform lobule. The disorder is allelic with familial infantile myoclonic epilepsy, where intellect and neurologic examination are normal, highlighting the phenotypic variation with mutations of TBC1D24.\n",
      "We report on a patient with a 1.2‚ÄâMb 19p13.12-p13.13 deletion. Compared to previously reported individuals with partially overlapping deletions, the propositus presented with a less severe phenotype, consisting of mild intellectual disability and behavior anomalies, with episodes of simple febrile seizures and without significant physical anomalies or major malformations. The deleted region includes 29 coding genes, some of which have already been demonstrated to be involved in cognitive processes. Mutations in two of them, CC2D1A and TECR, were recently reported to be responsible for non-syndromal, autosomal recessive intellectual disability. The residual alleles of all of these genes were submitted to sequence analysis. No sequence variants were found that could be considered pathogenic. This patient constitutes a further example of the wide phenotypic variability associated with chromosomal rearrangements, likely due to the different size of deleted/duplicated segments.\n",
      "We describe a patient whose features represent a new entity within the oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum. The boy had right microtia, atresia of the external auditory canal, growth retardation, a complex heart defect, and extra-lobar pulmonary sequestration. The cardiac anomalies were persistent left superior vena cava, aortic stenosis, bicuspid aortic valves and subaortic membrane. Spinal films revealed complete fusion of the C2-C3 and C5-C6 vertebrae, and scoliosis of the lumbar spine. The patient's mental development was normal, and there were no abnormalities on ophthalmological examination. This report, reviews features of similar published cases, and argues why this may represent a 'new' entity within the oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum. The cardinal features are microtia, atresia of the external auditory canal, complex cardiac defects, growth retardation, normal mental and motor development in most cases and vertebral anomalies. All six of the patients reviewed were male raising the possibility of X-linked inheritance.\n",
      "Vulvovaginal-gingival syndrome is a distinct variant of classic lichen planus frequently associated with mucocutaneous scarring and vaginal stricture formation, therefore early diagnosis and treatment through a multidisciplinary approach is essential. Management is challenging and is characterised by wide variation in treatments and lack of evidence-based therapeutic approaches. Literature review with particular regard to therapeutic approaches is performed with a view towards a cooperative treatment study.\n",
      "Neonatal hemochromatosis (NH) is a rare disease of iron metabolism that starts at intrauterine period causing liver failure and extrahepatic siderozis. The etiology of NH has not been understood exactly, yet it is accepted that a maternofetal alloimmune disorder that leads to liver failure in fetus causes the illness. The prognosis of NH is generally bad and death is inevitable if left untreated. The efficiency of chelation-antioxidant coctail used in medical treatment is between 10% and 20% and these patients frequently need liver transplantation. In our study, we presented four newborn cases diagnosed as NH and treated medically. Of the four patients, one died of pulmonary hemorrhage and another died of multiorgan failure in the first week of hospitalization. The other two patients' clinical status and laboratory parameters recovered with medical treatment. However, since liver transplantation was not carried out, one of these patients died at the age of two and a half months and the other at eighth month due to sepsis. In this study, we would like to emphasize the importance of early liver transplantation in patients recovered with medical treatment.\n",
      "We describe a family that segregated an autosomal dominant form of craniosynostosis characterized by variable expression and limited extra-cranial features. Linkage analysis and genome sequencing were performed to identify the underlying genetic mutation. A c.443C>T missense mutation in MSX2, which predicts p.Pro148Leu was identified and segregated with the disease in all affected family members. One other family with autosomal dominant craniosynostosis (Boston type) has been reported to have a missense mutation in MSX2. These data confirm that missense mutations altering the proline at codon 148 of MSX2 cause dominantly inherited craniosynostosis.\n",
      "We present clinical, radiological, biochemical, and genetic findings on six patients from two consanguineous families that show EDS-like features and radiological findings of a mild skeletal dysplasia. The EDS-like findings comprise hyperelastic, thin, and bruisable skin, hypermobility of the small joints with a tendency to contractures, protuberant eyes with bluish sclerae, hands with finely wrinkled palms, atrophy of the thenar muscles, and tapering fingers. The skeletal dysplasia comprises platyspondyly with moderate short stature, osteopenia, and widened metaphyses. Patients have an increased ratio of total urinary pyridinolines, lysyl pyridinoline/hydroxylysyl pyridinoline (LP/HP), of approximately 1 as opposed to approximately 6 in EDS VI or approximately 0.2 in controls. Lysyl and prolyl residues of collagens were underhydroxylated despite normal lysyl hydroxylase and prolyl 4-hydroxylase activities; underhydroxylation was a generalized process as shown by mass spectrometry of the alpha1(I)- and alpha2(I)-chain-derived peptides of collagen type I and involved at least collagen types I and II. A genome-wide SNP scan and sequence analyses identified in all patients a homozygous c.483_491 del9 SLC39A13 mutation that encodes for a membrane-bound zinc transporter SLC39A13. We hypothesize that an increased Zn(2+) content inside the endoplasmic reticulum competes with Fe(2+), a cofactor that is necessary for hydroxylation of lysyl and prolyl residues, and thus explains the biochemical findings. These data suggest an entity that we have designated \"spondylocheiro dysplastic form of EDS (SCD-EDS)\" to indicate a generalized skeletal dysplasia involving mainly the spine (spondylo) and striking clinical abnormalities of the hands (cheiro) in addition to the EDS-like features.\n",
      "Seven related patients had a progressive pigmentary retinal degeneration, characterized by nyctalopia, visual field restriction, and cystic macular degeneration in younger patients and a macula of nonspecific atrophic appearance in older patients. In addition, each patient had high hyperopia (+9.50 to +16.00) and nanophthalmos (axial lengths, less than 20 mm), with diffuse choroidal thickening on ultrasound. Younger patients had slitlike anterior chamber angles; older patients developed progressive synechial angle closure and eventual glaucoma. Chromosomes were normal. On electroretinographic testing, younger patients had absent rod signals, with normal cone wave form and near-normal b-wave amplitudes but markedly delayed cone b-wave implicit times; older patients had severely diminished or extinguished electroretinograms. This family appears to represent a newly recognized autosomal-recessive syndrome.\n",
      "We present two cases of familial adult medullary cystic disease with spastic quadriparesis, an association not previously described. Previous extrarenal associations of the nephronophthisis-medullary cystic disease complex were reported exclusively in childhood cases. Both patients have undergone successful cadaveric renal transplantation, with no evidence of their renal disease recurring. Further work is needed to elucidate the complex genetics of nephronophthisis.\n",
      "Disproportionate short stature refers to a heterogeneous group of hereditary disorders that are classified according to their mode of inheritance, clinical skeletal and nonskeletal manifestations, and radiological characteristics. In the present study, we report on an autosomal-recessive osteocutaneous disorder that we termed SOFT (short stature, onychodysplasia, facial dysmorphism, and hypotrichosis) syndrome. We employed homozygosity mapping to locate the disease-causing mutation to region 3p21.1-3p21.31. Using whole-exome-sequencing analysis complemented with Sanger direct sequencing of poorly covered regions, we identified a homozygous point mutation (c.512T>C [p.Leu171Pro]) in POC1A (centriolar protein homolog A). This mutation was found to cosegregate with the disease phenotype in two families. The p.Leu171Pro substitution affects a highly conserved amino acid residue and is predicted to interfere with protein function. Poc1, a POC1A ortholog, was previously found to have a role in centrosome stability in unicellular organisms. Accordingly, although centrosome structure was preserved, the number of centrosomes and their distribution were abnormal in affected cells. In addition, the Golgi apparatus presented a dispersed morphology, cholera-toxin trafficking from the plasma membrane to the Golgi was aberrant, and large vesicles accumulated in the cytosol. Collectively, our data underscore the importance of POC1A for proper bone, hair, and nail formation and highlight the importance of normal centrosomes in Golgi assembly and trafficking from the plasma membrane to the Golgi apparatus.\n",
      "We identified four girls with a consistent constellation of facial dysmorphism and malformations previously reported in a single mother-daughter pair. Toe syndactyly, telecanthus and anogenital and renal malformations were present in all affected individuals; thus, we propose the name 'STAR syndrome' for this disorder. Using array CGH, qPCR and sequence analysis, we found causative mutations in FAM58A on Xq28 in all affected individuals, suggesting an X-linked dominant inheritance pattern for this recognizable syndrome.\n",
      "Two siblings of consanguineous Arab parents were found to have cystic fibrosis and gastritis associated with Helicobacter pylori, folate deficiency megaloblastic anaemia, subnormal mentality and minor anomalies. The association of H. pylori and megaloblastic anaemia has not been described in patients with cystic fibrosis. H. pylori infection and gastritis is probably more common in patients with cystic fibrosis than appreciated. We believe that the constellation of features in the two sibs represent a possible new autosomal recessive cystic fibrosis-like syndrome.\n",
      "We have observed in two different families two pairs of male siblings born from normal, non-consanguineous parents having the same syndrome, characterized by severe cerebral white matter hypoplasia, agenesis or extreme hypoplasia of the corpus callosum, mental retardation, failure to thrive and minor midline facial abnormalities. This seems to be a previously unreported genetic syndrome.\n",
      "We describe a new familial syndrome in three siblings; it is biochemically characterized by a combined defect of the action of the three related peptides insulin, insulin-like growth factor I (IGF I) and epidermal growth factor (EGF). Clinically, the disease has features of Werner syndrome with lipodystrophy, scleroderma-like alterations of the skin, alterations of the skeleton and contractures of joints. In addition, one of the patients has an insulin-resistant diabetes mellitus. Studies with cultured fibroblasts obtained from skin biopsies show a markedly reduced stimulation of RNA synthesis by the three growth factors and a decreased insulin stimulation of 2-deoxy-D-glucose uptake as compared with normal controls. Receptor binding of the three peptides occurred with normal capacity and affinity. We conclude that the signal transfer of different growth factors has a common denominator at the postreceptor level.\n",
      "The Dandy-Walker malformation and craniosynostosis have each been described as isolated occurrences and as components of multiple malformation syndromes. The purpose of this report is to delineate the characteristics of a multiple malformation syndrome of Dandy-Walker malformation and sagittal craniosynostosis. The inheritance pattern appears to be autosomal dominant.\n",
      "A mother and daughter with an overlapping Catel-Manzke and Temtamy preaxial brachydactyly hyperphalangism syndrome phenotype are reported. We describe a phenotype with a previously undescribed genetic basis. .\n",
      "Four siblings in a family with a highly consanguineous background presented with an unusual combination of spastic paraparesis, muscle wasting, microcephaly, mental retardation, skeletal deformities, and cutaneous manifestations, ie, hypopigmented and hyperpigmented lesions and graying of the hair. An extensive workup including electromyography, muscle biopsy, and chromosomal analysis was unrewarding. An autosomal recessive inheritance is probable. A similar entity was recently reported from israel. The possibility that this previously unrecognized condition represents a new syndrome is suggested.\n",
      "Varicella-zoster infections commonly are seen in clinical practice; however, Ramsay Hunt syndrome caused by reactivation of latent varicella-zoster virus in the geniculate ganglion is rare. We report the case of a 30-year-old woman who developed Ramsay Hunt syndrome and also review the characteristic features of this disease.\n",
      "The spectrum of RYR1 mutation associated disease encompasses congenital myopathies, exercise induced rhabdomyolysis, malignant hyperthermia susceptibility and King-Denborough syndrome. We report the clinical phenotype of two siblings who presented in infancy with hypotonia and striking fatigable ptosis. Their response to pyridostigimine was striking, but genetic screening for congenital myasthenic syndromes was negative, prompting further evaluation. Muscle MRI was abnormal with a selective pattern of involvement evocative of RYR1-related myopathy. This directed sequencing of the RYR1 gene, which revealed two heterozygous c.6721C>T (p.Arg2241X) nonsense mutations and novel c.8888T>C (p.Leu2963Pro) mutations in both siblings. These cases broaden the RYR1-related disease spectrum to include a myasthenic-like phenotype, including partial response to pyridostigimine. RYR1-related myopathy should be considered in the presence of fatigable weakness especially if muscle imaging demonstrates structural abnormalities. Single fibre electromyography can also be helpful in cases like this.\n",
      "In ‚àº30% of families affected by colorectal adenomatous polyposis, no germline mutations have been identified in the previously implicated genes APC, MUTYH, POLE, POLD1, and NTHL1, although a hereditary etiology is likely. To uncover further genes with high-penetrance causative mutations, we performed exome sequencing of leukocyte DNA from 102 unrelated individuals with unexplained adenomatous polyposis. We identified two unrelated individuals with differing compound-heterozygous loss-of-function (LoF) germline mutations in the mismatch-repair gene MSH3. The impact of the MSH3 mutations (c.1148delA, c.2319-1G>A, c.2760delC, and c.3001-2A>C) was indicated at the RNA and protein levels. Analysis of the diseased individuals' tumor tissue demonstrated high microsatellite instability of di- and tetranucleotides (EMAST), and immunohistochemical staining illustrated a complete loss of nuclear MSH3 in normal and tumor tissue, confirming the LoF effect and causal relevance of the mutations. The pedigrees, genotypes, and frequency of MSH3 mutations in the general population are consistent with an autosomal-recessive mode of inheritance. Both index persons have an affected sibling carrying the same mutations. The tumor spectrum in these four persons comprised colorectal and duodenal adenomas, colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, and an early-onset astrocytoma. Additionally, we detected one unrelated individual with biallelic PMS2 germline mutations, representing constitutional mismatch-repair deficiency. Potentially causative variants in 14 more candidate genes identified in 26 other individuals require further workup. In the present study, we identified biallelic germline MSH3 mutations in individuals with a suspected hereditary tumor syndrome. Our data suggest that MSH3 mutations represent an additional recessive subtype of colorectal adenomatous polyposis.\n",
      "Tetrasomy for the distal chromosome 15q is rare, and only 22 patients (including 6 cases without detailed information) have been described to date in the literature. Here we report on another patient with nonmosaic tetrasomy 15q25.2-qter resulted from an inverted duplication of distal chromosome 15. This patient presents with features of development delay, arachnodactyly, joint contractures and typical facial dysmorphism including frontal bossing, short palpebral fissures, long philtrum, low-set ears, high-arched palate and retrognathia. Unlike most of the related patients, abdominal ultrasound test and brain MRI showed normal. Karyotyping analysis revealed a supernumerary marker chromosome presented in all metaphase cells examined. Parental karyotyping analysis was normal, indicating a de novo chromosome aberration of the patient. SNP microarray analysis found a two copy gain of 17.7 Mb from the distal long arm of chromosome 15 (15q25.2-qter). Further FISH analysis using SureFISH 15q26.3 IGF1R probe proved an inverted duplication of distal long arm of chromosome 15. The segmental duplications which lie in the hotspots of 15q24-26 might increase the susceptibility of chromosome rearrangement. Compared with the George-Abraham' study [2012], ADAMTSL3 might be more related to the cardiac disorders in tetrasomy 15q patients. Considering all patients reported in the literature, different mosaic degrees and segmental sizes don't correlate to the severity of phenotypes. A clear delineation on tetrasomy for distal chromosome 15q could still be investigated.\n",
      "We report here on the first family with short stature and Silver-Russell-like phenotype due to a microdeletion in 12q14.3. The Netchine-Harbison clinical scoring system was used for the clinical diagnosis of Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS). The three affected first-degree relatives (index patient, mother and brother) presented with prenatal and postnatal growth retardation, feeding difficulties, a prominent forehead and a failure to thrive, but did not show relative macrocephaly. In addition, our index patient showed dysmorphic facial features, periodically increased sweating, and scoliosis. Learning problems and cardiac arrhythmia presented as additional features of her brother. Using high-resolution array-CGH, heterozygosity for a 1.67√¢‚Ç¨¬ØMb deletion in 12q14.3 was detected in the index patient. The heterozygous loss was confirmed by MLPA in the index patient and the other two affected family members. The deletion includes the genes HMGA2, LLPH, TMBIM4, IRAK3, HELB, GRIP1, and the pseudogene RPSAP52. We conclude from these results and from the data of other patients reported in the literature that haploinsufficiency of HMGA2 leads to the short stature in this family.\n",
      "The combination of Dandy-Walker malformation, other central nervous system anomalies, and postaxial polydactyly has been reported previously in two pairs of siblings. We propose the name 'Pierquin syndrome' for this combination and we report a new patient with this disorder.\n",
      "Absence or hypoplasia of the tibia has been reported to occur as an isolated hereditary malformation as well as a feature of several autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant syndromes. We report three sibs with absence or hypoplasia of the tibia in association with other malformations whose parents are first cousins once removed. These infants appear to have a \"new\" autosomal recessive syndrome.\n",
      "We present 2 cases of a previously apparently unreported spondylo-metaphyseal dysplasia comprising dwarfism, severe metaphyseal changes, ovoid vertebrae and mild platyspondyly with anterior tonguing of the vertebral bodies. The inheritance may be autosomal recessive.\n",
      "Singleton-Merten syndrome (SMS) is an autosomal-dominant multi-system disorder characterized by dental dysplasia, aortic calcification, skeletal abnormalities, glaucoma, psoriasis, and other conditions. Despite an apparent autosomal-dominant pattern of inheritance, the genetic background of SMS and information about its phenotypic heterogeneity remain unknown. Recently, we found a family affected by glaucoma, aortic calcification, and skeletal abnormalities. Unlike subjects with classic SMS, affected individuals showed normal dentition, suggesting atypical SMS. To identify genetic causes of the disease, we performed exome sequencing in this family and identified a variant (c.1118A>C [p.Glu373Ala]) of DDX58, whose protein product is also known as RIG-I. Further analysis of DDX58 in 100 individuals with congenital glaucoma identified another variant (c.803G>T [p.Cys268Phe]) in a family who harbored neither dental anomalies nor aortic calcification but who suffered from glaucoma and skeletal abnormalities. Cys268 and Glu373 residues of DDX58 belong to ATP-binding motifs I and II, respectively, and these residues are predicted to be located closer to the ADP and RNA molecules than other nonpathogenic missense variants by protein structure analysis. Functional assays revealed that DDX58 alterations confer constitutive activation and thus lead to increased interferon (IFN) activity and IFN-stimulated gene expression. In addition, when we transduced primary human trabecular meshwork cells with c.803G>T (p.Cys268Phe) and c.1118A>C (p.Glu373Ala) mutants, cytopathic effects and a significant decrease in cell number were observed. Taken together, our results demonstrate that DDX58 mutations cause atypical SMS manifesting with variable expression of glaucoma, aortic calcification, and skeletal abnormalities without dental anomalies.\n",
      "We describe a family with a novel, inherited AXIN2 mutation (c.1989G>A) segregating in an autosomal dominant pattern with oligodontia and variable other findings including colonic polyposis, gastric polyps, a mild ectodermal dysplasia phenotype with sparse hair and eyebrows, and early onset colorectal and breast cancers. This novel mutation predicts p.Trp663X, which is a truncated protein that is missing the last three exons, including the DIX (Disheveled and AXIN interacting) domain. This nonsense mutation is predicted to destroy the inhibitory action of AXIN2 on WNT signaling. Previous authors have described an unrelated family with autosomal dominant oligodontia and a variable colorectal phenotype segregating with a nonsense mutation of AXIN2, as well as a frameshift AXIN2 mutation in an unrelated individual with oligodontia. Our report provides additional evidence supporting an autosomal dominant AXIN2-associated ectodermal dysplasia and neoplastic syndrome.\n",
      "Two of 5 children in one family presented with unique facies, proportionate small stature and sensorineural deafness-mutism. One of the children who had a history of recurrent infections, was shown to have a defect of leukocyte chemotaxis. Although impairment of chemotaxis could not be demonstrated in the other affected sibling, it is unlikely that the association of a previously undescribed syndrome and a rare disorder of chemotaxis is a chance occurrence.\n",
      "We present a novel, likely autosomal recessive, multi-system disorder seen in three siblings, two males and one female, born to nonconsanguineous parents. The disease manifests as agammaglobulinemia with marked microcephaly, significant developmental delay, craniosynostosis, a severe dermatitis, cleft palate, narrowing of the choanae, and blepharophimosis. The constellation of clinical signs seen in this family likely represents a new and recognizable form of agammaglobulinemia due to a defect in early B-cell maturation.\n",
      "KCNH1 encodes a voltage-gated potassium channel that is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system. Mutations in this gene were recently found to be responsible for Temple-Baraitser Syndrome (TMBTS) and Zimmermann-Laband syndrome (ZLS).Here, we report a new case of TMBTS diagnosed in a Lebanese child. Whole genome sequencing was carried out on DNA samples of the proband and his parents to identify mutations associated with this disease. Sanger sequencing was performed to confirm the presence of detected variants.Whole genome sequencing revealed three missense mutations in TMBTS patient: c.1042G‚Äâ>‚ÄâA in KCNH1, c.2131¬†T‚Äâ>‚ÄâC in STK36, and c.726C‚Äâ>‚ÄâA in ZNF517. According to all predictors, mutation in KCNH1 is damaging de novo mutation that results in substitution of Glycine by Arginine, i.e., p.(Gly348Arg). This mutation was already reported in a patient with ZLS that could affect the connecting loop between helices S4-S5 of KCNH1 with a gain of function effect.Our findings demonstrate that KCNH1 mutations cause TMBTS and expand the mutational spectrum of KCNH1 in TMBTS. In addition, all cases of TMBTS were reviewed and compared to ZLS. We suggest that the two syndromes are a continuum and that the variability in the phenotypes is the result of the involvement of genetic modifiers.\n",
      "We report on a mother and son with a similar facies characterized by a square forehead, small nose, telecanthus, and thin upper lip. They both had a similar metacarpal-phalangeal profile characterized by marked brachytelephalangy. They were both short in comparison to other family members, and the son had hypogonadotropic-hypogonadism and anosmia. We favor the hypothesis of a single autosomal dominant gene with variable expression of the hypogonadism and anosmia, although there are alternative explanations for the combination.\n",
      "Keppen-Lubinsky syndrome (KPLBS) is a rare disease mainly characterized by severe developmental delay and intellectual disability, microcephaly, large prominent eyes, a narrow nasal bridge, a tented upper lip, a high palate, an open mouth, tightly adherent skin, an aged appearance, and severe generalized lipodystrophy. We sequenced the exomes of three unrelated individuals affected by KPLBS and found de novo heterozygous mutations in KCNJ6 (GIRK2), which encodes an inwardly rectifying potassium channel and maps to the Down syndrome critical region between DIRK1A and DSCR4. In particular, two individuals shared an in-frame heterozygous deletion of three nucleotides (c.455_457del) leading to the loss of one amino acid (p.Thr152del). The third individual was heterozygous for a missense mutation (c.460G>A) which introduces an amino acid change from glycine to serine (p.Gly154Ser). In agreement with animal models, the present data suggest that these mutations severely impair the correct functioning of this potassium channel. Overall, these results establish KPLBS as a channelopathy and suggest that KCNJ6 (GIRK2) could also be a candidate gene for other lipodystrophies. We hope that these results will prompt investigations in this unexplored class of inwardly rectifying K(+) channels.\n",
      "The ubiquitously expressed iron storage protein ferritin plays a central role in maintaining cellular iron homeostasis. Cytosolic ferritins are composed of heavy (H) and light (L) subunits that co-assemble into a hollow spherical shell with an internal cavity where iron is stored. The ferroxidase activity of the ferritin H chain is critical to store iron in its Fe3+ oxidation state, while the L chain shows iron nucleation properties. We describe a unique case of a 23-yr-old female patient affected by a homozygous loss of function mutation in the L-ferritin gene, idiopathic generalized seizures, and atypical restless leg syndrome (RLS). We show that L chain ferritin is undetectable in primary fibroblasts from the patient, and thus ferritin consists only of H chains. Increased iron incorporation into the FtH homopolymer leads to reduced cellular iron availability, diminished levels of cytosolic catalase, SOD1 protein levels, enhanced ROS production and higher levels of oxidized proteins. Importantly, key phenotypic features observed in fibroblasts are also mirrored in reprogrammed neurons from the patient's fibroblasts. Our results demonstrate for the first time the pathophysiological consequences of L-ferritin deficiency in a human and help to define the concept for a new disease entity hallmarked by idiopathic generalized seizure and atypical RLS.\n",
      "UNLABELLED:A new X-linked variant of spondylo-epimetaphyseal dysplasia with distinctive phenotype and severe mental retardation in three boys of one family is reported. The children were normal at birth. After several months of normal development progressive physical disability and slow mental deterioration were observed. Extensive biochemical tests were normal. CONCLUSION:These patients represent a new form of X-linked spondylo-epimetaphyseal dysplasia.\n",
      "A new megathrombocytopenic syndrome with giant platelets in peripheral blood and severe thrombocytopenia was diagnosed in a 4-month-old boy. His clinical course included repeated hemorrhagic incidents leading to death at age 37 months. Bone marrow ultrastructural analysis revealed numerous dystrophic megakaryocytes with giant membrane complexes. Although these features were similar to those described for megakaryocytes in mice lacking the gene for transcription factor p45-NF-E2, no abnormalities in the p45-NF-E2 gene could be documented. Platelet membrane analysis showed a reduction in glycoprotein (GP) Ib, but normal content of GPIIb and GPIIIa. Analysis of genes encoding for GPIb alpha and beta, GPV, and GPIX ruled out the possibility that the observed platelet abnormality is a variant of Bernard-Soulier syndrome. A moderate neutropenia was associated with a complete lack of expression of sialyl-Lewis-X on the surface of polymorphonuclear neutrophils. A common defect in posttranslational modification of glycoproteins could account for the diverse cellular abnormalities.\n",
      "Sex chromosome aneuploidies occur in approximately one in 420 live births. The most frequent abnormalities are 45,X (Turner syndrome), 47,XXX (triple X), 47,XXY (Klinefelter syndrome), and 47,XYY. The prevalence of males with more than one extra sex chromosome (e.g. 48,XXYY or 48,XXXY) is less common. However, the literature provides little information about the cognitive and behavioural phenotype and the natural history of the disease. We report the clinical, neurocognitive, social cognitive and psychiatric characterization of a patient with 49,XYYYY syndrome.The patient presented with a complex phenotype including a particular cognitive profile with intellectual deficiency and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) with limited interests. Moreover, social anxiety disorder with selective mutism and separation anxiety disorder were observed (DSM-5 criteria, MINI Assessment).It is now admitted that 49,XYYYY has unique medical, neurodevelopmental and behavioural characteristics. Interestingly, ASD is more common in groups with Y chromosome aneuploidy. This clinical report suggests that understanding the cognitive and social functioning of these patients may provide new insights into possible therapeutic strategies, as cognitive remediation or social cognitive training.\n",
      "Vohwinkel syndrome or keratoderma hereditaria mutilans is a rare autosomal dominant palmoplantar keratosis, which manifests in infants and becomes more evident in adulthood. Its mode of inheritance is autosomal dominant with mutation in loricrin and Connexin 26 genes. Patients with this mutation present hyperkeratosis of the palms and soles, constricting bands of the digits, usually on the fifth, and starfish-shaped hyperkeratosis on the dorsal aspects of the hands and feet. The disease mostly occurs in white women, where constricting fibrous bands appear on the digits and can lead to progressive strangulation and auto-amputation (pseudo-ain-hum).The authors report a rare case of a patient with a clinical ichthyosiform variant of Vohwinkel syndrome.\n",
      "Two sibs, one girl and one boy, were observed in infancy with a severe lethal skeletal dysplasia syndrome that radiologically and histologically resembled Kniest dysplasia but clearly differed in clinical course and inheritance. Kniest dysplasia is a nonlethal syndrome, whereas both of these infants died in the neonatal period. Kniest dysplasia appears to be inherited as an autosomal dominant trait; the likely transmission in this family was autosomal recessive. Roentgenograms revealed dumbbell-shaped long bones superficially similar to Kniest dysplasia, but with markedly shortened diaphyses and metaphyseal irregularities. Chondro-osseous morphology demonstrated a superficially similar foamy \"Swiss cheese\" appearance to the cartilage matrix, as seen in Kniest dysplasia, but there were distinctly different changes in the growth plate and resting cartilage. Ultrastructurally, the chondrocytic endoplasmic reticulum was found to have an appearance different from that observed in either normal or Kniest cartilage. These cases likely represent a distinct chondrodysplasia.\n",
      "Infantile-onset ascending spastic paralysis (OMIM #607225) is a rare autosomal recessive early onset motor neuron disease caused by mutations in the gene ALS2. We report on a splice acceptor site mutation in intron 9 of ALS2 (IVS9-2A>T) in a German patient from nonconsanguineous parents. The mutation results in skipping of exon 10. This causes a frame-shift in exon 11 and a premature stop codon. Analysis of the parental ALS2 gene revealed heterozygosity for the mutation in the mother but not in the father. Therefore, we studied polymorphic markers scattered along chromosome 2 in both parents and the patient and found maternal uniparental disomy in the patient. While homozygosity was observed at several loci of chromosome 2 including ALS2, other loci were heterozygous, i.e., both maternal alleles were present. The findings can be explained by at least four recombination events during maternal meiosis followed by a meiosis I error and postzygotic trisomy rescue or gamete complementation.\n",
      "We describe a 2-month-old girl with congenital anomalies including facial anomalies, complex cardiac anomalies, polysyndactyly, dysgenesis of distal extremities and bilateral multiple renal cysts. The proband was the child of first-cousin parents. Clinical synopsis in Bonneau syndrome (OMIM: 263630) is polysyndactyly and cardiac malformation. In addition, liver anomalies were reported in two patients. We discuss polysyndactyly and cardiac malformation with bilateral multiple renal cysts, a combination not reported previously.\n",
      "Choroideremia is a rare X-linked, progressive, degenerative disease of the retina and choroid. We describe 2 patients, one a female, with choroideremia documented to have hypopituitarism and neurological abnormalities. We hypothesize that this previously undescribed association results from a degenerative process involving tissues of neural origin, or from contiguous submicroscopic gene deletions in the X chromosome region that define choroideremia and possibly hypopituitarism.\n",
      "Autoimmune cytopenia is a frequent manifestation of primary immunodeficiencies. Two siblings presented with Evans syndrome, viral infections, and progressive leukopenia. DNA available from one patient showed a homozygous frameshift mutation in tripeptidyl peptidase II (TPP2) abolishing protein expression. TPP2 is a serine exopeptidase involved in extralysosomal peptide degradation. Its deficiency in mice activates cell death programs and premature senescence. Similar to cells from na√Øve, uninfected TPP2-deficient mice, patient cells showed increased major histocompatibility complex I expression and most CD8(+) T-cells had a senescent CCR7-CD127(-)CD28(-)CD57(+) phenotype with poor proliferative responses and enhanced staurosporine-induced apoptosis. T-cells showed increased expression of the effector molecules perforin and interferon-Œ≥ with high expression of the transcription factor T-bet. Age-associated B-cells with a CD21(-) CD11c(+) phenotype expressing T-bet were increased in humans and mice, combined with antinuclear antibodies. Moreover, markers of senescence were also present in human and murine TPP2-deficient fibroblasts. Telomere lengths were normal in patient fibroblasts and granulocytes, and low normal in lymphocytes, which were compatible with activation of stress-induced rather than replicative senescence programs. TPP2 deficiency is the first primary immunodeficiency linking premature immunosenescence to severe autoimmunity. Determination of senescent lymphocytes should be part of the diagnostic evaluation of children with refractory multilineage cytopenias.\n",
      "Efforts to understand the genetic basis of mental retardation are greatly assisted by the identification of families with multiple relatives with mental retardation that clinical geneticists encounter in the routine practice of their profession. Here we describe a linkage study of a four generation family in which X linked recessive mental retardation (XLMR) is associated with minor dysmorphism and premature death of the affected males. Microsatellite based polymorphic loci evenly spaced over the entire X chromosome were used initially to detect linkage to Xq28. Further analysis identified a haplotype of Xq28 markers bounded proximally by locus DXS1113 and distally by DXS1108 that cosegregated with XLMR in this family. Two point lod scores > 3.0 provided strong evidence that the gene locus responsible for XLMR in this family is within this 7 Mb region of Xq28. The minor anomalies noted in some affected males were not distinctive enough to suggest a unique syndrome. None of our patients had features of the Waisman-Laxova syndrome or the PPM-X syndrome. The possibility of allelism with any of the five other non-specific XLMR syndromes (MRX3, MRX16, MRX25, MRX28, and MRX41) mapped to Xq28 could not be excluded. While the recognition of a gene responsible for this disorder needs much additional work, multiple female relatives at risk in this family benefit immediately from knowing their genotype and heterozygotes will have the opportunity to undergo prenatal diagnosis.\n",
      "We identified a family with 10 affected members in four generations suffering from adult-onset progressive sinoatrial and atrioventricular conduction disease, sudden death due to ventricular tachyarrhythmia, dilated cardiomyopathy, and a unique type of brachydactyly with mild hand involvement (short distal, middle, proximal phalanges and clinodactyly) and more severe foot involvement (short distal, proximal phalanges and metatarsal bones, short or absent middle phalanges, terminal symphalangism, duplication of the bases of the second metatarsals, extra ossicles, and syndactyly). The phenotype differences from other reported genetic abnormalities and linkage exclusion of Holt-Oram syndrome, ulnar-mammary syndrome, brachydactyly type B or Robinow syndrome, and cardiac conduction disease or Brugada syndrome loci suggest that we report on a new hereditary heart-hand syndrome.\n",
      "The TARP syndrome (Talipes equinovarus, Atrial septal defect, Robin sequence, and Persistent left superior vena cava) is an X-linked disorder that was determined to be caused by mutations in RBM10 in two families, and confirmed in a subsequent case report. The first two original families were quite similar in phenotype, with uniform early lethality although a confirmatory case report showed survival into childhood. Here we report on five affecteds from three newly recognized families, including patients with atypical manifestations. None of the five patients had talipes and others also lacked cardinal TARP features of Robin sequence and atrial septal defect. All three families demonstrated de novo mutations, and one of the families had two recurrences, with demonstrable maternal mosaicism.\n",
      "Two brothers with ichthyosis follicularis, noncicatricial universal alopecia, photophobia, hyerkeratotic psoriasis-like lesions, nails dystrophy, inguineal herniae, cryptorchidism, short stature, seizures, and psychomotor developmental delay are described. These features correspond to the ichthyosis follicularis, alopecia, photophobia (IFAP) syndrome. The youngest brother had in addition a bilateral absence of 4th fingers and camptodactyly, features never reported in patients with IFAP syndromes.\n",
      "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder caused by survival motor neuron gene mutations. Variant forms of SMA accompanied by additional clinical presentations have been classified as atypical SMA and are thought to be caused by variants in as yet unidentified causative genes. Here, we presented the clinical findings of two siblings with an SMA variant followed by progressive cerebral atrophy, and the results of whole-exome sequencing analyses of the family quartet that was performed to identify potential causative variants. We identified two candidate homozygous missense variants, R942Q in the tubulin-folding cofactor D (TBCD) gene and H250Q in the bromo-adjacent homology domain and coiled-coil containing 1 (BAHCC1) gene, located on chromosome 17q25.3 with an interval of 1.4√¢‚Ç¨‚Ä∞Mbp. The in silico analysis of both variants suggested that TBCD rather than BAHCC1 was likely the pathogenic gene (TBCD sensitivity, 0.68; specificity, 0.97; BAHCC1 sensitivity, 1.00; specificity, 0.00). Thus, our results show that TBCD is a likely novel candidate gene for atypical SMA with progressive cerebral atrophy. TBCD is predicted to have important functions on tubulin integrity in motor neurons as well as in the central nervous system.\n",
      "A male infant was found to have bilateral exudative retinopathy at 6 months of age. A month later severe aplastic anaemia was diagnosed, eventually leading to the infant's death. Additional features of this seemingly new syndrome were intrauterine growth retardation, fine sparse hair, fine reticulate skin pigmentation, ataxia because of cerebellar hypoplasia, cerebral calcifications, extensor hypertonia, and progressive psychomotor retardation.\n",
      "Three members of a nuclear family were affected by split hands and feet or syndactyly, obstructive urinary anomalies and spina bifida or diaphragmatic defect.\n",
      "Genetic defects in MOGS, the gene encoding mannosyl-oligosaccharide glucosidase (the first enzyme in the processing pathway of N-linked oligosaccharide), cause the rare congenital disorder of glycosylation type IIb (CDG-IIb), also known as MOGS-CDG. MOGS is expressed in the endoplasmic reticulum and is involved in the trimming of N-glycans. We evaluated two siblings with CDG-IIb who presented with multiple neurologic complications and a paradoxical immunologic phenotype characterized by severe hypogammaglobulinemia but limited clinical evidence of an infectious diathesis. A shortened immunoglobulin half-life was determined to be the mechanism underlying the hypogammaglobulinemia. Impaired viral replication and cellular entry may explain a decreased susceptibility to infections.\n",
      "Syndromes with smooth muscle dysmotility are uncommon, and may be related either to smooth muscle myopathy, or to neuropathy. In most instances, neuropathic visceral dysmotility is an isolated finding leading to chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction syndrome (CIPO). We report here on two sibs, born to consanguineous parents, with neuropathic visceral dysmotility and CNS anomalies. They share facial dysmorphia, neurogenic megacystis, intracerebral calcifications, and developmental delay. The elder one, a girl, has microcephaly and multicystic kidneys, and her brother has a more extensive neuropathic visceral disorder leading clinically to CIPO. CIPO associated with megacystis is relatively frequent but is rarely associated with mental retardation. The cases reported in the literature are different from those described here, clinically and histologically. A recessively inherited form of CIPO associated with widespread intra-cerebral calcifications, malabsorption is known as Cockel syndrome. Severity of Cockel syndrome, absence of urinary tract involvement and neuropathologic discrepancies allow distinction with the disorder reported here. In conclusion, the two siblings described here have facial dysmorphia, vesical and (in one of them) intestinal neurogenic dysmotility, intracerebral calcifications and developmental delay that could represent a specific, recessively inherited form of CIPO.\n",
      "Muscular hypertrophy is a very rare finding on foetal ultrasonography. We present a case with recurrent muscular hypertrophy, liver enlargement and polyhydramnios in two pregnancies. One pregnancy was terminated due to suspicion of a storage disease, whereas the other led to delivery of a boy with muscular hypertrophy and mildly retarded psychomotor development. Array-CGH identified a small duplication of 7q36.3 including the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) gene in both the aborted foetus and the live born male sib. Neither of the parents carried the 7q36.3 duplication. The consequences of overexpression of SHH in humans are not elucidated, but animal studies have suggested its importance in muscular hypertrophy. We suggest that the clinical findings in the presented case might be explained by the duplication and presumed overexpression of SHH.\n",
      "OBJECTIVES:The authors carried out clinical, histopathologic, immunocytochemical, electrophysiologic, and imaging investigations and molecular genetic analysis in seven patients with distal myopathy belonging to a Finnish family. RESULTS:The disease showed autosomal dominant inheritance. Age at onset ranged from 32 to 45 years. The first symptoms for referral were clumsiness with the hands and frequent stumbling from a steppage gait. Muscle weakness was characterized by early involvement of the small muscles of the hands, gluteus medium, and both anterior and posterior muscle compartments of the legs. The disease progressed to involve other intrinsic muscles of the hands, as well as the forearm muscles, triceps and infraspinatus, and proximal lower limbs. Asymmetry of muscle involvement was common. EMG showed myopathic features, serum CK was normal or slightly elevated, and muscle biopsy showed many rimmed vacuoles and dystrophic changes. There was no evidence of linkage to Welander distal myopathy or tibial muscular dystrophy loci. CONCLUSION:These patients may have a distinct distal myopathy. Genome-wide scan is undertaken in order to identify the disease locus.\n",
      "A malformation syndrome affecting a mother and her three daughters is reported. The patients showed various combinations of the following malformations and anomalies: spontaneously arrested communicating hydrocephalus, costovertebral dysplasia, Sprengel anomaly (undescended scapula), hypertelorism, broad and low nasal bridge, anteverted nostrils, low-set ears, high-arched palate, prominent mandibula, enamel hypoplasia and increased interspace between the 1st and 2nd toes. The occurrence of similar abnormalities in the mother and her three daughters and the variable expression of the manifestations indicate that the syndrome was inherited as an autosomal dominant trait.\n",
      "Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling is fundamentally important for tissue homeostasis through EGFR/ligand interactions that stimulate numerous signal transduction pathways. Aberrant EGFR signaling has been reported in inflammatory and malignant diseases, but thus far no primary inherited defects in EGFR have been recorded. Using whole-exome sequencing, we identified a homozygous loss-of-function missense mutation in EGFR (c.1283√¢‚Ç¨‚Ä∞G>A; p.Gly428Asp) in a male infant with lifelong inflammation affecting the skin, bowel, and lungs. During the first year of life, his skin showed erosions, dry scale, and alopecia. Subsequently, there were numerous papules and pustules--similar to the rash seen in patients receiving EGFR inhibitor drugs. Skin biopsy demonstrated an altered cellular distribution of EGFR in the epidermis with reduced cell membrane labeling, and in vitro analysis of the mutant receptor revealed abrogated EGFR phosphorylation and EGF-stimulated downstream signaling. Microarray analysis on the patient's skin highlighted disturbed differentiation/premature terminal differentiation of keratinocytes and upregulation of several inflammatory/innate immune response networks. The boy died at the age of 2.5 years from extensive skin and chest infections as well as electrolyte imbalance. This case highlights the major mechanism of epithelial dysfunction following EGFR signaling ablation and illustrates the broader impact of EGFR inhibition on other tissues.\n",
      "Ectodermal dysplasia syndromes are genetically heterogeneous group of disorders involving one or more of the classical ectodermal appendages (hair, nail, teeth, sweat glands) in association with anomalies of other organs or systems. In the present study a novel form of ectodermal dysplasia syndrome, ectodermal dysplasia cutaneous syndactyly (EDCS), segregating in an autosomal recessive pattern in a Pakistani family was investigated. The clinical features of the affected individuals included large prominent ear pinnae, tooth enamel hypoplasia, hypoplastic nails, bilateral partial cutaneous syndactyly, hypotrichosis, palmoplantar keratoderma and hyperhidrosis. Through genetic linkage study, EDCS syndrome was mapped on human chromosome 7p21.1-p14.3 flanked by markers D7S488 and D7S817. A maximum two-point LOD score of 2.94 (theta = 0.00) was obtained at marker D7S2496 while a maximum multipoint LOD score of 3.07 was obtained with several markers along the disease-interval. This interval spans 19.80-cM, which corresponds to 13.74-Mbp according to the sequence-based physical map (Build 36.1). Sequence analysis of 27 candidate genes, located in the candidate interval, did not reveal any functional sequence variant.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Heterozygous mutations in the COL1A1 or COL1A2 gene encoding the alpha1 and alpha2 chain of type I collagen generally cause either osteogenesis imperfecta or the arthrochalasis form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS). Homozygous or compound heterozygous COL1A2 mutations resulting in complete deficiency of the proalpha2(I) collagen chains are extremely rare and have been reported in only a few patients, albeit with variable phenotypic outcome. METHODS: The clinical features of the proband, a 6 year old boy, were recorded. Analysis of proalpha and alpha-collagen chains was performed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using the Laemmli buffer system. Single stranded conformation polymorphism analysis of the proband's DNA was also carried out. RESULTS: In this report we show that complete lack of proalpha2(I) collagen chains can present as a phenotype reminiscent of mild hypermobility EDS during childhood. CONCLUSIONS: Biochemical analysis of collagens extracted from skin fibroblasts is a powerful tool to detect the subset of patients with complete absence of proalpha2(I) collagen chains, and in these patients, careful cardiac follow up with ultrasonography is highly recommended because of the risk for cardiac valvular problems in adulthood.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE:To use linkage analysis and whole exome sequencing to identify the genetic mutation in a multigenerational Australian family with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2 (CMT2) and pyramidal signs. METHODS:Genome-wide linkage analysis was performed to map the locus. Whole exome sequencing was undertaken on selected individuals (3 affected, 1 normal), and segregation analysis and mutation screening were carried out using high-resolution melt analysis. The GEM.app database was queried to identify additional families with mutations. RESULTS:Significant linkage (2-point LOD score‚Äâ‚â•‚Äâ+3) and haplotype analysis mapped a new locus for CMT2 and pyramidal signs to a 6.6Mb interval on chromosome 22q12.1-q12.3. Whole exome sequencing identified a novel mutation (p.R252W) in the microrchidia CW-type zinc finger 2 (MORC2) gene mapping within the linkage region. The mutation fully segregated with the disease phenotype in the family. Screening additional families and querying unsolved CMT2 exomes, we identified the p.R252W mutation in 2 unrelated early onset CMT2 families and a second mutation p.E236G in 2 unrelated CMT2 families. Both the mutations occurred at highly conserved amino acid residues and were absent in the normal population. INTERPRETATION:We have identified a new locus in which MORC2 mutations are the likely pathogenic cause of CMT2 and pyramidal signs in these families. MORC2 encodes the human CW-type zinc finger 2 protein, which is a chromatin modifier involved in the regulation of DNA repair as well as gene transcription.\n",
      "A family with hereditary nephritis, sensorineural hearing loss, macrocephaly, and mental retardation is reported. X-linked recessive inheritance was suggested by the presence of two affected brothers and a maternal uncle. This association may be a previously unreported variant of Alport's syndrome.\n",
      "Most previous cases of unilateral terminal transverse defects of the hand have not been familial. Several previously reported cases of apparent autosomal dominant inheritance of such defects have subsequently been reclassified as type B brachydactyly. We report a pair of adult twin women with unilateral terminal transverse defects affecting the left hand in one woman and the right hand in the other woman. The latter woman has one daughter with a unilateral terminal transverse defect affecting the left hand. The hand anomaly is characterized by absence of the terminal portions of digits 2 to 5 with a mildly hypoplastic thumb (adactylia). Tiny nail remnants are evident on the remaining digital stumps, and no soft tissue syndactyly is apparent. At 2 years of age, the daughter has hypoplastic first, fourth, and fifth metacarpals with no ossification of the second or third metacarpals or any of the phalanges. The affected mother has hypoplastic metacarpals for digits 2 to 4 and a vestigial fifth proximal phalanx on the affected hand, with no other phalanges evident by roentgenogram other than those of the thumb. The mother's twin sister has similar findings, except the ossified phalangeal remnant is on her second and third fingers rather than her fifth finger. Doppler flow arterial patterns appeared normal in each hand of affected family members. The other hand and both feet are clinically and radiologically normal in each case, and the family history is negative for any other individuals with limb anomalies. A review of the literature suggests that this family may very well be unique.\n",
      "A newborn female presented on the first day of life with clinical and biochemical findings consistent with multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD). Riboflavin supplementation corrected the biochemical abnormalities 24 h after commencing the vitamin. In vitro acylcarnitine profiling in intact fibroblasts both in normal and riboflavin depleted media showed normal oxidation of fatty acids excluding defects in electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF), or ETF ubiquinone oxidoreductase (ETF:QO), or a genetic abnormality in flavin metabolism. In addition, sequencing of the genes encoding ETF and ETF:QO in the proband did not reveal any pathogenic mutations. Determination of the maternal riboflavin status after delivery showed that the mother was riboflavin deficient. Repeat testing done two years after the infant's birth and while on a normal diet showed that the mother was persistently riboflavin deficient and showed a typical MADD profile on plasma acylcarnitine testing. A possible genetic defect in riboflavin transport of metabolism in the mother is postulated to be the cause of the transient MADD seen in the infant. Sequencing of the SLC16A12, RFK and FLAD1 genes encoding key enzymes in riboflavin transport of metabolism in the mother did not identify any pathogenic mutations. The underlying molecular basis of the mother's defect in riboflavin metabolism remains to be established.\n",
      "Congenital megacalycosis is a rare renal disease characterized by calyceal dilatation without pelvic or ureteral obstruction. If not accompanied by nephrolithiasis and urinary tract infection, this disease is completely benign and does not cause renal dysfunction. We present a case of congenital megacalycosis that was diagnosed at the age of 41 (oldest case in the literature) after admitting with hematuria and acute renal dysfunction. IgA nephropathy was also diagnosed in this patient. Since renal dysfunction is not likely in these patients, if encountered; renal biopsy should be performed although technically difficult to diagnose the cause of this dysfunction.\n",
      "The Carey-Finema-Ziter syndrome (CFZS, MIM 254940) is an apparently autosomal recessively inherited disorder consisting of the combination of non-progressive congenital myopathy with Moebius and Pierre Robin sequence, facial anomalies and growth delay. Mental development has been described as normal or delayed. Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) ankylosis is the immobility of the joint caused by ankylotic fusion of the mandible to the cranial base or zygoma. It is a serious and disabling condition that may cause problems in mastication, digestion, speech, appearance, and oral hygiene. Most often is a true ankylosis of the TMJ but other pathological mechanisms are described (i.e., the fusion of the coronoid process to temporal bone or with the zygoma, or a variety of soft tissues disorders like Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva). Here we report a 2-year-old girl fitting with a clinical diagnosis of CFZS associated with a limited mouth opening in which temporomandibular joint ankylosis was suspected. Because it has been postulated that many clinical features in CFZS may only be secondary effects of brainstem anomalies and muscle weakness during development, the limited opening of the mouth observed in our patient could represent a rare clinical feature of CFZS itself. √Ç¬© 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\n",
      "The progressive myoclonus epilepsies (PMEs) are a group of predominantly recessive disorders that present with action myoclonus, tonic-clonic seizures, and progressive neurological decline. Many PMEs have similar clinical presentations yet are genetically heterogeneous, making accurate diagnosis difficult. A locus for PME was mapped in a consanguineous family with a single affected individual to chromosome 17q21. An identical-by-descent, homozygous mutation in GOSR2 (c.430G>T, p.Gly144Trp), a Golgi vesicle transport gene, was identified in this patient and in four apparently unrelated individuals. A comparison of the phenotypes in these patients defined a clinically distinct PME syndrome characterized by early-onset ataxia, action myoclonus by age 6, scoliosis, and mildly elevated serum√Ç¬†creatine kinase. This p.Gly144Trp mutation is equivalent to a loss of function and results in failure of GOSR2 protein to localize to the cis-Golgi.\n",
      "We report on a 3 years old boy with severe mental retardation, hypotonia, deafness, cerebral dysmyelination, low levels of immunoglobulin A and dysmorphic features, bearing a distal deletion of 18q: 18q21-qter. Karyotype analysis by GTG banding was performed, revealing a deletion of the distal fragment of chromosome 18q, ranging from band q21 to qter, later confirmed by Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH). Whole chromosome painting for chromosome 18 ruled out any cryptic rearrangements involving other chromosomes. An attempted therapy with growth hormone did not bring any improvement and was discontinued due to an unexplained febrile episode and overall regress of the patient.\n",
      "In 10 cases of 2p15p16.1 microdeletions reported worldwide to date, shared phenotypes included growth retardation, craniofacial and skeletal dysmorphic traits, internal organ defects, intellectual disability, nonverbal or low verbal status, abnormal muscle tone, and gross motor delays. The size of the deletions ranged from 0.3 to 5.7 Mb, where the smallest deletion involved the BCL11A, PAPOLG, and REL genes. Here we report on an 11-year-old male with a heterozygous de novo 0.2 Mb deletion containing a single gene, BCL11A, and a phenotype characterized by childhood apraxia of speech and dysarthria in the presence of general oral and gross motor dyspraxia and hypotonia as well as expressive language and mild intellectual delays. BCL11A is situated within the dyslexia susceptibility candidate region 3 (DYX3) candidate region on chromosome 2. The present case is the first to involve a single gene within the microdeletion region and a phenotype restricted to a subset of the traits observed in other cases with more extensive deletions.\n",
      "Pseudoaminopterin syndrome or aminopterin syndrome-like sine aminopterin (ASSA syndrome--OMIM 600325] is a rare autosomal recessive syndrome defined by characteristic dysmorphic features, skeletal defects, limb anomalies, cryptorchidism, and growth retardation. The syndrome owes its name to the fact that patients resemble the children exposed to aminopterin or to methotrexate, two dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors used for chemotherapy, or as an abortificient in early pregnancy. Ten patients have been described with pseudoaminopterin syndrome. Their phenotype is variable, and differs from the phenotype resulting from folic acid deprivation, leading to the notion that the pathogenesis may be more complex than simple vitamin deficiency. We report on an Algerian patient with pseudoaminopterin syndrome, review the previously reported cases and confirm that pseudoaminopterin syndrome does not result from a detectable contiguous gene imbalance as high resolution CGH array was normal in this child.\n",
      "Lateral meningocele syndrome is a rare disorder of unknown etiology, first described in 1977 and subsequently reported in nine other patients. These patients present distinctive craniofacial features and skeletal abnormalities in addition to multiple lateral meningoceles, suggesting a connective tissue disorder. Autosomal dominant inheritance is clearly suggested in one family and could explain familiar aggregation in another. We describe a simplex case of lateral meningocele syndrome with bicuspid aortic valve, supporting the hypothesis of a connective tissue basis for this disorder and further expanding the phenotype.\n",
      "The distal arthrogryposis (DA) syndromes are a distinct group of disorders characterized by contractures of two or more different body areas. More than a decade ago, we revised the classification of DAs and distinguished several new syndromes. This revision has facilitated the identification of five genes (i.e., TNNI2, TNNT3, MYH3, MYH8, and TPM2) that encode components of the contractile apparatus of fast-twitch myofibers and cause DA syndromes. We now report on the phenotypic features of a novel DA disorder characterized primarily by plantar flexion contractures in a large five-generation Utah family. Contractures of hips, elbows, wrists, and fingers were much milder though they varied in severity among affected individuals. All affected individuals had normal neurological examinations; electromyography and creatinine kinase levels were normal on selected individuals. We have tentatively labeled this condition distal arthrogryposis type 10 (DA10).\n",
      "Progressive microcephaly is a heterogeneous condition with causes including mutations in genes encoding regulators of neuronal survival. Here, we report the identification of mutations in QARS (encoding glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase [QARS]) as the causative variants in two unrelated families affected by progressive microcephaly, severe seizures in infancy, atrophy of the cerebral cortex and cerebellar vermis, and mild atrophy of the cerebellar hemispheres. Whole-exome sequencing of individuals from each family independently identified compound-heterozygous mutations in QARS as the only candidate causative variants. QARS was highly expressed in the developing fetal human cerebral cortex in many cell types. The four QARS mutations altered highly conserved amino acids, and the aminoacylation activity of QARS was significantly impaired in mutant cell lines. Variants p.Gly45Val and p.Tyr57His were located in the N-terminal domain required for QARS interaction with proteins in the multisynthetase complex and potentially with glutamine tRNA, and recombinant QARS proteins bearing either substitution showed an over 10-fold reduction in aminoacylation activity. Conversely, variants p.Arg403Trp and p.Arg515Trp, each occurring in a different family, were located in the catalytic core and completely disrupted QARS aminoacylation activity in vitro. Furthermore, p.Arg403Trp and p.Arg515Trp rendered QARS less soluble, and p.Arg403Trp disrupted QARS-RARS (arginyl-tRNA synthetase 1) interaction. In zebrafish, homozygous qars loss of function caused decreased brain and eye size and extensive cell death in the brain. Our results highlight the importance of QARS during brain development and that epilepsy due to impairment of QARS activity is unusually severe in comparison to other aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase disorders.\n",
      "Store-operated Ca(2+) entry is the major route of replenishment of intracellular Ca(2+) in animal cells in response to the depletion of Ca(2+) stores in the endoplasmic reticulum. It is primarily mediated by the Ca(2+)-selective release-activated Ca(2+) (CRAC) channel, which consists of the pore-forming subunits ORAI1-3 and the Ca(2+) sensors, STIM1 and STIM2. Recessive loss-of-function mutations in STIM1 or ORAI1 result in immune deficiency and nonprogressive myopathy. Heterozygous gain-of-function mutations in STIM1 cause non-syndromic myopathies as well as syndromic forms of miosis and myopathy with tubular aggregates and Stormorken syndrome; some of these syndromic forms are associated with thrombocytopenia. Increased concentration of Ca(2+) as a result of store-operated Ca(2+) entry is essential for platelet activation. The York Platelet syndrome (YPS) is characterized by thrombocytopenia, striking ultrastructural platelet abnormalities including giant electron-opaque organelles and massive, multilayered target bodies and deficiency of platelet Ca(2+) storage in delta granules. We present clinical and molecular findings in 7 YPS patients from 4 families, demonstrating that YPS patients have a chronic myopathy associated with rimmed vacuoles and heterozygous gain-of-function STIM1 mutations. These findings expand the phenotypic spectrum of STIM1-related human disorders and define the molecular basis of YPS.\n",
      "During the period January 1987-July 2003, 59 cases of perinatally detected holoprosencephaly (HPE) with cytogenetic results were identified among 97,306 deliveries at Mackay Memorial Hospital. Among these 59 cases with HPE, 25 had euploidy, 27 had numerical aneuploidy, and 7 had structural aneuploidy. In the euploid cases, the male:female sex ratio was 0.39:1, whereas in the aneuploid cases, the ratio was 1:1. The mean (+/-SD) maternal ages for numerical aneuploidy, structural aneuploidy, and euploidy were 33.0 +/- 5.1 years, 27.9 +/- 2.1 years, and 27.8 +/- 5.0 years, respectively. The frequencies of associated major structural anomalies other than craniofacial defects in the cases with numerical aneuploidy, structural aneuploidy, and euploidy were 85.7%, 0%, and 16%, respectively. The present study of HPE suggests that a female excess appears only in the euploid cases, and advanced maternal age and structural anomalies are more commonly associated with the numerically aneuploid cases than the structurally aneuploid and euploid cases.\n",
      "SASH1 (SAM and SH3 domain-containing protein 1) is a tumor suppressor gene involved in the tumorigenesis of a spectrum of solid cancers. Heterozygous SASH1 variants are known to cause autosomal-dominant dyschromatosis. Homozygosity mapping and whole-exome sequencing were performed in a consanguineous Moroccan family with two affected siblings presenting an unclassified phenotype associating an abnormal pigmentation pattern (hypo- and hyperpigmented macules of the trunk and face and areas of reticular hypo- and hyperpigmentation of the extremities), alopecia, palmoplantar keratoderma, ungueal dystrophy and recurrent spinocellular carcinoma. We identified a homozygous variant in SASH1 (c.1849G>A; p.Glu617Lys) in both affected individuals. Wound-healing assay showed that the patient's fibroblasts were better able than control fibroblasts to migrate. Following the identification of SASH1 heterozygous variants in dyschromatosis, we used reverse phenotyping to show that autosomal-recessive variants of this gene could be responsible for an overlapping but more complex phenotype that affected skin appendages. SASH1 should be added to the list of genes responsible for autosomal-dominant and -recessive genodermatosis, with no phenotype in heterozygous patients in the recessive form, and to the list of genes responsible for a predisposition to skin cancer.\n",
      "We report a three-generation family manifesting a previously undescribed X-linked mental retardation syndrome. Four of the six moderately retarded males have had episodes of manic-depressive psychosis. The phenotype also includes pyramidal signs, Parkinsonian features, and macroorchidism, but there are no characteristic dysmorphic facial features. Affected males do not show fragile sites at distal Xq on cytogenetic analysis, nor do they have expansions of the CGG repeats at the FRAXA, FRAXE, or FRAXF loci. Linkage analyses were undertaken, and a maximal LOD score of 3.311 at theta = .0 was observed with the microsatellite marker DXS1123 in Xq28. A recombination was detected in one of the affected males with DXS1691 (Xq28), which gives the proximal boundary of the localization. No distal recombination has been detected at any of the loci tested.\n",
      "The constellation of clinico-pathological and laboratory findings including massive hepatomegaly, steatosis, and marked hypertriglyceridemia in infancy is extremely rare. We describe a child who is presented with the above findings, and despite extensive diagnostic testing no cause could be identified. Whole exome sequencing was performed on the patient and parents' DNA. Mutations in GPD1 encoding glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase that catalyzes the reversible redox reaction of dihydroxyacetone phosphate and NADH to glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) and NAD(+) were identified. The proband inherited a GPD1 deletion from the father determined using copy number analysis and a missense change p.(R229Q) from the mother. GPD1 protein was absent in the patient's liver biopsy on western blot. Low normal activity of carnitine palmitoyl transferases, CPT1 and CPT2, was present in the patient's skin fibroblasts, without mutations in genes encoding for these proteins. This is the first report of compound heterozygous mutations in GPD1 associated with a lack of GPD1 protein and reduction in CPT1 and CPT2 activity.\n",
      "Ameloblastic carcinoma is a rare, odontogenic, malignant tumor that has features of ameloblastoma in addition to cytologic atypia with or without metastasis. It is classified as primary type; secondary type, intraosseous; and secondary type, peripheral according to the World Health Organization classification of 2005. Ameloblastic carcinoma, secondary type, is extremely rare, and few cases have been reported in the English-language literature. The authors report a case of ameloblastic carcinoma, secondary type, arising at the mandible in a 17-year-old Japanese boy.\n",
      "Iron-sulfur cluster assembly 1 (ISCA1) is one of the essential proteins operating in the mitochondrial iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster biogenesis pathway. We reported the variant c.259G‚Äâ>‚ÄâA [p.(Glu87Lys)] in homozygous state in exon 4 of the ISCA1 gene as the likely cause of multiple mitochondrial dysfunction syndrome 5 in a previous publication. We now report the third patient with the same phenotype and variant, further supporting the possibility of a founder event. Our observation confirms the clinical presentation associated with a probable founder variant in this condition.\n",
      "Cerebral, ocular, dental, auricular, skeletal syndrome (CODAS, OMIM 600373) is a very rare congenital malformation syndrome. This clinical entity is highly distinctive and associates mental retardation, cataract, enamel abnormalities, malformations of the helix, epiphyseal and vertebral malformations, and characteristic dysmorphic features. Since 1991, only three affected children have been reported. The etiology and pattern of inheritance of CODAS syndrome still remain unknown. We describe a new sporadic case presenting with all the characteristic features of CODAS syndrome associated with previously unreported malformations of the heart, larynx, and liver. All investigations such as karyotype, metabolic screening and array CGH were normal.\n",
      "Two siblings with Ramon syndrome (MIM 266270) were found at follow-up to have anterior and posterior segment ocular abnormalities, including Axenfeld anomaly, retinopathy, and pale anomalous optic discs. These features were not described in the original report on this family. A recent report of another family with Ramon syndrome describes pigmentary retinopathy and optic disc pallor. It may be concluded that ocular abnormalities are another feature of this syndrome with anterior chamber abnormalities present at birth and retinopathy developing later.\n",
      "A novel G8363A mutation in the mtDNA tRNA(Lys) gene was associated, in two unrelated families, with a syndrome consisting of encephalomyopathy, sensorineural hearing loss, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Muscle biopsies from the probands showed mitochondrial proliferation and partial defects of complexes I, III, and IV of the electron-transport chain. The G8363A mutation was very abundant (>95%) in muscle samples from the probands and was less copious in blood from 18 maternal relatives (mean 81.3% +/- 8.5%). Single-muscle-fiber analysis showed significantly higher levels of mutant genomes in cytochrome (c) oxidase-negative fibers than in cytochrome (c) oxidase-positive fibers. The mutation was not found in >200 individuals, including normal controls and patients with other mitochondrial encephalomyopathies, thus fulfilling accepted criteria for pathogenicity.\n",
      "Desmosterolosis is a rare multiple congenital anomaly syndrome caused by a defect in the enzyme 3-beta-hydroxysterol delta-24-reductase (DHCR24) in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. Defects in this enzyme cause increased level of the cholesterol precursor desmosterol while disrupting development of cholesterol, impacting embryogenesis. A total of 9 cases of desmosterolosis have been reported to date. We report a 20-month-old male from consanguineous parents with multiple congenital anomalies including corpus callosum hypoplasia, facial dysmorphism, cleft palate, pectus deformity, short and wide neck and distal contractures. On analysis of the regions of homozygosity found by microarray, we identified DHCR24 as a candidate gene. Sterol quantitation showed a desmosterol level of 162¬†Œºg/mL (nl: 0.82¬†¬±¬†0.48). Genetic testing confirmed the diagnosis with a homozygous likely pathogenic mutation (p.Glu191Lys) in the DHCR24 gene. Our case expands the known diagnostic spectrum for Desmosterolosis. We suggest considering Desmosterolosis in the differential diagnosis of patients who present with concurrent agenesis of the corpus callosum with white matter atrophy and ventriculomegaly, retromicrognathia with or without cleft palate, hand contractures, and delay of growth and development. Children of consanguineous mattings may be at higher risk for rare recessive disorders and testing for cholesterol synthesis defect should be a consideration for affected children. Initial evaluation can be performed using sterol quantitation, followed by genetic testing.\n",
      "We present six patients from five unrelated families with a condition originally described by Van Maldergem et al and provide follow-up studies of the original patient. The phenotype comprises a distinctive facial appearance that includes blepharophimosis, maxillary hypoplasia, telecanthus, microtia and atresia of the external auditory meatus, intellectual disability, digital contractures and skeletal anomalies together with subependymal and subcortical neuronal heterotopia. Affected patients typically have neonatal hypotonia, chronic feeding difficulties and respiratory problems. In our cohort, we have observed one instance of sibling recurrence and parental consanguinity in three of the families, indicating that autosomal recessive inheritance is likely.\n",
      "Maintaining genomic integrity is critical to avoid life-threatening disorders, such as premature aging, neurodegeneration and cancer. A multiprotein cascade operates at sites of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) to recognize, signal and repair damage. RNF168 (ring-finger nuclear factor) contributes to this emerging pathway of several E3 ubiquitin ligases that perform sequential ubiquitylations on damaged chromosomes, chromatin modifications essential for aggregation of repair complexes at the DSB sites. Here, we report the clinical and cellular phenotypes associated with a newly identified homozygous nonsense mutation in the RNF168 gene of a patient with a syndrome mimicking ataxia-telangiectasia. The mutation eliminated both of RNF168's ubiquitin-binding motifs, thus blocking progression of the ubiquitylation cascade and retention of repair proteins including tumor suppressors 53BP1 and BRCA1 at DSB sites, consistent with the observed defective DNA damage checkpoints/repair and pronounced radiosensitivity. Rapid screening for RNF168 pathway deficiency was achieved by scoring patients' lymphoblastoid cells for irradiation-induced nuclear foci containing 53BP1, a robust assay we propose for future diagnostic applications. The formation of radiation-induced DSB repair foci was rescued by ectopic expression of wild-type RNF168 in patient's cells, further causally linking the RNF168 mutation with the pathology. Clinically, this novel syndrome featured ataxia, telangiectasia, elevated alphafetoprotein, immunodeficiency, microcephaly and pulmonary failure and has implications for the differential diagnosis of autosomal recessive ataxias.\n",
      "Transport of activated nucleotide-sugars into the Golgi is critical for proper glycosylation and mutations in these transporters cause a group of rare genetic disorders termed congenital disorders of glycosylation. We performed exome sequencing on an individual with a profound neurological presentation and identified rare compound heterozygous mutations, p.Thr156Arg and p.Glu196Lys, in the CMP-sialic acid transporter, SLC35A1. Patient primary fibroblasts and serum showed a considerable decrease in the amount of N- and O-glycans terminating in sialic acid. Direct measurement of CMP-sialic acid transport into the Golgi showed a substantial decrease in overall rate of transport. Here we report the identification of the third patient with CMP-sialic acid transporter deficiency, who presented with severe neurological phenotype, but without hematological abnormalities.\n",
      "Penttinen syndrome is a distinctive disorder characterized by a prematurely aged appearance with lipoatrophy, epidermal and dermal atrophy along with hypertrophic lesions that resemble scars, thin hair, proptosis, underdeveloped cheekbones, and marked acro-osteolysis. All individuals have been simplex cases. Exome sequencing of an affected individual identified a de novo c.1994T>C p.Val665Ala variant in PDGFRB, which encodes the platelet-derived growth factor receptor Œ≤. Three additional unrelated individuals with this condition were shown to have the identical variant in PDGFRB. Distinct mutations in PDGFRB have been shown to cause infantile myofibromatosis, idiopathic basal ganglia calcification, and an overgrowth disorder with dysmorphic facies and psychosis, none of which overlaps with the clinical findings in Penttinen syndrome. We evaluated the functional consequence of this causative variant on the PDGFRB signaling pathway by transfecting mutant and wild-type cDNA into HeLa cells, and transfection showed ligand-independent constitutive signaling through STAT3 and PLCŒ≥. Penttinen syndrome is a clinically distinct genetic condition caused by a PDGFRB gain-of-function mutation that is associated with a specific and unusual perturbation of receptor function.\n",
      "We report on two sisters who show a similar pattern of anomalies consisting of bilateral Stilling-T√ºrk-Duane retraction syndrome (type 3), non-progressive hypotonia with delayed motor milestones but normal intelligence, severe, early onset scoliosis, and short stature. Muscular biopsy revealed numerous regenerating fibers, but no specific abnormalities among the non-regenerating fibers. This combination of anomalies has not been previously reported, and could represent a new autosomal recessive syndrome. The only differential diagnosis is Crisfield-Dretakis-Sharpe syndrome, a combination of lateral gaze palsy, ptosis, and scoliosis without hypotonia, recessively inherited.\n",
      "Acro-Dermato-Ungual-Lacrimal-Tooth (ADULT) syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant syndrome characterized by ectrodactyly or syndactyly, excessive freckling and dry skin, dysplastic nails, lacrimal duct atresia, primary hypodontia and early loss of permanent teeth. ADULT syndrome is one of five such syndromes that result from mutations in TP63, encoding the transcription factor p63. Until now, only four families and three individuals with ADULT syndrome have been reported in the English literature. We present a 14-year-old female patient with ADULT syndrome and discuss phenotype-genotype correlations in the p63 syndromes.\n",
      "In patients with genetically heterogeneous disorders such as intellectual disability or epilepsy, exome sequencing is a powerful tool to elucidate the underlying genetic cause. Homozygous and compound heterozygous mutations in C12orf57 have recently been described to cause an autosomal recessive syndromic form of intellectual disability, including agenesis/hypoplasia of the corpus callosum, optic coloboma, and intractable seizures. Here, we report on two siblings from nonconsanguineous parents harboring two compound heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in C12orf57 identified by exome sequencing, including a novel nonsense mutation, and review the patients described in the literature.\n",
      "Inflammasome complexes function as key innate immune effectors that trigger inflammation in response to pathogen- and danger-associated signals. Here, we report that germline mutations in the inflammasome sensor NLRP1 cause two overlapping skin disorders: multiple self-healing palmoplantar carcinoma (MSPC) and familial keratosis lichenoides chronica (FKLC). We find that NLRP1 is the most prominent inflammasome sensor in human skin, and all pathogenic NLRP1 mutations are gain-of-function alleles that¬†predispose to inflammasome activation. Mechanistically, NLRP1 mutations lead to increased self-oligomerization by disrupting the PYD and LRR domains, which are essential in maintaining NLRP1 as an inactive monomer. Primary keratinocytes from patients experience spontaneous inflammasome activation and paracrine IL-1 signaling, which is sufficient to cause skin inflammation and epidermal hyperplasia. Our findings establish a group of non-fever inflammasome disorders, uncover an unexpected auto-inhibitory function for the pyrin domain, and provide the first genetic evidence linking NLRP1 to¬†skin inflammatory syndromes and skin cancer predisposition.\n",
      "Three children are reported, a male and female sib pair of Sikh origin and a male child who was the offspring of first cousin Pakistani Muslims, with Hirschsprung's disease, hypoplastic nails, and similar minor dysmorphic features. We consider that they represent a distinct autosomal recessive syndrome.\n",
      "Elastoderma is a rare cutaneous condition, which clinically presents as an acquired laxity and decreased recoil of skin. It is histologically characterized by an increase of pleomorphic and fragmented elastic fibers in the superficial dermis. A case of a 61-year-old woman with wrinkled lax skin on the anterior and lateral aspects of her neck was reported. Microscopic examination revealed an accumulation of fragmented curled elastic fibers in the dermis. This is the fifth reported case of elastoderma.\n",
      "Mitochondrial disease is often suspected in cases of severe epileptic encephalopathy especially when a complex movement disorder, liver involvement and progressive developmental regression are present. Although mutations in either mitochondrial DNA or POLG are often present, other nuclear defects in mitochondrial DNA replication and protein translation have been associated with a severe epileptic encephalopathy.We identified a proband with an epileptic encephalopathy, complex movement disorder and a combined mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme deficiency. The child presented with neurological regression, complex movement disorder and intractable seizures. A combined deficiency of mitochondrial complexes I, III and IV was noted in liver tissue, along with increased mitochondrial DNA content in skeletal muscle. Incomplete assembly of complex V, using blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic analysis and complex I, using western blotting, suggested a disorder of mitochondrial transcription or translation. Exome sequencing identified compound heterozygous mutations in CARS2, a mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase. Both mutations affect highly conserved amino acids located within the functional ligase domain of the cysteinyl-tRNA synthase. A specific decrease in the amount of charged mt-tRNA(Cys) was detected in patient fibroblasts compared with controls. Retroviral transfection of the wild-type CARS2 into patient skin fibroblasts led to the correction of the incomplete assembly of complex V, providing functional evidence for the role of CARS2 mutations in disease aetiology.Our findings indicate that mutations in CARS2 result in a mitochondrial translational defect as seen in individuals with mitochondrial epileptic encephalopathy.\n",
      "We report on tetramelic monodactyly with autosomal dominant inheritance. The propositus and all affected relatives had only digital malformations as determined by physical examination or history. Since it could not be determined that the involved digits of the propositus or relatives were fifth fingers and toes, we conclude this to be the first report of this type of hand and foot malformation with autosomal dominant inheritance.\n",
      "Vitamin A deficiency is the leading cause of preventable blindness in children worldwide and results in a well-recognized ocular phenotype. Herein we describe a patient presenting to the eye clinic with a retinal dystrophy and ocular colobomata. This combination of clinical signs and consanguineous pedigree structure suggested a genetic basis for the disease, a hypothesis that was tested using whole genome sequencing. Bi-allelic mutations in RBP4 were identified (c.248+1G>A), consistent with a diagnosis of inherited vitamin A deficiency. We describe a constellation of signs that appear to be characteristic for this disease, increasing clinical awareness of this rare condition.\n",
      "Fleck dystrophy of the cornea is characterized by numerous, tiny, small opacities scattered throughout the entire corneal stroma. The mode of inheritance is autosomal dominant, and this dystrophy is considered to be bilaterally symmetric. This report describes five members from three-generations of the same family with corneal fleck dystrophy. Their clinical features and genetic inheritance pattern are discussed. Visual acuity in all patients was normal and the density of opacities were similar except for two patients with less density. Except for one who presented with mild photophobia all patients were asymptomatic. The inheritance pattern appeared as autosomal dominant with variable expression.\n",
      "The limb girdle muscular dystrophies are a heterogeneous group of conditions characterized by proximal muscle weakness and disease onset ranging from infancy to adulthood. We report here eight patients from seven unrelated families affected by a novel and relatively mild form of autosomal recessive limb girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD2) with onset in the first decade of life and characterized by severe mental retardation but normal brain imaging. Immunocytochemical studies revealed a significant selective reduction of alpha-dystroglycan expression in the muscle biopsies. Linkage analysis excluded known loci for both limb girdle muscular dystrophy and congenital muscular dystrophies in the consanguineous families. We consider that this represents a novel form of muscular dystrophy with associated brain involvement. The biochemical studies suggest that it may belong to the growing number of muscular dystrophies with abnormal expression of alpha-dystroglycan.\n",
      "A 4 9/12-year-old boy with achalasia microcephaly syndrome (AMS), born to a consanguineous couple, is reported. Comparative analysis of this case and the patients previously described in a Mexican family supports the notion that the syndrome is a distinct autosomal recessive condition. It is interesting that the area of origin and ethnicity of both the present and the previously reported cases is northwest Mexico.\n",
      "Array comparative genomic hybridization is now a powerful tool to investigate patients with multiple congenital abnormalities and intellectual/motor impairment, and genomic imbalances are identified in a growing number of children with intellectual disability. Deletions in the 17p13.1 region have been reported in patients with dysmorphic features and developmental delay but a consistent phenotype has yet to emerge. Here, we report on the diagnosis of a 17p13.1 microdeletion of 829 kb in an 8-year-old girl presenting with profound cognitive disability, psychomotor delay, facial dysmorphisms, and refractory epilepsy. This deletion comprises 44 genes, including 8 OMIM morbid genes. We discuss genetic, clinical, and epileptic features comparing our patient with those previously reported in the literature.\n",
      "The observation of two new cases in a previously reported family has brought about a change in the delineation of the syndrome initially defined. To the abnormalities already described (branchial dysplasia, mental deficiency, club feet, inguinal herniae) must be added a paucity of interlobular bile duts; the relationship between this new syndrome and the Alagille syndrome requires reconsideration.\n",
      "DNA methylation plays a critical role in both embryonic development and tumorigenesis and is mediated through various DNA methyltransferases. Constitutional mutations in the de novo DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A cause a recently identified Tatton-Brown-Rahman overgrowth syndrome (TBRS). Somatically acquired mutations in DNMT3A are causally associated with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and p.Arg882His represents the most prevalent hotspot. So far, no patients with TBRS have been reported to have subsequently developed AML. Here, we report a live birth and the survival of a female with the TBRS phenotype who had a heterozygous constitutional DNMT3A mutation at the AML somatic mutation hotspot p.Arg882His in her DNA from peripheral blood and buccal tissue. Her characteristic features at birth included hypotonia, narrow palpebral fissures, ventricular septal defect, umbilical hernia, sacral cyst, Chiari type I anomaly. At the age of 6 years, she exhibited overgrowth (>‚Äâ3 SD) and round face and intellectual disability. This report represents the first documentation of the same variant (DNMT3A p.Arg882His) as both the constitutional mutation associated with TBRS and the somatic mutation hotspot of AML. The observation neither confirms nor denies the notion that mutations responsible for TBRS and those for AML might share the same mode of action. Larger data sets are required to determine whether TBRS patients with constitutional DNMT3A mutations are at an increased risk for AML. ¬© 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\n",
      "A fetus with de novo ring chromosome 16 is presented. At 20 weeks' gestation, ultrasound examination demonstrated bilateral clubfoot, bilateral renal pyelectasis, hypoplasia of the corpus callosum, and transposition of the great vessel. Amniocentesis was performed. Chromosome analysis identified a ring chromosome 16 [47,XY,r(16)] and array comparative genomic hybridization (a-CGH) demonstrated that the ring included the euchromatic portion 16p11.2. Postmortem examination confirmed prenatal findings. This is the first case of de novo ring chromosome 16 diagnosed prenatally with a new phenotypic pattern and also reinforces the importance of offering amniocentesis with a-CGH if fetal anomalies are detected.\n",
      "KBG syndrome is a rare, autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations or deletions leading to haploinsufficiency for the Ankrin Repeating Domain-Containing protein 11 (ANKRD11) at chromosome 16q24.3. Kabuki syndrome is caused by mutations or deletions of lysine (K)-specific methyltransferase 2D (KMT2D) and lysine-specific methylase 6A (KDM6A). We report on a male with developmental delays, cleft palate, craniofacial dysmorphism, hypotonia, and central nervous system anomalies including diminished white matter with thinning of the corpus callosum. Exome sequencing revealed a de novo mutation in ANKRD11, c.2606_2608delAGA, predicting p.Lys869del and an additional, de novo mutation, c.2353T>C, predicting p.Tyr785His in KDM1A, a gene not previously associated with a human phenotype. We describe this child as the first report of a deleterious sequence variant in KDM1A and hypothesize that his phenotype resulted from the combined effect of both mutations.\n",
      "We report on two brothers with mental deficiency, short stature of prenatal onset, microcephaly, alopecia/sparse hair, follicular ichthyosis, multiple skeletal anomalies, and recurrent respiratory infections. The younger brother has celiac disease, cryptorchidism, inguinal herniae, and hypohidrosis, while the older brother has hidrotic ectodermal dysplasia, juvenile autoimmune thyroiditis, hypolacrimation, photophobia, and optic atrophy. Striking resemblance exists between our patients and those previously reported by Schinzel ¬ø1980: Helv Paediatr Acta 35:243-251 and van Gelderen ¬ø1982: Am J Med Genet 13:383-387. The fact that boys are born to young and healthy nonconsanguineous parents and there are no other affected relatives suggests autosomal or X-linked recessive inheritance or parental germinal mosaicism for a dominant mutation.\n",
      "Siblings of non-consanguineous Jewish-Ethiopian ancestry presented with congenital axial hypotonia, weakness of the abducens nerve, psychomotor developmental delay with brain ventriculomegaly, variable thinning of corpus callosum and cardiac septal defects. Homozygosity mapping identified a single disease-associated locus of 3.5 Mb on chromosome 3. Studies of a Bedouin consanguineous kindred affected with a similar recessive phenotype identified a single disease-associated 18 Mb homozygosity locus encompassing the entire 3.5 Mb locus. Whole exome sequencing demonstrated only two homozygous mutations within a shared identical haplotype of 0.6 Mb, common to both Bedouin and Ethiopian affected individuals, suggesting an ancient common founder. Only one of the mutations segregated as expected in both kindreds and was not found in Bedouin and Jewish-Ethiopian controls: c.1404A>G, p.[*468Trpext*6] in CCDC174. We showed that CCDC174 is ubiquitous, restricted to the cell nucleus and co-localized with EIF4A3. In fact, yeast-two-hybrid assay demonstrated interaction of CCDC174 with EIF4A3, a component of exon junction complex. Knockdown of the CCDC174 ortholog in Xenopus laevis embryos resulted in poor neural fold closure at the neurula stage with later embryonic lethality. Knockdown embryos exhibited a sharp reduction in expression of n-tubulin, a marker for differentiating primary neurons, and of hindbrain markers krox20 and hoxb3. The Xenopus phenotype could be rescued by the human normal, yet not the mutant CCDC174 transcripts. Moreover, overexpression of mutant but not normal CCDC174 in neuroblastoma cells caused rapid apoptosis. In line with the hypotonia phenotype, the CCDC174 mutation caused depletion of RYR1 and marked myopathic changes in skeletal muscle of affected individuals.\n",
      "Autosomal dominant inheritance of a type of peripheral dysostosis occurred in a family with diaphyseal aclasis. The features of their type of peripheral dysostosis were short limbed short stature, normal intelligence, very stubby fingers, flat face and nose, shortened metacarpals and terminal phalanges, thickened beaten-copper skull vault, and advanced skeletal maturation.\n",
      "Four sibs, three males and one female, had microcephaly, hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, short stature, and multiple congenital anomalies. They had five normal sibs and consanguineous parents. Findings in the affected sibs also included a narrow forehead, synophrys, micrognathia, abnormally folded pinnae, early loss of teeth in three, cubitus valgus in two, genu valgum, gynecomastia, and undescended testes in one. All sibs had normal chromosomes. Results of tests for growth hormone release and adrenocortical function were normal. Luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) stimulation tests were consistent with primary gonadal failure. Testicular biopsy, performed on two affected males, was normal in one and showed focal atrophy with decreased spermatogenesis in the other. The patients manifest a phenotype different from all other known types of hypergonadotropic hypogonadism and appear to represent a new MCA/MR syndrome.\n",
      "Stiff skin syndrome (SSS) is a noninflammatory, fibrosing condition of the skin, often affecting the limb girdles.We present 4 new patients with SSS with largely unilateral, segmental distribution. To date, reported cases of SSS have been grouped based on generally accepted clinical and histopathologic findings. The purpose of this study was to analyze differences in clinical and histopathologic findings between previously reported SSS cases.This is a retrospective review of 4 new cases and 48 previously published cases of SSS obtained from PubMed search.Of 52 total cases, 18 (35%) were segmentally distributed and 34 (65%) were widespread. The average age of onset was 4.1¬†years versus 1.6¬†years for segmental versus widespread SSS, respectively. Limitation in joint mobility affected 44% of patients with segmental SSS and 97% of patients with widespread SSS. Histopathologic findings were common between the 2 groups.This was a retrospective study of previously published cases limited by the completeness and accuracy of the reviewed cases.We propose a distinct clinical entity, segmental SSS, characterized by a segmental distribution, later age of onset, and less severe functional limitation. Both segmental SSS and widespread SSS share common diagnostic histopathologic features.\n",
      "To report a novel cell surface autoantigen of encephalitis that is a critical regulatory subunit of the Kv4.2 potassium channels.Four patients with encephalitis of unclear etiology and antibodies with a similar pattern of neuropil brain immunostaining were selected for autoantigen characterization. Techniques included immunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry, cell-base experiments with Kv4.2 and several dipeptidyl-peptidase-like protein-6 (DPPX) plasmid constructs, and comparative brain immunostaining of wild-type and DPPX-null mice.Immunoprecipitation studies identified DPPX as the target autoantigen. A cell-based assay confirmed that all 4 patients, but not 210 controls, had DPPX antibodies. Symptoms included agitation, confusion, myoclonus, tremor, and seizures (1 case with prominent startle response). All patients had pleocytosis, and 3 had severe prodromal diarrhea of unknown etiology. Given that DPPX tunes up the Kv4.2 potassium channels (involved in somatodendritic signal integration and attenuation of dendritic back-propagation of action potentials), we determined the epitope distribution in DPPX, DPP10 (a protein homologous to DPPX), and Kv4.2. Patients' antibodies were found to be specific for DPPX, without reacting with DPP10 or Kv4.2. The unexplained diarrhea led to a demonstration of a robust expression of DPPX in the myenteric plexus, which strongly reacted with patients' antibodies. The course of neuropsychiatric symptoms was prolonged and often associated with relapses during decreasing immunotherapy. Long-term follow-up showed substantial improvement in 3 patients (1 was lost to follow-up).Antibodies to DPPX are associated with a protracted encephalitis characterized by central nervous system hyperexcitability (agitation, myoclonus, tremor, seizures), pleocytosis, and frequent diarrhea at symptom onset. The disorder is potentially treatable with immunotherapy.\n",
      "Here we report on a Portuguese family with three sisters who shared moderate intellectual disability, unusual facial morphology (short palpebral fissures; broad nasal tip; thin upper and lower vermillion; broad and pointed chin) and hand anomalies in two of them (short left third and fifth right metacarpals in one case; marked syndactyly between the third and fourth fingers in another). One of the sisters had microcephaly and short stature, and the other two were obese. Obesity and somewhat similar facial features were also present in the otherwise healthy mother. Despite the overlap with several known syndromes (Albright osteodystrophy; Filippi syndrome; Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome; microdeletion 2q37), we suggest this condition is previously unreported, and most likely displays an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. ¬© 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\n",
      "The genetic cause of GAPO syndrome, a condition characterized by growth retardation, alopecia, pseudoanodontia, and progressive visual impairment, has not previously been identified. We studied four ethnically unrelated affected individuals and identified homozygous nonsense mutations (c.262C>T [p.Arg88*] and c.505C>T [p.Arg169*]) or splicing mutations (c.1435-12A>G [p.Gly479Phefs*119]) in ANTXR1, which encodes anthrax toxin receptor 1. The nonsense mutations predictably trigger nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, resulting in the loss of ANTXR1. The transcript with the splicing mutation theoretically encodes a truncated ANTXR1 containing a neopeptide composed of 118 unique amino acids in its C terminus. GAPO syndrome's major phenotypic features, which include dental abnormalities and the accumulation of extracellular matrix, recapitulate those found in Antxr1-mutant mice and point toward an underlying defect in extracellular-matrix regulation. Thus, we propose that mutations affecting ANTXR1 function are responsible for this disease's characteristic generalized defect in extracellular-matrix homeostasis.\n",
      "We describe a novel clinical phenotype associating T- and B-cell lymphopenia, intermittent neutropenia, and atrial septal defects in 3 members of a consanguineous kindred. Their clinical histories included recurrent bacterial infections, viral infections, mucocutaneous candidiasis, cutaneous warts, and skin abscesses. Homozygosity mapping and candidate gene sequencing revealed a homozygous premature termination mutation in the gene STK4 (serine threonine kinase 4, formerly having the symbol MST1). STK4 is the human ortholog of Drosophila Hippo, the central constituent of a highly conserved pathway controlling cell growth and apoptosis. STK4-deficient lymphocytes and neutrophils exhibit enhanced loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and increased susceptibility to apoptosis. STK4 deficiency is a novel human primary immunodeficiency syndrome.\n",
      "Using exome analysis, we identified a novel overgrowth syndrome arising from a mutation in PDGFRB, which plays a critical role in growth and differentiation. This entity is characterized by somatic overgrowth, distinctive facial features, hyperelastic and fragile skin, white matter lesions, and neurologic deterioration.\n",
      "A case of pancreatoblastoma (PB) in a 2 month-old male infant with incomplete Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is presented. Clinical examination disclosed left hemihypertrophy, macroglossia, bilateral exophthalmos, and enlargement of the left testis. Imaging with ultrasound and computed tomography scan showed a well-defined, heterogeneous, and grossly cystic mass arising from the head of the pancreas. Serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level was elevated. The tumor was completely resected, and the histological analysis showed PB. The patient's recovery was uneventful, and AFP returned to normal values after surgery. The child has been disease-free for 5 years, and his serum AFP remained within normal values. Six other examples of this association, PB, and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome are recorded in the literature. The risk of developing tumor in this syndrome (complete and incomplete form) increases when hemihypertrophy is present, and the need for routine screening examination is warranted. Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome was suggested to be a favorable biological marker for survival in children who have intraabdominal tumors.\n",
      "We present a syndrome manifested in two half brothers and their two maternal aunts which is characterised in the two boys by severe mental retardation and craniofacial dysmorphism (broad, coarse features and marked plagiocephaly with flattened occiput), and in the aunts merely by moderate mental retardation without dysmorphic features. The brothers do not seem to fall into any previously described X linked syndrome with mental retardation.\n",
      "Interstitial deletions of the long arm of chromosome 13 (13q) are related with variable phenotypes, according to the size and the location of the deleted region. The main clinical features are moderate/severe mental and growth retardation, cranio-facial dysmorphism, variable congenital defects and increased susceptibility to tumors. Here we report a 3-year-old girl carrying a de novo 13q13.3-21.32 interstitial deletion. She showed developmental delay, growth retardation and mild dysmorphism including curly hair, high forehead, short nose, thin upper lip and long philtrum. An abnormal mass was surgically removed from her liver resulting in a hemangioendothelioma. Array analysis allowed us to define a deleted region of about 27.87 Mb, which includes the RB1 gene. This is the first report of a 13q deletion associated with infantile hemangioendothelioma of the liver.\n",
      "Lafora disease is a rare, autosomal recessive, progressive myoclonic epilepsy with onset typically in the second decade of life and uniformly fatal outcome. Most of the current literature focuses on diagnosis, genetic basis, neurological signs, and possible treatment of this currently incurable disease. On literature review of over 50 articles including over 300 patients, there were no comments on or pathologic description of endocrinologic issues in relation to Lafora disease.We describe a patient with Lafora disease with severe neurological deterioration. During hospitalization for urosepsis, he exhibited thyrotoxicosis with a free thyroxine (T4) level greater than 7.77 ng/dL. On autopsy, he had lymphocytic thyroiditis and Lafora bodies throughout his organs including the anterior pituitary, hypothalamus, and pancreas.This is the first report of the pathologic findings of Lafora bodies in endocrine organs. Although this patient's thyrotoxic state was likely not a direct result of his Lafora disease, given the diffuse deposition of Lafora bodies, endocrinologic abnormalities should be considered in patients with Lafora disease. Furthermore, acute decompensation in these individuals may arise not from a declining neurological status but from a coincidental disease process.\n",
      "Anetoderma is a rare cutaneous disorder where a localized dermal defect of elastic fibers determines depressed areas and often herniated saclike skin. Primary anetoderma is an idiopathic phenomenon while secondary anetoderma is related to various conditions. The term primary anetoderma implies that the lesions occur in clinically normal skin although they may be associated with another dermatological or systemic disease or condition, without a well established relationship. The term secondary anetoderma implies that anetoderma occurred on the same site as another skin lesion. Familial anetoderma is a very rare condition that can be associated with bony, neurological and ocular anomalies. Recently some families with familial anetoderma have been described, where the disease seems to be limited to the skin. The pathogenesis for familial anetoderma is still unclear. It has been reported in only 10 families and in the first 4 reported families, anetoderma was always associated with extra-cutaneous abnormalities, while in the remaining 6 families, all described in last three decades, anetoderma was limited to the skin. We report here another two families with anetoderma without any associated disease and we review the literature on familial anetoderma.\n",
      "Pancreatic neoplasms producing exclusively glucagon associated with glucagon cell hyperplasia of the islets and not related to hereditary endocrine syndromes have been recently described. They represent a novel entity within the panel of non-syndromic disorders associated with hyperglucagonemia. This case report describes a 36-year-old female with a 10 years history of non-specific abdominal pain. No underlying cause was evident despite extensive diagnostic work-up. More recently she was diagnosed with gall bladder stones. Abdominal ultrasound, computerised tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed no pathologic findings apart from cholelithiasis. Endoscopic ultrasound revealed a 5.5 mm pancreatic lesion. Fine needle aspiration showed cells focally expressing chromogranin, suggestive but not diagnostic of a low grade neuroendocrine tumor. OctreoScan(¬Æ) was negative. Serum glucagon was elevated to 66 pmol/L (normal: 0-50 pmol/L). Other gut hormones, chromogranin A and chromogranin B were normal. Cholecystectomy and enucleation of the pancreatic lesion were undertaken. Postoperatively, abdominal symptoms resolved and serum glucagon dropped to 7 pmol/L. Although H and E staining confirmed normal pancreatic tissue, immunohistochemistry was initially thought to be suggestive of alpha cell hyperplasia. A count of glucagon positive cells from 5 islets, compared to 5 islets from 5 normal pancreata indicated that islet size and glucagon cell ratios were increased, however still within the wide range of normal physiological findings. Glucagon receptor gene (GCGR) sequencing revealed a heterozygous deletion, K349_G359del and 4 missense mutations. This case may potentially represent a progenitor stage of glucagon cell adenomatosis with hyperglucagonemia in the absence of glucagonoma syndrome. The identification of novel GCGR mutations suggests that these may represent the underlying cause of this condition.\n",
      "Human T-cell function is dependent on T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) and co-signalling as evidenced by immunodeficiencies affecting TCR-dependent signalling pathways. Here, we show four human patients with EBV+ disseminated smooth muscle tumours that carry two homozygous loss-of-function mutations in the CARMIL2 (RLTPR) gene encoding the capping protein regulator and myosin 1 linker 2. These patients lack regulatory T cells without evidence of organ-specific autoimmunity, and have defective CD28 co-signalling associated with impaired T-cell activation, differentiation and function, as well as perturbed cytoskeletal organization associated with T-cell polarity and migration disorders. Human CARMIL2-deficiency is therefore an autosomal recessive primary immunodeficiency disorder associated with defective CD28-mediated TCR co-signalling and impaired cytoskeletal dynamics.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To report a case of a 9-year-old child with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and Jalili syndrome, the latter denoting a rare combination of cone-rod dystrophy and amelogenesis imperfecta. METHODS: Detailed ophthalmological and electrophysiological examinations were carried out and blood samples were taken from the patient and her father for molecular genetic analysis by direct DNA sequencing of the NF1 and the ancient conserved domain protein 4 (CNNM4) gene. RESULTS: The diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) could be confirmed clinically and genetically. Furthermore, cone-rod dystrophy and amelogenesis imperfecta could be observed as typical features of a rare condition, acknowledged as Jalili syndrome. The diagnosis was assured on the basis of clinical examinations and molecular genetic analysis of the CNNM4 gene, which was previously shown to cause Jalili syndrome. CONCLUSION: Our case shows a unique combination of NF1 and Jalili syndrome. The random association of two diseases is unusual and deserves attention. This case highlights the importance not only of detailed clinical examination, but also of molecular genetic analysis, which together provide a precise diagnosis.\n",
      "The MRE11/RAD50/NBN (MRN) complex plays a key role in recognizing and signaling DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Hypomorphic mutations in NBN (previously known as NBS1) and MRE11A give rise to the autosomal-recessive diseases Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS) and ataxia-telangiectasia-like disorder (ATLD), respectively. To date, no disease due to RAD50 deficiency has been described. Here, we report on a patient previously diagnosed as probably having NBS, with microcephaly, mental retardation, 'bird-like' face, and short stature. At variance with this diagnosis, she never had severe infections, had normal immunoglobulin levels, and did not develop lymphoid malignancy up to age 23 years. We found that she is compound heterozygous for mutations in the RAD50 gene that give rise to low levels of unstable RAD50 protein. Cells from the patient were characterized by chromosomal instability; radiosensitivity; failure to form DNA damage-induced MRN foci; and impaired radiation-induced activation of and downstream signaling through the ATM protein, which is defective in the human genetic disorder ataxia-telangiectasia. These cells were also impaired in G1/S cell-cycle-checkpoint activation and displayed radioresistant DNA synthesis and G2-phase accumulation. The defective cellular phenotype was rescued by wild-type RAD50. In conclusion, we have identified and characterized a patient with a RAD50 deficiency that results in a clinical phenotype that can be classified as an NBS-like disorder (NBSLD).\n",
      "Dentin dysplasia, type II, is an inherited autosomal dominant disorder in which primary teeth are amber and translucent, with pulp chambers obliterated by abnormal dentin. The permanent teeth have a normal coronal morphologic character and coloration but exhibit \"thistle tube\"-shaped pulp chambers as well as numerous pulpal calcifications. The disorder has traditionally been thought to be somewhat rare; however, this article presents 2 new families in which several generations with the disorder were reported to the authors within a 1-year period. It also includes a review of the literature documenting a total of 17 previously reported families.\n",
      "Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is a stress-induced enzyme that catalyses the oxidation of heme to biliverdin. The primary deficiency of this enzyme has been shown in HO-1 knockout mice, and is characterized by intrauterine death and chronic inflammation. The first case of human HO-1 deficiency was reported in 1999. Human HO-1 deficiency has been observed to involve the endothelial cells more severely, resulting in hemolysis and disseminated intravascular coagulation. We report another case of human HO-1 deficiency in a young girl with congenital asplenia, who presented with severe hemolysis, inflammation, nephritis, which was refractory to therapy with corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab.\n",
      "A syndrome of congenital and permanent universal alopecia, involving absence of scalp hair, eyebrows, eyelashes, axillary and pubic hair, and the rest of the body hair is reported. Mental subnormality was noted in eight and psychomotor epilepsy in seven out of 12 affected individuals. Pyorrhea was observed in all ascertained patients. No abnormality of nails or skin (apart from absence of hair) was noted. The disorder, which affected seven females and five males from six sibships, was transmitted through four generations. Utilizing the simple sib method, a ratio of 6/12 was obtained for affected individuals. The vertical transmission of the disorder, implication of both sexes, male to male transmission, and the 1:1 (affected: unaffected) segregation ratio support autosomal dominant inheritance. Penetrance appears to be complete.\n",
      "Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) constitute a rare variety of soft tissue sarcomas thought to originate from Schwann cells or pluripotent cells of the neural crest. Malignant triton tumor (MTT), a very rare, highly aggressive soft tissue tumor, is a subgroup of MPNST and is comprised of malignant Schwann cells coexisting with malignant rhabdomyoblasts. We herein report the case of a 24-year-old man who presented a subcutaneous mass in his right thigh. The mass was removed surgically in its entirety and radiation therapy was applied locally to prevent tumor regrowth. Nonetheless, the patient died 10 months after surgery from metastases to the lung and brain. He presented neither cafe-au-lait spots nor cutaneous neurofibromas. The histopathology showed a transition from a neurofibroma to an MTT, making this the second report of an MTT arising from a neurofibroma without neurofibromatosis type 1, an autosomal dominant disorder with which 50-70% of tumors reported in previous studies were associated. A histopathological examination using immunostaining with desmin confirmed this diagnosis. MTT has a poorer prognosis than MPNST and should therefore be regarded as a distinct clinical entity.\n",
      "Larsen syndrome is a congenital condition consisting of multiple large joint dislocations associated with a distinctive facial appearance and frequently other abnormalities. The syndrome is probably genetically heterogeneous, with both dominant and recessive inheritance reported. Previously two cases have been reported where a Larsen-like syndrome was associated with unbalanced chromosomal translocations resulting in partial trisomy 1q and monosomy distal 6p. We now report a child with an unbalanced translocation resulting in a distal 6p deletion and partial trisomy 10q, who has Larsen-like features and has also severe developmental delay. A G-banded preparation revealed a karyotype 46,XX,der(6),t(6:10)(p25;q25.2) and the breakpoint at 6p25 was confirmed by FISH using YAC probes (between 6p25 at D6s477/F13A1 and 6p24 at 6WI13606). Our case provides further evidence for a Larsen-like locus at distal 6p and reduces the potential critical region.\n",
      "We found a sporadic case of mental retardation associated with short stature and constipation. We investigated the possible genetic origin of the syndrome. Clinical and biochemical investigations were conducted. Exome sequencing was used to search for pathogenic variations. A de novo mutation (c.1183G>T, p.E395X) was found in one allele of the THRA gene. The mutation creates a stop codon, which eliminates the C-terminal helix of the TRŒ±1 receptor for thyroid hormone. The patient has typical symptoms for the resistance to thyroid hormone Œ± (RTHŒ±) genetic disease, but has a normal head circumference. There are now 21 known mutations in THRA. All mutations that alter the C-terminal helix of TRŒ±1 lead to severe forms of RTHŒ±.\n",
      "We report a case of 13-year-old girl with short stature, microcephalus, blepharophimosis, ptosis, bilateral microphthalmia (more prominent in the right), hypogonadism, other minor anomalies, and severe mental retardation. Her mother had two spontaneous abortions. She was born as the second baby of dizygotic twins. The first baby died of diaphragm hernia and heart failure. Her body height, body weight and head circumference were below -3 SD. She did not have epicanthus inversus, hypoplastic teeth, heart anomalies, seizures, muscle weakness, and hearing loss. She was able to handle her wheelchair, but could neither understand nor speak meaningful words. When she looked at something in front of herself, she turned her face up and lifted the left eyelid with her own fingers. She had no somatic change of puberty. Laboratory and radiological examinations demonstrated a normal karyotype, normal bone age, findings of Chilaiditi syndrome, and absence of brain malformation on cranial CT. The serum levels of LH and FSH were high for age and those of estradiol and progesterone were low, suggesting immaturity of ovarian function. These findings suggested the ovarian functions might not get maturations. Hypogonadism has previously been reported in female cases of the blepharophimosis, ptosis and epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) type I, but not in those with the Ohdo blepharophimosis syndrome (OBS). Our case's condition differs from BPES because of the presence of mental retardation and the absence of epicanthus inversus. We also discuss the distinction from OBS, a disease entity of unknown etiology presenting with a variety of complications.\n",
      "Tel2-interacting proteins 1 and 2 (TTI1 and TTI2) physically interact with telomere maintenance 2 (TEL2) to form a conserved trimeric complex called the Triple T complex. This complex is a master regulator of phosphoinositide-3-kinase-related protein kinase (PIKKs) abundance and DNA damage response signaling. Using a combination of autozygosity mapping and high-throughput sequencing in a large consanguineous multiplex family, we found that a missense c.1307T>A/p.I436N mutation in TTI2 causes a human autosomal recessive condition characterized by severe cognitive impairment, microcephaly, behavioral troubles, short stature, skeletal anomalies, and facial dysmorphic features. Immunoblotting experiment showed decreased amount of all Triple T complex components in the patient skin fibroblasts. Consistently, a drastically reduced steady-state level of all PIKKs tested was also observed in the patient cells. Combined with previous observations, these findings emphasises the role of the TTI2 gene in the etiology of intellectual disability and further support the role of PIKK signaling in brain development and functioning.\n",
      "Severe combined immune deficiency (SCID) is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by profound defects in cellular and humoral immunity. We report here an infant with clinical and laboratory features of SCID and selective CD4 lymphopenia and lack of CD28 expression on CD8(+) T cells. T cells from this patient showed poor blastogenic responses to various mitogens and IL-2. Other T cell antigen receptor- induced responses, including upregulation of CD69, were similarly inhibited. However, more proximal T cell antigen receptor signaling events, such as anti-CD3 induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation, phosphorylation of mitogen-associated protein kinase, and calcium mobilization were intact. Although p59fyn and ZAP-70 protein tyrosine kinases were expressed at normal levels, a marked decrease in the level of p56lck was noted. Furthermore, this decrease was associated with the presence of an alternatively spliced lck transcript lacking the exon 7 kinase encoding domain. These data suggest that a deficiency in p56lck expression can produce a SCID phenotype in humans.\n",
      "X-linked mental retardation is a common disorder that accounts for 5-10% of cases of mental retardation in males. Fragile X syndrome is the most common form resulting from a loss of expression of the FMR1 gene. On the other hand, partial duplication of the long arm of the X chromosome is uncommon. It leads to functional disomy of the corresponding genes and has been reported in several cases of mental retardation in males. In this study, we report on the clinical and genetic characterization of a new X-linked mental retardation syndrome characterized by short stature, hypogonadism and facial dysmorphism, and show that this syndrome is caused by a small Xq27.3q28 interstitial duplication encompassing the FMR1 gene. This family broadens the phenotypic spectrum of FMR1 anomalies in an unexpected manner, and we suggest that this condition may represent the fragile X syndrome \"contre-type\".\n",
      "Ketamine is a popular drug of abuse in China, especially for young adults between the 18 and 30 years. It produces desirable short-term sensations of excitement, dream-like states, hallucinations, and vivid imagery, but is also responsible for untoward effects of the gastrointestinal and urinary tracts. Abusers often present with severe abdominal pain and dysuria. In addition to its excretion in urine, ketamine is also excreted in bile and can lead to biliary dilatation. Sixteen reports of this phenomenon have been described in the literature, mostly in China. To date, this phenomenon has not been described in the United States. We present 2 cases of ketamine-induced biliary dilatation in young adult Asian patients. It is a new entity in the United States but should be recognized early, as it may prevent unnecessary investigation with blood work, imaging, therapeutic endoscopy, or even surgery.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: The Ritscher-Schinzel syndrome (RSS), also known as the 3C syndrome, is an autosomal recessive disorder classically comprising craniofacial, cerebellar and cardiac defects. The underlying molecular etiology remains unknown; therefore, prenatal diagnosis of recurrences depends on identification of the associated structural anomalies on second trimester ultrasound examination. Identification of recurrences using first-trimester ultrasound has not been reported previously. METHODS: Two women who presented at our center with fetal nuchal abnormalities on first trimester ultrasound went on to have children with RSS. One of the women had also undergone a previous pregnancy termination for fetal anomalies consistent with RSS. The ultrasound findings and details of these 3 cases were reviewed. RESULTS: Both cases of RSS and the third suspected case were found to have nuchal abnormalities on first-trimester scan. All went on to develop malformations consistent with RSS detectable on second-trimester ultrasound. The later 2 cases continued to term and the children had facial characteristics consistent with RSS. CONCLUSION: First-trimester ultrasound assessment of nuchal translucency could be considered as a method for identifying sib recurrences of RSS. In addition, RSS should be on the differential diagnosis when increased nuchal translucency is seen on first-trimester scan.\n",
      "Meigs'syndrome is defined as a hydrothorax with ascites and benign ovarian tumor, both of which resolve on removal of the tumor. Pseudo-Meigs'syndrome or atypical Meigs'syndrome occurs when a pelvic mass other than an ovarian fibroma is present with hydrothorax and ascites. Both these syndromes should be nevertheless considered in women who present hydrothorax and ascites. This case concerns a 50-year-old woman who presented a pseudo-Meigs'syndrome (Hydrothorax and uterine leiomyoma). The distinction between these two syndrome is useless, because tumour removal is the only treatment.\n",
      "A 32 year-old asymptomatic male came to our attention with a 21-year history, documented elsewhere, of puzzling increases in his serum transaminase level. At first, very low serum ceruloplasmin level suggested Wilson disease. Two liver biopsies showed mild portal inflammation, steatosis and mild fibrosis. Further investigation revealed low levels of the glycoproteins AT III and clotting factor XI, leading to a diagnosis of congenital disorder of glycosylation (CDG) type II. Further studies as to the cause of this 'apparently new' CDG, are ongoing. On the basis of our data and a literature review, we suggest that subjects with asymptomatic hypertransaminasaemia be screened for CDG.\n",
      "We report on four unrelated children with delayed speech development associated with mild facial asymmetry and transverse ear lobe creases. The combination of these features proved to be familial in one case. Our findings seem to confirm the existence of a syndrome described by Mehes [(1993) J Med Genet 30:76-77].\n",
      "Amyloidosis cutis dyschromia is a rare form of primary cutaneous amyloidosis. Amyloid deposition in the skin occurs without systemic manifestations and produces hypopigmented and hyperpigmented macules. A 19-year-old woman is presented with progression of this condition over 16 years.\n",
      "The cardinal features of Primrose syndrome (MIM 259050) are dysmorphic facial features, macrocephaly, and intellectual disability, as well as large body size, height and weight, and calcified pinnae. A variety of neurological signs and symptoms have been reported including hearing loss, autism, behavioral abormalities, hypotonia, cerebral calcifications, and hypoplasia of the corpus callosum. Recently, heterozygous de novo missense mutations in ZBTB20, coding for a zing finger protein, have been identified in Primrose syndrome patients. We report a boy with intellectual disability carrying two de novo missense mutations in the last exon of ZBTB20 (Ser616Phe and Gly741Arg; both previously unreported). One of them, Ser616Phe, affects an amino acid located in one of the C2H2 zing-fingers involved in DNA-binding and close to other missense mutations already described. Reverse phenotyping showed that this patient presents with classic features of Primrose syndrome (dysmorphic facies, macrocephaly, hearing loss, hypotonia, hypoplasia of the corpus callosum) and, in addition, congenital hypothyroidism. Review of the literature reveals another Primrose syndrome patient with hypothyroidism and thus, this may represent an under recognized component that should be investigated in other patients. ¬© 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\n",
      "Constitutional DICER1 mutations have been associated with pleuropulmonary blastoma, cystic nephroma, Sertoli-Leydig tumours and multinodular goitres, while somatic DICER1 mutations have been reported in additional tumour types. Here we report a novel syndrome termed GLOW, an acronym for its core phenotypic findings, which include Global developmental delay, Lung cysts, Overgrowth and Wilms tumour caused by mutations in the RNase IIIb domain of DICER1.We performed whole exome sequencing on peripheral mononuclear blood cells of an affected proband and identified a de novo missense mutation in the RNase IIIb domain of DICER1. We confirmed an additional de novo missense mutation in the same domain of an unrelated case by Sanger sequencing. These missense mutations in the RNase IIIb domain of DICER1 are suspected to affect one of four metal binding sites located within this domain. Pyrosequencing was used to determine the relative abundance of mutant alleles in various tissue types. The relative mutation abundance is highest in Wilms tumour and unaffected kidney samples when compared with blood, confirming that the mutation is mosaic. Finally, we performed bioinformatic analysis of microRNAs expressed in murine cells carrying specific Dicer1 RNase IIIb domain metal binding site-associated mutations. We have identified a subset of 3p microRNAs that are overexpressed whose target genes are over-represented in mTOR, MAPK and TGF-√é¬≤ signalling pathways.We propose that mutations affecting the metal binding sites of the DICER1 RNase IIIb domain alter the balance of 3p and 5p microRNAs leading to deregulation of these growth signalling pathways, causing a novel human overgrowth syndrome.\n",
      "A family is presented in which five individuals in four generations have shown variable expression of distal symphalangism in hands and feet. The mode of inheritance is autosomal dominant. Two individuals show involvement of the thumbs and halluces; this has not been noted previously in true distal symphalangism.\n",
      "STEAP3/TSAP6 encodes a ferrireductase that is involved in the acquisition of iron by developing erythroblasts and steap3/tsap6 null-mice display severe microcytic anemia. We report a family in which 3 siblings born to healthy parents display transfusion-dependent hypochromic anemia. A nonsense STEAP3/TSAP6 was identified in the siblings at the heterozygous state. This mutation was inherited from their father while no mutation was found in their mother. A large variability of expression was found between normal alleles in a control population, confirming a previous report that STEAP3/TSAPS6 is an expressed quantitative trait locus (e-QTL). Determination of the relative allele expression showed that the \"normal\" allele was expressed at a significantly higher level in the father than in the affected siblings relative to the shared mutated allele. The blood level of STEAP3/TSAP6 mRNA was severely reduced in the siblings, while both parents were in the lower range of normal controls. The STEAP3/TSAP6 protein was also reduced in lymphocytic cell lines from the patients. Collectively, our data support the hypothesis that STEAP3/TSAP6 deficiency leads to severe anemia in the affected siblings and results from the combination of a mutated allele inherited from their father and a weakly expressed allele inherited from their mother.\n",
      "In this report we describe the occurrence of severe mesomelic shortening of the forearms due to hypoplasia of the ulnae with severe radial bowing. In contrast to the mesomelic dysplasias, i.e. Langer type of mesomelic dwarfism, this apparently autosomal dominantly inherited skeletal anomaly occurred as an isolated anomaly without concomitant involvement of shanks or other parts of the skeleton, and did not influence final adult height.\n",
      "Two sibs with an encephalopathy, including intracerebral calcification and white matter lesions, dwarfism owing to growth hormone deficiency, and retinal degeneration are reported. The onset of the disease in both patients occurred with retardation of motor development during the first year of life. Later, dwarfism, mental retardation, spasticity, ataxia, and retinal degeneration became apparent. These cases probably represent some form of connatal leucodystrophy. The differential diagnosis is discussed.\n",
      "To evaluate the physiologic importance of the different collagen receptors on platelets, we screened 806 patients admitted to the hospital because of hemorrhagic diathesis for eventual laboratory evidence of a pathologic platelet collagen interaction, and found 5 patients with an isolated deficiency in collagen-induced platelet aggregation. Four of these five patients had a partial defect, one had a complete defect. The structural and functional analysis of the platelets from the patient with a complete defect showed a deficiency in glycoprotein (GP) IV and autoantibodies against GPIIb/IIIa, GPIa/IIa, and GPIV. Patient plasma had only a minimal effect on normal control platelets and Naka-negative platelets. The analyses of the defect in the patient and of the data in the literature suggest that a single defect may not result in clinical bleeding (GPIV-deficient patients do not bleed), but may become symptomatic in combination with another defect such as the autoantibodies against GPIa/IIa, GPIV, and/or GPIIb/IIIa, all of which are involved in platelet collagen interactions (three of four of our immune thrombocytopenic purpura patients with anti-GPIV and anti-GPIIb/IIIa autoantibodies had a bleeding disorder). We hypothesize that it is the synergism of two abnormalities that results in the defective function, a mechanism that is in agreement with earlier studies on platelet collagen interaction that suggests that a double defect in platelet collagen interactions is required to become clinically apparent.\n",
      "Mandibuloacral dysplasia (MAD) is a rare form of inherited lipodystrophy. The type B pattern is characterized by a generalized absence of subcutaneous tissues. There is also a deficiency of perivascular adiposity that makes the dissection not only of perforators and their source vessels difficult, but the recipient site vasculature as well. Perforator flaps in the MAD patient by definition will never be bulky, and instead a challenge in every respect as the perforators are extremely diminutive and therefore fragile. However, if a large, thin flap with a long pedicle of reasonable caliber is indicated, the attributes of a perforator flap may still be indicated as demonstrated in this case report for a recalcitrant heel pressure sore that had failed the usual conservative medical treatment.\n",
      "Although patients with mild symptoms of atypical Cockayne syndrome (CS) have been described, there has not been a report of a patient with CS whose only clinical manifestation was cutaneous photosensitivity. Cells from patients with CS show UV sensitivity, reduced recovery of RNA synthesis, but normal UV-induced unscheduled DNA synthesis. On the other hand, the patients with UV-sensitive syndrome have only cutaneous photosensitivity and skin freckles, whereas those cells respond to UV radiation in a similar fashion to the CS cells. We describe a patient with CS who showed only photosensitivity without typical clinical manifestations of CS, but his cells showed UV sensitivity, reduced recovery of RNA synthesis, and normal unscheduled DNA synthesis after UV radiation similar to CS cells. Furthermore, the patient was assigned to complementation group B of CS on the basis of the results of complementation analysis. The present report suggests that CS has a wider spectrum than that considered previously.\n",
      "Perifascicular atrophy of muscle fibers is generally considered to be a specific feature of autoimmune myopathies, dermatomyositis in particular. We describe a neonate presenting with hypotonia and weakness. A biopsy revealed atrophic and regenerating muscle fibers in a perifascicular distribution, and abnormal alkaline phosphatase activity in neighboring perimysial connective tissue. The weakness was nonprogressive and improved on follow-up even though no long-term treatment was administered. We conclude that the presence of perifascicular myopathic changes and muscle fiber atrophy in infants presenting with hypotonia and weakness is neither diagnostic of progressive dermatomyositis, nor a necessary indication for immunosuppressive therapy.\n",
      "Dystroglycan, which serves as a major extracellular matrix receptor in muscle and the central nervous system, requires extensive O-glycosylation to function. We identified a dystroglycan missense mutation (Thr192‚ÜíMet) in a woman with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy and cognitive impairment. A mouse model harboring this mutation recapitulates the immunohistochemical and neuromuscular abnormalities observed in the patient. In vitro and in vivo studies showed that the mutation impairs the receptor function of dystroglycan in skeletal muscle and brain by inhibiting the post-translational modification, mediated by the glycosyltransferase LARGE, of the phosphorylated O-mannosyl glycans on Œ±-dystroglycan that is required for high-affinity binding to laminin.\n",
      "Ectodermal dysplasia with arthrogryposis is an uncommon condition. We describe two daughters of a distant consanguineous couple with oligodentia, enamel abnormalities, camptodactyly, longitudinally broken nails, growth retardation, joint contractures with amyotrophy, hypohidrotic skin with tendency to excessive bruising and scarring after injuries and scratching, kypho-scoliosis, mild facial dysmorphia and microcephaly. The condition is probably due to an autosomal recessive gene, the parents being gypsies of the same ancestral origin.\n",
      "Oculo-palato-cerebral syndrome is an extremely rare disorder consisting of low birth weight, microcephaly, short stature, persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous, microphthalmia, large ears, small hands and feet, cleft palate, joint hypermobility, developmental delay, and cerebral atrophy. There has been one report of a consanguineous family with three affected children, suggesting autosomal recessive inheritance. We report on the second case of this disorder. Our patient, a 2-year-old boy, had growth delay, microcephaly, bilateral persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous with right microphthalmia, long ears with thickened helices, small hands and feet, highly arched palate, joint hypermobility, hypoplastic nails, frontal cerebral atrophy and thinning of the corpus callosum on brain magnetic resonance imaging, and mild developmental delay. He has much milder features than those seen in the previously reported cases.\n",
      "Otopalatodigital syndrome type 2 (OPD2) is an uncommon X-linked condition characterized by dysmorphic facies, a skeletal dysplasia affecting the axial and appendicular skeleton and extraskeletal anomalies including malformations of the brain, heart, genitourinary system, and intestines. Missense mutations of the FLNA gene, which encodes for the protein filamin A, have recently been shown to cause OPD2 and the allelic syndromes otopalatodigital type 1, Melnick-Needles, and frontometaphyseal dysplasia. Collectively these conditions constitute the otopalatodigital spectrum disorders. We report on two sibs affected by OPD2. The diagnosis was achieved at autopsy of a macerated male stillborn with typical external and skeletal findings of OPD2. A subsequent pregnancy was terminated due to ultrasonographic findings resembling those observed in the previous sibling. Histopathological studies revealed osseus sclerosis and do not support the previously reported membranous ossification defect observed in this condition. Mutation analysis demonstrated a novel mutation, 629G>T, in FLNA that had arisen de novo in the mother. This missense mutation predicts the substitution C210F within the second calponin homology domain of the actin-binding domain of filamin A. The identical substitution has been recently identified in an analogous amino-acid position within the actin binding domain of beta-spectrin leading to hereditary spherocytosis. The observation that phenylalanine is normally present in the same position in other proteins (utrophin, dystrophin) but leads to disease when present in filamin A implies that the function and/or structure of these actin binding domains are not entirely equivalent.\n",
      "Oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) is a genetic disease characterized by the reduction or deficiency of melanin in eyes, skin, and hair. OCA exhibits genetic heterogeneity. Presently, there are four types of OCA named as OCA1, OCA2, OCA3, and OCA4. OCA3 is more common in African born blacks but rarely found in other ethnic populations. Our recent genotyping of patients with OCA of Chinese descent has identified two patients who were not OCA1, OCA2, or OCA4. Examination and analysis of the TYRP1 gene identified them to be having OCA3. PCR and DNA sequencing analysis found that the mutant TYPR1 alleles were present in each of the two patients, c.780-791del/c.1067G>A (p.R356Q) and c.625G>TT (p.G209LfsX1)/c.643C>T (p.H215Y). The c.780-791del and c.1067G>A mutations have been already reported. However, the c.625G>TT and c.643C>T mutations have not been previously reported and were found to be maternal and paternal mutations, respectively. Moreover, population screening and bioinformatic analysis were carried out to determine the effects of these two mutations which revealed that both the mutation were pathogenic. Based on the similar mild phenotype of these two patients, we suggest that OCA3 might be prevalent within the Chinese population.\n",
      "We describe another patient with the combination of apple peel intestinal atresia, microcephaly, microphthalmia, and anterior eye chamber anomalies. Development so far seems to be normal, although there is major visual impairment due to the corneal clouding. Mutation analysis of the PAX6, FOX1, PITX2, and MYNC genes was normal as was MLPA for these genes. Autosomal recessive inheritance is possible as recurrence in sibs was described, although germ line mosaicism or a microdeletion due to a very small parental translocation cannot be ruled out.\n",
      "A 51-year-old man presented with a six-year history of gradually progressive exertional dyspnea. His complaint was attributed to increasing age, but evaluation finally led to a diagnosis of diaphragmatic paralysis. Neurological examination disclosed only minimal evidence of weakness of limb muscles. Electromyographic studies suggested a diagnosis of acid maltase deficiency, which was confirmed by electron microscopic and biochemical studies of muscle biopsy sections. Exercise stress testing was necessary to define the limits of the patient's exercise tolerance.\n",
      "We present two cases of posterior amorphous corneal dystrophy in members of the same family. We correlated the clinical findings with refraction, topography, and ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM). This is the first report of UBM findings in amorphous corneal dystrophy and we describe the depth of stromal opacification measured in this exam. Additional cases will be of great help to reinforce these findings.\n",
      "Primordial dwarfism (PD) is a phenotype characterized by profound growth retardation that is prenatal in onset. Significant strides have been made in the last few years toward improved understanding of the molecular underpinning of the limited growth that characterizes the embryonic and postnatal development of PD individuals. These include impaired mitotic mechanics, abnormal IGF2 expression, perturbed DNA-damage response, defective spliceosomal machinery, and abnormal replication licensing. In three families affected by a distinct form of PD, we identified a founder truncating mutation in POC1A. This gene is one of two vertebrate paralogs of POC1, which encodes one of the most abundant proteins in the Chlamydomonas centriole proteome. Cells derived from the index individual have abnormal mitotic mechanics with multipolar spindles, in addition to clearly impaired ciliogenesis. siRNA knockdown of POC1A in fibroblast cells recapitulates this ciliogenesis defect. Our findings highlight a human ciliopathy syndrome caused by deficiency of a major centriolar protein.\n",
      "A disulfide relay system (DRS) was recently identified in the yeast mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS) that consists of two essential components: the sulfhydryl oxidase Erv1 and the redox-regulated import receptor Mia40. The DRS drives the import of cysteine-rich proteins into the IMS via an oxidative folding mechanism. Erv1p is reoxidized within this system, transferring its electrons to molecular oxygen through interactions with cytochrome c and cytochrome c oxidase (COX), thereby linking the DRS to the respiratory chain. The role of the human Erv1 ortholog, GFER, in the DRS has been poorly explored. Using homozygosity mapping, we discovered that a mutation in the GFER gene causes an infantile mitochondrial disorder. Three children born to healthy consanguineous parents presented with progressive myopathy and partial combined respiratory-chain deficiency, congenital cataract, sensorineural hearing loss, and developmental delay. The consequences of the mutation at the level of the patient's muscle tissue and fibroblasts were 1) a reduction in complex I, II, and IV activity; 2) a lower cysteine-rich protein content; 3) abnormal ultrastructural morphology of the mitochondria, with enlargement of the IMS space; and 4) accelerated time-dependent accumulation of multiple mtDNA deletions. Moreover, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae erv1(R182H) mutant strain reproduced the complex IV activity defect and exhibited genetic instability of the mtDNA and mitochondrial morphological defects. These findings shed light on the mechanisms of mitochondrial biogenesis, establish the role of GFER in the human DRS, and promote an understanding of the pathogenesis of a new mitochondrial disease.\n",
      "Alpha-mannosidosis is a rare autosomal recessively inherited lysosomal storage disorder. We describe three patients with alpha-mannosidosis who were born in Troms√∏ between 1983 and 1987, in order to increase awareness of the disease. It is characterized by a typical facial look, with a prominent forehead, hypertelorism, small nose, flat nasal bridge and hypoplastic teeth. The patients are mentally retarded, often have dysostosis multiplex, recurrent infections and typically severe loss of hearing and delayed speech development. The disease is slowly progressive in the first decade, but shows considerable clinical variability. In most cases, the lymphocytes are vacuolized, but diagnosis depends on measurement of alpha-mannosidase activity in the lymphocytes. Prenatal diagnosis is available, based on chorionic villi sampling in the 9th to 11th week of pregnancy. No causal therapy is known, but establishment of the diagnosis is important to avoid complications, recognize hearing loss and provide speech therapy and special education. The specific diagnosis is critical for genetic counselling and prenatal diagnosis. The authors therefore outline the diagnostic strategy.\n",
      "Congenital bronchobiliary fistulas (CBBF) are rare developmental anomalies. We report a case of a 6-day-old newborn who presented with respiratory distress and bilioptysis, originally involving a meconium aspiration syndrome. The diagnosis was confirmed by bronchoscopy. Surgery was performed at the age of 26 days and the newborn died the following day. Operative opacification showed communication between the carina and the biliary system. We review the clinical characteristics of CBBF and the value of early diagnosis and surgical treatment to prevent pulmonary complications due to bile salts.\n",
      "The Microgastria-limb reduction anomaly is a rare disorder of unknown aetiology in which microgastria is associated with limb defects, along with splenic and other variable congenital abnormalities. In 15 previously reported cases, none have had the most extreme form of amelia. We report the clinical progress of a 3-year-old girl with severe microgastria and total amelia who has been managed conservatively with minimal surgical intervention.\n",
      "Protein glycosylation is a complex process that depends not only on the activities of several enzymes and transporters but also on a subtle balance between vesicular Golgi trafficking, compartmental pH, and ion homeostasis. Through a combination of autozygosity mapping and expression analysis in two siblings with an abnormal serum-transferrin isoelectric focusing test (type 2) and a peculiar skeletal phenotype with epiphyseal, metaphyseal, and diaphyseal dysplasia, we identified TMEM165 (also named TPARL) as a gene involved in congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG). The affected individuals are homozygous for a deep intronic splice mutation in TMEM165. In our cohort of unsolved CDG-II cases, we found another individual with the same mutation and two unrelated individuals with missense mutations in TMEM165. TMEM165 encodes a putative transmembrane 324 amino acid protein whose cellular functions are unknown. Using a siRNA strategy, we showed that TMEM165 deficiency causes Golgi glycosylation defects in HEK cells.\n",
      "We report an English kindred affected across 4 generations with a hereditary neuropathy associated with debilitating neuropathic pain as the main clinical feature. The principal finding on clinical examination was sensory loss, and there was variable motor dysfunction. Electrophysiological studies revealed mild features of demyelination with median conduction velocity in the intermediate range. There was an autosomal-dominant pattern of inheritance, and genetic testing revealed a novel heterozygous Trp101X mutation in exon 3 coding for a portion of the extracellular domain of myelin protein zero. This is predicted to lead to premature termination of translation. Myelin protein zero is a key structural component of compact myelin, and over 100 mutations in this protein have been reported, which can give rise to neuropathies with either axonal, demyelinating, or intermediate features encompassing a wide range of severity. Chronic pain is an increasingly recognised sequela of certain hereditary neuropathies and may be musculoskeletal or neuropathic in origin. In this kindred, the neuropathy was relatively mild in severity, however, neuropathic pain was an important and disabling outcome.\n",
      "Mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) is a condition that affects many parts of the body, particularly the brain and muscles. This study examined a Korean MELAS-like syndrome patient with seizure, stroke-like episode, and optic atrophy. Target sequencing of whole mtDNA and 73 nuclear genes identified compound heterozygous mutations p.R205X and p.L255P in the FASTKD2. Each of his unaffected parents has one of the two mutations, and both mutations were not found in 302 controls. FASTKD2 encodes a FAS-activated serine-threonine (FAST) kinase domain 2 which locates in the mitochondrial inner compartment. A FASTKD2 nonsense mutation was once reported as the cause of a recessive infantile mitochondrial encephalomyopathy. The present case showed relatively mild symptoms with a late onset age, compared to a previous patient with FASTKD2 mutation, implicating an inter-allelic clinical heterogeneity. Because this study is the second report of an autosomal recessive mitochondrial encephalomyopathy patient with a FASTKD2 mutation, it will extend the phenotypic spectrum of the FASTKD2 mutation.\n",
      "We present a newly recognized, likely autosomal recessive, pleiotropic disorder seen in four individuals (three siblings and their nephew) from a consanguineous family of Pakistani origin. The condition is characterized by hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, severe microcephaly, sensorineural deafness, moderate learning disability, and distinctive facial dysmorphic features. Autozygosity mapping using SNP array genotyping defined a single, large autozygous region of 13.1√¢‚Ç¨‚Ä∞Mb on chromosome 3p21 common to the affected individuals. The critical region contains 227 genes and initial sequence analysis of a functional candidate gene has not identified causative mutations.\n",
      "We report intermittent seizures, lethargy, and Cohen's syndrome in a 4-year-old girl with hyper-beta-alaninemia and a partial deficiency of beta-alanyl-alpha-ketoglutarate transaminase (AKT). To examine the role of beta-alanine (beta ALA) in cellular metabolism, we cultured her skin fibroblasts in medium containing increasing amounts of beta ALA. At concentrations of 10 to 25 mM, beta ALA caused more than a 50% reduction in the growth of her cells compared with normal control skin fibroblasts. The addition of 0.1 mM of pyridoxine to the culture medium abolished these toxic effects and increased her skin fibroblast AKT enzyme activity more than twofold. During a 2-year period of clinical observation, there were no further episodes of seizures or somnolence in our patient while she received oral pyridoxine therapy.\n",
      "Ring chromosome 10--r(10)--is a rare disorder, with 14 cases reported in the literature, but only two with breakpoint determination by high-resolution techniques. We report here on two patients presenting a ring chromosome 10, studied by G-banding, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) and SNP-array techniques, in order to investigate ring instability and determine breakpoints. Patient 1 showed a r(10)(p15.3q26.2) with a 7.9 Mb deletion in 10q26.2-q26.2, while patient 2 showed a r(10)(p15.3q26.13) with a 1.0 Mb deletion in 10p15.3 and a 8.8 Mb deletion in 10q26.13-q26.3, both unstable. While patient 1 presented with clinical features usually found in patients with r(10) and terminal 10q deletion, patient 2 presented characteristics so far not described in other patients with r(10), such as Dandy-Walker variant, osteopenia, semi-flexed legs, and dermal pigmentation regions. Our data and the data from literature show that there are no specific clinical findings to define a r(10) syndrome.\n",
      "The genetic basis of Developmental Dysphasia is discussed with precise neuropsychological descriptions of 11 cases in six families. In these cases the coexistence in the same family of completely normal and severely impaired siblings suggests a genetic rather than a familial socio-linguistic cause. The possibility of father-son transmission eliminates X-linked inheritance. The results are discussed with a reappraisal of the literature and seem to emphasize the genetic basis, possibly, with autosomal dominant transmission in some cases of Developmental Dysphasia.\n",
      "We describe a four-generation Brazilian family with short tarsus and absence of the lower eyelashes, with normal intelligence. Autosomal dominant inheritance is evident.\n",
      "Ring chromosomes are circular structures formed as a result of breaks in the chromosome arms and the fusion of the proximal broken ends with a loss of distal material, or by fusion of dysfunctional telomeres without any loss. The mechanism underlying this process has not yet been sufficiently explained. Commonly, rings occur as acquired genetic abnormalities; however, sometimes they are found as constitutional aberrations with a prevalence of around 1:50,000 live births. Here, we present a new case of r(9) in a female fetus with intrauterine growth retardation and slight craniofacial dysmorphisms. Both parents had a normal phenotype. Amniotic fluid karyotype showed r(9)(p24q34). An array CGH revealed 3 deletion segments: a ring chromosome with a 2.57-Mb deletion at 9pterp24.2 (chr9:163,131-2,729,722), a 2.60-Mb deletion at 9q34.3qter (chr9:138,523,302-141,122,055), and also a 0.15-Mb interstitial deletion at 9p24.1 (chr9:5,090,443-5,235,765). These deletions overlap with proposed regions for the 9p24.3 deletion and Kleefstra syndrome. Segregation analysis revealed a maternal origin of the rearranged chromosome. We conclude that both the ring chromosome and the interstitial deletion occurred de novo. This last deletion has not been reported before. Prenatal array CGH, combined with fine mapping of breakpoints contributes to the assessment of genotype-phenotype correlations.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) type 3 caused by mutations of the TYRP1 gene is an autosomal recessive disorder of pigmentation characterized by reduced biosynthesis of melanin pigment in the skin, hair, and eye. The clinical phenotype has been reported as mild in Caucasian OCA3 patients. OBJECTIVE: We had the opportunity to examine a Japanese girl with OCA3 and investigated activity of TYRP1 protein derived from the mutant allele detected in the patient. METHODS: Mutation search for OCA responsible genes was done. A mutant allele with a missense mutation was analyzed using melanocyte cultures (b cells) established from a mouse model of OCA3. RESULTS: Compound heterozygous mutations, p.C30R and p.367fsX384, were detected in the Japanese girl. Then we revealed that the missense mutation, p.C30R, was functionally incapable of melanin synthesis with in vitro experiments. CONCLUSION: This is the first report of the occurrence of OCA3 in Japanese population.\n",
      "We report on 2 brothers from a consanguineous Moslem family with prenatal onset of growth deficiency, microcephaly, hypoplastic genitalia, and convulsions from birth. Phenotypic anomalies consisted of a prominent glabella, arched eyebrows, a low upswept frontal hairline, a small pinched nose, large posteriorly rotated ears with overfolded upper helices, partial camptodactyly, and widespaced nipples. Psychomotor development was absent, and there was marked failure to thrive. Death occurred at ages 21 days and 7 months, respectively. Postmortem examination on one child showed dilated cerebral ventricles and hydronephrosis. Microcephaly was detectable by fetal ultrasound in one brother at 17 weeks of gestation.\n",
      "We describe two women who suffer from recurrent fever up to 40 C in association with progesterone action and who have continuously elevated serum levels of immunoreactive tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). In patient 1, recurrent fever began at age 17 yr and has now continued for 11 yr. The patient has had three early pregnancy terminations because of continuous fever and, thereafter, three early pregnancy losses associated with fever. In patient 2, fever first appeared at age 18 yr, and the attacks have now continued for 3 yr. The association between fever and progesterone action is supported by the following facts. 1) The episodes of fever appear in the midluteal phase of the menstrual cycle concomitantly with the highest concentration of serum progesterone. 2) Fever is further exaggerated in early pregnancy. 3) Synthetic progestins induce fever regardless of the day of the menstrual cycle. 4) The progesterone antagonist RU 486 and an agonist of GnRH, nafarelin, are capable of preventing the fever, with no effect on serum cytokine levels. Although the underlying mechanism of elevated TNF alpha and IL-6 levels in our patients remains unknown, the data suggest that these cytokines cooperate with progesterone in exerting a pyrogenic response in the hypothalamic thermoregulatory center.\n",
      "With only a small number of cases in the medical literature, mosaic trisomy 15 in liveborn infants is very rare. Despite its rarity, similar features among individuals have been described, including intrauterine growth retardation, craniofacial abnormalities and facial dysmorphisms, cardiac disease, and other organ anomalies. Very few liveborns have survived the first year of life. We report here on a term infant with growth restriction and multiple congenital anomalies who was found to have mosaic trisomy 15. The proband presented with some frequently reported findings such as dysmorphic facies and overlapping fingers, and the uncommon finding of whorled hypopigmentation. Previously unreported findings include abnormal cerebral vasculature and dysplastic kidneys. We add this new phenotypic information to widen the spectrum previously reported and provide a review of the literature to date.\n",
      "Inborn errors of DNA repair or replication underlie a variety of clinical phenotypes. We studied 5 patients from 4 kindreds, all of whom displayed intrauterine growth retardation, chronic neutropenia, and NK cell deficiency. Four of the 5 patients also had postnatal growth retardation. The association of neutropenia and NK cell deficiency, which is unusual among primary immunodeficiencies and bone marrow failures, was due to a blockade in the bone marrow and was mildly symptomatic. We discovered compound heterozygous rare mutations in Go-Ichi-Ni-San (GINS) complex subunit 1 (GINS1, also known as PSF1) in the 5 patients. The GINS complex is essential for eukaryotic DNA replication, and homozygous null mutations of GINS component-encoding genes are embryonic lethal in mice. The patients' fibroblasts displayed impaired GINS complex assembly, basal replication stress, impaired checkpoint signaling, defective cell cycle control, and genomic instability, which was rescued by WT GINS1. The residual levels of GINS1 activity reached 3% to 16% in patients' cells, depending on their GINS1 genotype, and correlated with the severity of growth retardation and the in vitro cellular phenotype. The levels of GINS1 activity did not influence the immunological phenotype, which was uniform. Autosomal recessive, partial GINS1 deficiency impairs DNA replication and underlies intra-uterine (and postnatal) growth retardation, chronic neutropenia, and NK cell deficiency.\n",
      "In 1965, an adult-onset, autosomal dominant disorder with a peculiar scapuloperoneal distribution of weakness and atrophy was described in a large, multi-generation kindred and named 'scapuloperoneal syndrome type Kaeser' (OMIM #181400). By genetic analysis of the original kindred, we discovered a heterozygous missense mutation of the desmin gene (R350P) cosegregating with the disorder. Moreover, we detected DES R350P in four unrelated German families allowing for genotype-phenotype correlations in a total of 15 patients carrying the same mutation. Large clinical variability was recognized, even within the same family, ranging from scapuloperoneal (n = 2, 12%), limb girdle (n = 10, 60%) and distal phenotypes (n = 3, 18%) with variable cardiac (n = 7, 41%) or respiratory involvement (n = 7, 41%). Facial weakness, dysphagia and gynaecomastia were frequent additional symptoms. Overall and within each family, affected men seemingly bear a higher risk of sudden, cardiac death as compared to affected women. Moreover, histological and immunohistochemical examination of muscle biopsy specimens revealed a wide spectrum of findings ranging from near normal or unspecific pathology to typical, myofibrillar changes with accumulation of desmin. This study reveals that the clinical and pathological variability generally observed in desminopathies may not be attributed to the nature of the DES mutation alone, but may be influenced by additional genetic and epigenetic factors such as gender. In addition, mutations of the desmin gene should be considered early in the diagnostic work-up of any adult-onset, dominant myopathy, even if specific myofibrillar pathology is absent.\n",
      "We report a man with longstanding undiagnosed adrenal insufficiency. At 37, our patient is the oldest reported case. Although most cases of Allgrove syndrome are diagnosed during childhood, awareness of this condition when undiagnosed in adults is crucial, as it is life threatening, and can severely affect neurological, sexual and psychological function.\n",
      "We present 2 unrelated children with a distinct pattern of anomalies, including mental retardation, hearing impairment, unusual facial appearance, and skeletal defects. Both children have severe behavior disturbance and hyperactivity. The characteristic facial findings include a broad mouth, broad nasal bridge, mildly anteverted nares with a fleshy nasal tip, and deep nasolabial folds. Skeletal findings include mild to moderate short stature, dysharmonic maturation of epiphyseal ossification centers in the hands, and mild scoliosis.\n",
      "Acute annular outer retinopathy is an uncommon disorder of uncertain aetiology characterized by a unilateral visual field defect with an irregular annular band of grey-white, deep retinal opacification in a peripapillary location. Acute annular outer retinopathy is considered to be a variant of acute zonal occult outer retinopathy. The case is reported of acute annular outer retinopathy with spontaneous good visual recovery and no ophthalmoscopic sequelae.\n",
      "The acidic fibroblast growth factor (FGF) intracellular binding protein (FIBP) interacts directly with the fibroblast growth factor FGF1. Although FIBP is known to be implicated in the FGF signaling pathway, its precise function remains unclear. Gain-of-function variants in several FGF receptors (FGFRs) are implicated in a wide spectrum of growth disorders from achondroplasia to overgrowth syndromes. In a unique case from a consanguineous union presenting with overgrowth, macrocephaly, retinal coloboma, large thumbs, severe varicose veins and learning disabilities, exome sequencing identified a homozygous nonsense FIBP variant. The patient's fibroblasts exhibit FIBP cDNA degradation and an increased proliferation capacity compared with controls. The phenotype defines a new multiple congenital abnormalities (MCA) syndrome, overlapping with the heterogeneous group of overgrowth syndromes with macrocephaly. The different clinical features can be explained by the alteration of the FGFR pathway. Taken together, these results suggest the implication of FIBP in a new autosomal recessive MCA.\n",
      "CONTEXT: Agenesis of the internal carotid artery and hypoplasia of the internal carotid artery are rare congenital abnormalities, involving less than 0.01% of the general population. Congenital hypopituitarism is also a rare condition; thus, the association of the two entities is unlikely to be casual. We describe one pediatric case of agenesis of the internal carotid artery with hypopituitarism and review other known cases. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION AND SYNTHESIS: In this brief clinical case seminar, we summarize the current understanding of this association based on a MEDLINE search of all peer-reviewed publications (original articles and reviews) on this topic between 1980 and 2011. We found nine other cases, mainly diagnosed during childhood. Defects of pituitary function varied among cases; in four, midline anomalies were present. CONCLUSION: There are two theories that are not mutually exclusive to explain the association of congenital vascular malformation and pituitary hypoplasia with hypopituitarism: the first involves hemodynamic mechanisms, and the second, complex neural-crest differentiation and/or migration disorders. Whatever the real physiopathological mechanism responsible for this condition, it could be considered as a new clinical entity.\n",
      "A series of 44 unrelated patients in whom COL2A1 screening demonstrated normal results but whose phenotype was nevertheless highly suggestive of either Stickler syndrome (with ocular involvement) or Marshall syndrome were investigated for mutations in the COL11A1 gene. Heterozygous COL11A1 mutations were found in 10 individuals. A splice site alteration (involving introns 47-55) was present in seven cases, with one in intron 50 (c.3816 + 1G > A) occurring in three patients. Two patients had a different deletion, and a missense mutation (Gly1471Asp) was observed in one case. In 4/10 patients the phenotype was classified as Marshall syndrome because of early-onset severe hearing loss and characteristic facial features. These four patients were all heterozygous for a splice site mutation in intron 50. One of these cases had a type 1 vitreous anomaly despite the presence of a COL11A1 mutation. The remaining 6/10 patients had an overlapping Marshall-Stickler phenotype with less pronounced facial features. None of these had a mutation in the hot spot region of intron 50.\n",
      "Exome sequencing identified homozygous loss-of-function variants in DIAPH1 (c.2769delT; p.F923fs and c.3145C>T; p.R1049X) in four affected individuals from two unrelated consanguineous families. The affected individuals in our report were diagnosed with postnatal microcephaly, early-onset epilepsy, severe vision impairment, and pulmonary symptoms including bronchiectasis and recurrent respiratory infections. A heterozygous DIAPH1 mutation was originally reported in one family with autosomal dominant deafness. Recently, however, a homozygous nonsense DIAPH1 mutation (c.2332C4T; p.Q778X) was reported in five siblings in a single family affected by microcephaly, blindness, early onset seizures, developmental delay, and bronchiectasis. The role of DIAPH1 was supported using parametric linkage analysis, RNA and protein studies in their patients' cell lines and further studies in human neural progenitors cells and a diap1 knockout mouse. In this report, the proband was initially brought to medical attention for profound metopic synostosis. Additional concerns arose when his head circumference did not increase after surgical release at 5 months of age and he was diagnosed with microcephaly and epilepsy at 6 months of age. Clinical exome analysis identified a homozygous DIAPH1 mutation. Another homozygous DIAPH1 mutation was identified in the research exome analysis of a second family with three siblings presenting with a similar phenotype. Importantly, no hearing impairment is reported in the homozygous affected individuals or in the heterozygous carrier parents in any of the families demonstrating the autosomal recessive microcephaly phenotype. These additional families provide further evidence of the likely causal relationship between DIAPH1 mutations and a neurodevelopmental disorder.\n",
      "Obesity is a highly heritable condition and a risk factor for other diseases, including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and cancer. Recently, genomic copy number variation (CNV) has been implicated in cases of early onset obesity that may be comorbid with intellectual disability. Here, we describe a recurrent CNV that causes a syndrome associated with intellectual disability, seizures, macrocephaly, and obesity. This unbalanced chromosome translocation leads to duplication of over 100 genes on chromosome 12, including the obesity candidate gene G protein √é¬≤3 (GNB3). We generated a transgenic mouse model that carries an extra copy of GNB3, weighs significantly more than its wild-type littermates, and has excess intraabdominal fat accumulation. GNB3 is highly expressed in the brain, consistent with G-protein signaling involved in satiety and/or metabolism. These functional data connect GNB3 duplication and overexpression to elevated body mass index and provide evidence for a genetic syndrome caused by a recurrent CNV.\n",
      "Stickler syndrome is characterized by ocular, auditory, skeletal, and orofacial abnormalities. We describe a family with autosomal recessive Stickler syndrome. The main clinical findings consisted of high myopia, vitreoretinal degeneration, retinal detachment, hearing loss, and short stature. Affected family members were found to have a homozygous loss-of-function mutation in COL9A2, c.843_c.846‚Äâ+‚Äâ4del8. A family with autosomal recessive Stickler syndrome was previously described and found to have a homozygous loss-of-function mutation in COL9A1. COL9A1, COL9A2, and COL9A3 code for collagen IX. All three collagen IX Œ± chains, Œ±1, Œ±2, and Œ±3, are needed for formation of functional collagen IX molecule. In dogs, two causative loci have been identified in autosomal recessive oculoskeletal dysplasia. This dysplasia resembles Stickler syndrome. Recently, homozygous loss-of-function mutations in COL9A2 and COL9A3 were found to co-segregate with the loci. Together the data from the present study and the previous studies suggest that loss-of-function mutations in any of the collagen IX genes can cause autosomal recessive Stickler syndrome.\n",
      "CONTEXT:Mosaic trisomy 9 is considered to be a rare chromosomal abnormality with limited survival. Our objective was to report on two patients with mosaic trisomy 9 presenting unusual findings and prolonged survival. CASE REPORTS:The first patient was a boy aged six years and five months presenting weight of 14.5 kg (< P3), height of 112 cm (P10), head circumference of 49 cm (P2), prominent forehead, triangular and asymmetric face, thin lips, right microtia with overfolded helix, small hands, micropenis (< P10), small testes and hallux valgus. His lymphocyte karyotype was mos 47,XY,+9[4]/46,XY[50]. Additional cytogenetic assessment of the skin showed normal results. The second patient was a two-year-old girl who was initially assessed at five months of age, when she presented weight of 5.3 kg (< P3), height of 61.5 cm (P2-P10), head circumference of 40.5 cm (P25), sparse hair, micrognathia, right ear with overfolded helix and preauricular pit, triphalangeal thumbs and sacral dimple. She also had a history of congenital heart disease, hearing loss, hypotonia, delayed neuropsychomotor development and swallowing disorder. Her lymphocyte karyotype was mos 47,XX,+9[3]/46,XX[69]. Both patients had unusual clinical findings (the first, hemifacial hypoplasia associated with microtia, with a phenotype of oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum, and the second, triphalangeal thumbs and hearing loss) and survival greater than what is usually described in the literature (< 1 year). Further reports will be critical for delineating the clinical features and determining the evolution of patients with mosaic trisomy 9.\n",
      "Pearson syndrome (PS) is a rare, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletion disorder mainly affecting hematopoietic system and exocrine pancreas in early infancy, which is characterized by multi-organ involvement, variable manifestations and poor prognosis. Since the clinical complexity and uncertain outcome of PS, the ability to early diagnose and anticipate disease progression is of great clinical importance. We described a patient with severe anemia and hyperglycinemia at birth was diagnosed with neonatal diabetes mellitus, and later with PS. Genetic testing revealed that a novel mtDNA deletion existed in various non-invasive tissues from the patient. The disease course was monitored by mtDNA deletion heteroplasmy and mtDNA/nucleus DNA genome ratio in different tissues and at different time points, showing a potential genotype-phenotype correlation. Our findings suggest that for patient suspected for PS, it may be therapeutically important to first perform detailed mtDNA analysis on non-invasive tissues at the initial diagnosis and during disease progression.\n",
      "LIM homeodomain transcription factors regulate many aspects of development in multicellular organisms. LHX4/Lhx4 is a protein that is essential for pituitary development and motor neuron specification in mammals. In human, a heterozygous splicing mutation of the LHX4 gene was reported in a family with combined pituitary hormone deficiencies (CPHD). In addition to CPHD, these patients were characterized by small sella turcica and chiari malformation. Here we report a Japanese patient with CPHD (GH, PRL, TSH, LH, FSH, and ACTH deficiency) due to a novel missense mutation (P366T) of the LHX 4 gene. She showed severe respiratory disease and hypoglycemia soon after birth. Brain MRI demonstrated hypoplastic anterior pituitary, ectopic posterior lobe, a poorly developed sella turcica, and chiari malformation. Sequence analysis of the LHX 4 gene identified a heterozygous missense mutation (P366T) in exon 6, which was present in LIM4 specific domain. Neither of the patient's parents harbored this mutation, indicating de novo mutation.\n",
      "Aprosencephaly is a rare, lethal malformation sequence of the central nervous system that has been attributed to a postneuralation encephaloclastic process. We describe autopsy findings consistent with aprosencephaly in 2 fetuses conceived from a consanguineous mating (first cousins). Both showed anencephalic manifestations; however, the crania were intact, with fused sutures. The neuropathologic findings were essentially identical. Each fetus had complete absence of the telecephalon and pyramidal tracts, rudimentary diencephalic and mesencephalic structures, primitive cerebellar hemispheres, posterolateral clusters of primitive neural cells in the medullas suggesting an abnormality of neural migration, a normally-formed spinal cord, and retinal dysplasia within normally-formed globes. In addition, both fetuses manifested a peculiar perivascular mesenchymal proliferation seen only within the central nervous system. The similarity of these cases, coupled with parental consanguinity, suggests a primary malformation in brain development due to the homozygous representation of a mutant allele. We hypothesize that these patients may represent a defect in a gene important in brain development, the nature of which has yet to be elucidated.\n",
      "Fumarase deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive metabolic condition. We report on a sibship with molecularly confirmed fumarase deficiency. Prenatal findings included agenesis of the corpus callosum, ventriculomegaly, and ventriculoseptal defect. The postnatal course was significant for metabolic acidosis ultimately leading to death around 3 weeks of age. Postmortem findings were noted including swollen mitochondria with abnormal cristae on electron microscopy within the liver. Molecular testing revealed a novel whole gene deletion in conjunction with a point mutation. While the point mutation has been previously reported, the detection of a whole gene deletion has not been described to date in an individual with fumarase deficiency.\n",
      "A grandmother, her three children, and three grandchildren had skeletal abnormalities consisting of a short stature, bilateral symmetrical very short, broad and bowed radii, very short and broad ulna, mildly short lower legs, short proximal end of fibula, abnormal ankles, abnormal calcaneus and talus and pes equinus. They had normal craniofacial features, normal intelligence and normal chromosomes. We concluded that this skeletal dysplasia resembles the autosomal dominant mesomelic dysplasia, Kantaputra type. Prenatal diagnosis by ultrasound examination early in the pregnancy was possible. We found no evidence for a SHOX gene deletion or point mutation. As far as we know this is the third reported family with this skeletal dysplasia.\n",
      "Two sisters, aged 18 and 11 years, were found to have an intrauterine growth retardation-malformation syndrome which included camptodactyly as a typical sign. The overall analysis of the clinical and radiological findings permitted the individualization of a distinct entity. The family data suggested autosomal recessive inheritance.\n",
      "Meacham syndrome is a rare sporadically occurring multiple malformation syndrome characterized by male pseudohermaphroditism with abnormal internal female genitalia comprising a uterus and double or septate vagina, complex congenital heart defect and diaphragmatic abnormalities. We report on eight new cases of this condition, two of whom were shown to have heterozygous missense mutations in the C-terminal zinc finger domains of WT1: Arg366Cys and Arg394Trp. These data represent clinical and molecular evidence that the WT1 gene plays a central role in normal development of the diaphragm and the proepicardially derived tissues. Identification of WT1 expression in the region of coelomic mesothelium which will form the proepicardium and diaphragm provides a plausible unifying patterning defect in these cases. Interestingly, the Arg366Cys mutation has been previously reported in Denys-Drash syndrome and Arg394Trp mutation has been previously reported in both isolated Wilms tumor and Denys-Drash syndrome. This phenotypic diversity with a single mutation suggests there are other factors modulating all aspects of WT1 function during human development. If genetic modifiers of WT1 can be identified in animal models these become good candidate genes for the cases with Meacham syndrome we report on here where WT1 mutations cannot be identified.\n",
      "We report a 3-generation pedigree with 5 individuals affected with a dominantly inherited macrothrombocytopenia. All 5 carry 2 nonsynonymous mutations resulting in a D723H mutation in the beta3 integrin and a P53L mutation in glycoprotein (GP) Ibalpha. We show that GPIbalpha-L53 is phenotypically silent, being also present in 3 unaffected pedigree members and in 7 of 1639 healthy controls. The beta3-H723 causes constitutive, albeit partial, activation of the alphaIIbbeta3 complex by disruption of the highly conserved cytoplasmic salt bridge with arginine 995 in the alphaIIb integrin as evidenced by increased PAC-1 but not fibrinogen binding to the patients' resting platelets. This was confirmed in CHO alphaIIbbeta3-H723 transfectants, which also exhibited increased PAC-1 binding, increased adhesion to von Willebrand factor (VWF) in static conditions and to fibrinogen under shear stress. Crucially, we show that in the presence of fibrinogen, alphaIIbbeta3-H723, but not wild-type alphaIIbbeta3, generates a signal that leads to the formation of proplatelet-like protrusions in transfected CHO cells. Abnormal proplatelet formation was confirmed in the propositus's CD34+ stem cell-derived megakaryocytes. We conclude that the constitutive activation of the alphaIIbbeta3-H723 receptor causes abnormal proplatelet formation, leading to incorrect sizing of platelets and the thrombocytopenia observed in the pedigree.\n",
      "We present five patients with the clinical diagnosis of Fountain's syndrome, an autosomal recessive entity with mental retardation, deafness, skeletal abnormalities and coarse face with full lips as cardinal features and review all cases reported so far. We report two new isolated cases, and present follow-up data on three previously reported patients. The clinical features of all these patients are presented to further delineate the clinical picture and the natural course of this rare syndrome. We propose that epilepsy, short stature, large head circumference, broad, plump hands and the remarkable behavior are important accessory findings of this syndrome. The clinical features of this syndrome become more evident with advancing age.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Nephrogenic syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (NSIAD) is a disorder of water balance linked to gain-of-function mutation of arginine vasopressin receptor type 2 (AVPR2) resulting in free water reabsorption and episodes of hyponatremia. AIMS: To review the long-term treatment of NSIAD. METHODS: In the first part of this paper, we report 3 cases of male patients presenting with hyponatremia due to NSIAD. The second part consists of a comprehensive review of all published case reports. RESULTS: In our experience, long-term fluid restriction (FR) and treatment with low doses of urea are efficient and well tolerated. Episodic intake of urea seems sufficient in some patients. Treatment data were available for 13 of the 16 hyponatremic patients reported in the literature. Each of these 13 patients had regulated fluid intake. Six of the patients received urea with no reported failure to correct hyponatremia and 5 received NaCl supplementation with varying efficacy. The AVPR2 antagonists tolvaptan and satavaptan (prescribed before the diagnosis of NSIAD was made) showed no efficacy in 1 patient. CONCLUSIONS: NSIAD is quite easy to treat with FR and urea in adults as well as in children, with good compliance and efficacy. Of note, FR is well tolerated, suggesting that NSIAD may differ from other causes of syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion by reduction of thirst intensity due to lower levels of AVP (which stimulates thirst). In eventual refractory cases, furosemide (associated with NaCl supplementation) would represent a valuable therapeutic option by analogy of its efficacy in syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion.\n",
      "An uncharacterized multisystemic mitochondrial cytopathy was diagnosed in two infants from consanguineous Palestinian kindred living in a single village. The most significant clinical findings were tubulopathy (hyperuricemia, metabolic alkalosis), pulmonary hypertension, and progressive renal failure in infancy (HUPRA syndrome). Analysis of the consanguineous pedigree suggested that the causative mutation is in the nuclear DNA. By using genome-wide SNP homozygosity analysis, we identified a homozygous identity-by-descent region on chromosome 19 and detected the pathogenic mutation c.1169A>G (p.Asp390Gly) in SARS2, encoding the mitochondrial seryl-tRNA synthetase. The same homozygous mutation was later identified in a third infant with HUPRA syndrome. The carrier rate of this mutation among inhabitants of this Palestinian isolate was found to be 1:15. The mature enzyme catalyzes the ligation of serine to two mitochondrial tRNA isoacceptors: tRNA(Ser)(AGY) and tRNA(Ser)(UCN). Analysis of amino acylation of the two target tRNAs, extracted from immortalized peripheral lymphocytes derived from two patients, revealed that the p.Asp390Gly mutation significantly impacts on the acylation of tRNA(Ser)(AGY) but probably not that of tRNA(Ser)(UCN). Marked decrease in the expression of the nonacylated transcript and the complete absence of the acylated tRNA(Ser)(AGY) suggest that this mutation leads to significant loss of function and that the uncharged transcripts undergo degradation.\n",
      "To define the phenotype and elucidate the molecular basis for an autosomal recessively inherited optic atrophy and auditory neuropathy in a consanguineous family with two affected children.Family members underwent detailed ophthalmologic, electrophysiological, and audiological assessments. An autozygosity mapping strategy using high-density single nucleotide polymorphism microarrays and microsatellite markers was used to detect regions of genome homozygosity that might contain the disease gene. Candidate genes were then screened for mutations by direct sequencing.Both affected subjects had poor vision from birth and complained of progressive visual loss over time. Current visual acuity ranged from 6/60 to 6/120. Fundus examination revealed bilateral temporal optic nerve pallor in both patients with otherwise normal retinal findings. International-standard full-field electroretinograms were normal in both individuals, with no evidence of generalized retinal dysfunction. Pattern cortical visual evoked potentials were grossly abnormal bilaterally in both cases. The pattern electroretinogram N95:P50 ratio was subnormal, and the P50 was of shortened peak time bilaterally in both patients. The electrophysiological findings were consistent with bilateral retinal ganglion cell/optic nerve dysfunction. Audiological investigation in both siblings revealed abnormalities falling within the auditory neuropathy/dysynchrony spectrum. There were no auditory symptoms and good outer hair cell function (as demonstrated by transient evoked otoacoustic emissions) but impaired inner hair cell/neural function with abnormal stapedial reflex thresholds and abnormal or absent auditory brainstem-evoked responses. The single nucleotide polymorphism microarray data demonstrated a 24.17 Mb region of homozygosity at 11q14.1-11q22.3, which was confirmed by microsatellite marker analysis. The candidate target region contained the transmembrane protein 126A (TMEM126A) gene, and direct sequencing identified a previously described nonsense mutation (c.163C>T; p.Arg55X).We describe the first detailed phenotyping of patients with autosomal recessive TMEM126A-associated optic atrophy and auditory neuropathy. These findings will facilitate the identification of individuals with this recently described disorder.\n",
      "Two unrelated children presented with similar clinical features (facial dysmorphism and multiple joint dislocations) suggesting the diagnosis of Larsen syndrome. Both carried an inherited unbalanced translocation resulting in partial trisomy 1q and partial monosomy 6p. Analysis of skin collagen from one of the probands disclosed a decreased alpha 1/alpha 2 chain ratio of collagen type I, increased thermal stability and increased hydroxylation of proline and lysine. The present findings suggest that, as a result of the chromosome rearrangements, both patients have a mutation on a gene involved in collagen production, located either on chromosome 1q or, more probably, on 6p. It is furthermore suggested that other cases of Larsen syndrome are the result of a similar mutation.\n",
      "A minority of collodion babies, called 'self-healing collodion babies', heal spontaneously. We describe a novel clinical phenotype of acral self-healing collodion baby caused by a new TGM1 mutation. The proband, born to healthy parents, presented at birth as a collodion baby strictly localized to the extremities. The skin condition returned to normal at the age of 3 weeks. The older sister was born as a generalized collodion baby; the condition then developed into lamellar ichthyosis. Molecular analysis of TGM1 revealed three novel mutations in the family. The proband was compound heterozygous for the p.Val359Met and p.Arg396His mutations, whereas the older sister was compound heterozygous for p.Arg396His and a deletion mutation c.1922_1926+2delGGCCTGT. Structural modelling of the p.Val359Met mutation suggested a minor disruption of the protein structure, whereas a modification of protein-protein interaction was predicted for p.Arg396His. These predictions corroborated the analysis of recombinant transglutaminase (TGase)-1 proteins carrying the p.Val359Met and p.Arg396His mutations. Both showed decreased levels of protein expression: p.Val359Met displayed residual activity (12.8%), while p.Arg396His caused a dramatic loss of activity (3.3%). These observations demonstrate for the first time that TGM1 mutations can be associated with acral self-healing collodion baby, and expand the clinical spectrum of TGase-1 deficiency.\n",
      "Case report concerning a 14-year-old girl who, like her father and father's sister, is suffering from spontaneous, recurring of bilateral corneal erosions, the first symptoms occurred when she was nine. Her father suffered several attacks each year between the ages of 11 to 25, but has since been completely asymptomatic. An autosomal dominant mode of inheritance is assumed.\n",

[1984] in this journal, i.e., Potter sequence with persistent buccopharyngeal membrane type II, postaxial polydactyly, cleft palate, cardiac anomalies, intestinal nonfixation, and intrauterine growth retardation. This specific complex MCA syndrome is not associated with a detectable chromosome abnormality.\n",
      "We describe a three-generation family with an autosomal dominant hidrotic ectodermal dysplasia consisting mainly of tricho- and onychodysplasia. One of the patients had supraventricular tachycardia, another had palpitations, and two others had sinus brachycardia. We consider that the clinical manifestations in this family differ significantly from those of the Clouston syndrome (their previous diagnosis) and places them in Group A, subgroup 1-3 (tricho-onychic) of the ectodermal dysplasia classification proposed by Freire-Maia and Pinheiro [1988, \"Ectodermal Dysplasias\"].\n",
      "The ornithine decarboxylase 1 (ODC1) gene plays an important role in physiological and cell developmental processes including embryogenesis, organogenesis, and neoplastic cell growth. Here, we report an 32-month-old Caucasian female with a heterozygous de novo nonsense mutation in the ODC1 gene that leads to a premature abrogation of 14-aa residues at the ODC protein c-terminus. This is the first human case confirming similar symptoms observed in a transgenic ODC1 mouse model first described over 20‚Äâyears ago. Phenotypic manifestations include macrosomia, macrocephaly, developmental delay, alopecia, spasticity, hypotonia, cutaneous vascular malformation, delayed visual maturation, and sensorineural hearing loss. We here describe for the first time a new pediatric disorder that is directly linked to a de novo pathogenic variant in the ODC1 gene. The ODC1 gene mutation (c.1342 A>T) was identified by whole-exome sequencing and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Red blood cells obtained from our patient showed elevated ODC protein and polyamine levels compared to healthy controls. Our autosomal dominant patient who carries this gain-of-function ODC1 mutation may benefit from treatment with Œ±-difluoromethylornithine, a well-tolerated, U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). FDA-approved drug.\n",
      "The clinical, radiologic, histopathologic, and genetic features of a sclerosing bone dysplasia found in three members of a family are described. The bone disorder affected all metaphyseal-diaphyseal regions of all long bones, the skull, and three metacarpals. All affected members also had ichthyosis vulgaris and premature ovarian failure. These features have not been reported before, indicating a new syndrome.\n",
      "A woman and her two children had apparent dominantly inherited ocular abnormalities including aniridia, ptosis, nystagmus, corneal pannus, persistent pupillary membrane, lenticular opacities, and foveal hypoplasia. A broad spectrum of iris abnormalities was observed: the daughter had aniridia with persistent pupillary membrane strands traversing the anterior lens capsule; the iris of the mother and son had a velvety surface with no detailed crypts, but did have some persistent pupillary membrane tags extending from the collarette. All three family members had moderately severe bilateral ptosis, pendular nystagmus, corneal pannus, and visual acuity of 20/200. Several systemic abnormalities also were noted, including obesity and mental retardation in the two children, and alopecia, cardiac abnormalities, and frequent spontaneous abortion in the mother. Family history indicated that the children's maternal grandmother also had similar ocular findings. We believe that this constellation of findings represents a rare, apparently dominant, variant of aniridia.\n",
      "In this report we describe an apparently new MCA-MR syndrome with Dandy-Walker malformation in three severely mentally retarded siblings born to normal, non-consanguineous parents.

      "Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2 (CMT2) is characterized by a motor conduction velocity of the median nerve of > 38 m/sec and is a genetically heterogeneous disorder with at least three loci identified: CMT2A (1p35-36), CMT2B (3q13-22), CMT2C (not linked to any known loci), and CMT2D (7p14). In this study, we performed linkage analysis of two Japanese CMT2 families using markers flanking the CMT2A, CMT2B, and CMT2D loci. The highest cumulative multipoint lod score of 3.69 was obtained at D1S244. The CMT2B and CMT2D loci were excluded by the results of linkage analysis performed using markers D3S1551, D3S1290, and D7S484. The clinical features of the CMT2A affecting the two families include similar levels of muscle weakness of the posterior and anterior tibial muscles, tendon reflexes preserved in upper extremities but reduced or absent in lower extremities, no enlargement of the peripheral nerves, and mild sensory disturbance in only 20% of affected individuals.\n",

      "Polyhydramnios, megalencephaly, and symptomatic epilepsy syndrome (PMSE) is an ultra rare neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by severe, infantile-onset intractable epilepsy, neurocognitive delay, macrocephaly, and craniofacial dysmorphism. The molecular diagnosis of this condition has thus far only been made in 16 Old Order Mennonite patients carrying a homozygous 7‚Äâkb founder deletion of exons 9-13 of STRADA. We performed clinical whole exome sequencing (WES) on a 4-year-old Indian male with global developmental delay, history of failure to thrive, infantile spasms, repetitive behaviors, hypotonia, low muscle mass, marked joint laxity, and dysmorphic facial features including tall forehead, long face, arched eyebrows, small chin, wide mouth, and tented upper lip. A homozygous single nucleotide duplication, c.842dupA (p.D281fs), in exon 10 of STRADA was identified. Sanger sequencing confirmed the mutation in the individual and identified both parents as carriers. In light of the molecular discoveries, the patient's clinical phenotype was considered to be a good fit for PMSE. We identified for the first time a homozygous point mutation in STRADA causing PMSE. Additional bi-allelic mutations related to PMSE thus far have not been observed in Baylor ‚àº6,000 consecutive clinical WES cases, supporting the rarity of this disorder. Our findings may have treatment implications for the patient since previous studies have shown rapamycin as a potential therapeutic agent for the seizures and cognitive problems in PMSE patients. ¬© 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\n",
      "Cross syndrome is a rare syndrome characterized by ocular and cutaneous hypopigmentation and neurological manifestations. A few reports have been published since 1967.

      "The short rib-polydactyly (SRP) group are lethal skeletal dysplasias with an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern that can be distinguished on radiological and histological grounds. We report on two consecutive pregnancies complicated by a SRP syndrome with acromesomelic hypomineralization and campomelia that cannot be definitely categorized, yet possesses features of this group of conditions. The skeletal changes observed in both cases included markedly shortened ribs, shortened humeri and femora, limb bowing, absent ossification of the radii, ulnae, tibiae and fibulae, as well as the bony elements of the hands and feet, hypoplastic scapulae and peritoneal calcifications. In one case, the pancreas was abnormal in shape, without a tail and the spleen was not identified. Ectopic splenic tissue and intestinal malrotation were identified and were suggestive of a laterality disorder. Whether these two cases should be considered an atypical form of SRP cannot be completely resolved at this present time and will need to wait on further progress in molecular testing.\n",
      "Four unrelated patients having an unusual clinical phenotype, including multiple peripheral nerve sheath tumors, are reported. Their clinical features were not typical of any known familial tumor syndrome. The patients had multiple painful neurofibromas, including bilateral orbital plexiform neurofibromas, and spinal as well as mucosal neurofibromas. In addition, they exhibited a marfanoid habitus, shared similar facial features, and had enlarged corneal nerves as well as neuronal migration defects. Comprehensive NF1, NF2 and SMARCB1 mutation analyses revealed no mutation in blood lymphocytes and in schwann cells cultured from plexiform neurofibromas. Furthermore, no mutations in RET, PRKAR1A, PTEN and other RAS-pathway genes were found in blood leukocytes. Collectively, the clinical and pathological findings in these four cases fit no known syndrome and likely represent a new disorder.\n",

      "Larsen syndrome is characterized by the dislocation of large joints and other less consistent clinical findings. Heterozygous FLNB mutations account for the majority of Larsen syndrome cases, but biallelic mutations in CHST3 and B4GALT7 have been more recently described, thus confirming the existence of recessive forms of the disease. In a multiplex consanguineous Saudi family affected by severe and recurrent large joint dislocation and severe myopia, we identified a homozygous truncating variant in GZF1 through a combined autozygome and exome approach. Independently, the same approach identified a second homozygous truncating GZF1 variant in another multiplex consanguineous family affected by severe myopia, retinal detachment, and milder skeletal involvement. GZF1 encodes GDNF-inducible zinc finger protein 1, a transcription factor of unknown developmental function, which we found to be expressed in the eyes and limbs of developing mice. Global transcriptional profiling of cells from affected individuals revealed a shared pattern of gene dysregulation and significant enrichment of genes encoding matrix proteins, including P3H2, which hints at a potential disease mechanism. Our results suggest that GZF1 mutations cause a phenotype of severe myopia and significant articular involvement not previously described in Larsen syndrome.\n",
      "To highlight the varied clinical manifestations and management of idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome, a rare disorder in children.Retrospective review of case records of 3 patients who were diagnosed to have idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome (IHES) in a tertiary referral centre between 1997 and 2010 was performed. These 3 children presented with different symptoms and the first case had cardiac involvement. All had very high absolute eosinophil count (cells/mm(3)) 43,206, 9,082, 2,925, respectively. Diagnosis was confirmed by bone marrow biopsy in all three cases and supported by liver biopsy in the first two cases and inguinal lymphnode biopsy in the last case. All 3 children responded to treatment with steroids, with only second patient requiring hydroxyurea to control disease.Case 1 and 2 are on follow up for 13 y and 10 y respectively and both are asymptomatic. Case 3 expired due to sepsis 1 mo after diagnosis.Treatment with steroids with or without hydroxyurea gave good response in all 3 cases. Hence, they still remain the gold standard for the treatment of IHES in children.\n",
      "KLF1 is an erythroid specific transcription factor that is involved in erythroid lineage commitment, globin switching and terminal red blood cell maturation. Various mutations of KLF1 have been identified in humans, which have led to both benign and pathological phenotypes. The E325K mutation, within the second zinc finger of the KLF1 gene, has been shown to cause a new form of congenital dyserythropoietic anemia (CDA) now labeled as CDA type IV. We report the fourth documented case of this mutation, and propose a clinical diagnostic model to better identify this disease in other patients. Our patient is a Taiwanese child who presented to us at 8years of age with severe hemolytic anemia, splenomegaly, elevated fetal hemoglobin (HbF), iron overload, and dyserythropoiesis in the bone marrow. KLF1 sequence analysis revealed a G-to-A transition in one allele of exon 3, which resulted in the substitution of a glutamate 325 by a lysine. Flow cytometry analysis revealed decreased protein expression of CD44 on the red blood cells, and decreased red blood cell deformability as measured using an ektacytometer. Blood typing revealed his red blood cells to be Co(a-b-), In(b-), LW(ab-) and Lu(b+), even though DNA testing predicted that he would be Co(a+b-) and LW(a+b-). This newly discovered CDA combines features of a hemoglobinopathy, RBC membrane defect and hereditary persistence of HbF (HPFH) which are not seen in the previous types of CDA. Increased awareness of this phenotype may improve the more prompt and accurate diagnosis of these patients.\n",
      "Gamma-glutamyl carboxylase (GGCX) mutations have been reported in patients with a pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE)-like phenotype, loose redundant skin, and multiple vitamin K-dependent coagulation factor deficiencies. We report on the clinical findings and molecular results in 13 affected members of two families who had a uniform phenotype consisting of (PXE)-like skin manifestations in the neck and trunk, loose sagging skin of the trunk and upper limbs, and retinitis pigmentosa confirmed by electroretinographies in 10 affected individuals. There were no coagulation abnormalities. Molecular investigations of the ATP-binding cassette subfamily C member 6 did not yield causative mutations. All 13 affected family members were found to be homozygous for the splice-site mutation c.373+3G>T in the GGCX gene. All tested parents were heterozygous for the mutation, and healthy siblings were either heterozygous or had the wild type. We suggest that the present patients represent a hitherto unreported phenotype associated with GGCX mutations. Digenic inheritance has been suggested to explain the variability in phenotype in GGCX mutation carriers. Consequently, the present phenotype may not be explained only by the GGCX mutations only but may be influenced by variants in other genes or epigenetic and environmental factors.\n",
      "A 21-year-old woman presented to the Charles C. Harris Skin and Cancer Pavilion with a life-long history of palmoplantar keratoderma that was accompanied by episodic flares of polycyclic psoriasiform patches diffusely over the rest of her body. A biopsy specimen of a representative skin lesion showed epidermolytic hyperkeratosis. The particular phenotype that this patient exhibited has been reported in only seven families previously in the literature. Mutations in keratin 1 and 10 have been identified in these patients and are similar to those mutations in patients with classic epidermolytic hyperkeratosis.\n",

      "An Afrikaner kindred in South Africa had a dominantly inherited skeletal dysplasia-blindness-deafness syndrome. The affected individuals had reduced stature and a round, flattened facies. The bone changes resembled multiple epiphyseal dysplasia with additional minor abnormalities in the phalanges, femoral heads and spine. Progressive myopia, retinal thinning and crenated cataracts led to visual disturbance, while conductive deafness represented the third component of the triad. The syndromic significance of associated asteroid hyalosis is uncertain.\n",
      "The chromosome 17q21.31 deletion syndrome is a genomic disorder characterized by highly distinctive facial features, moderate-to-severe intellectual disability, hypotonia and friendly behavior. Here, we show that de novo loss-of-function mutations in KANSL1 (also called KIAA1267) cause a full del(17q21.31) phenotype in two unrelated individuals that lack deletion at 17q21.31. These findings indicate that 17q21.31 deletion syndrome is a monogenic disorder caused by haploinsufficiency of KANSL1.\n",
      "We report on two patients with developmental delay, hypotonia, and autistic features associated with duplications of chromosome region 2q23.1-2q23.2 detected by chromosome microarray analysis. The duplications include one OMIM Morbid Map gene, MBD5, as well as seven known RefSeq genes (ACVR2A, ORC4L, EPC2, KIF5C, MIR1978, LYPD6B, and LYPD6). MBD5 lies in the minimum area of overlap of the 2q23.1 microdeletion syndrome. This report provides the first detailed clinical examination of two individuals with a duplication of this region and suggests that brain development and cognitive function may be affected by an increased dosage of the genes involved.\n",
      "In a female infant with dysmorphic features, severe neurological defects, and congenital blindness, a positive urinary Bratton-Marshall test led to identification of a massive excretion of 5-amino-4-imidazolecarboxamide (AICA)-riboside, the dephosphorylated counterpart of AICAR (also termed \"ZMP\"), an intermediate of de novo purine biosynthesis. ZMP and its di- and triphosphate accumulated in the patient's erythrocytes. Incubation of her fibroblasts with AICA-riboside led to accumulation of AICAR, not observed in control cells, suggesting impairment of the final steps of purine biosynthesis, catalyzed by the bifunctional enzyme AICAR transformylase/IMP cyclohydrolase (ATIC). AICAR transformylase was profoundly deficient, whereas the IMP cyclohydrolase level was 40% of normal. Sequencing of ATIC showed a K426R change in the transformylase region in one allele and a frameshift in the other. Recombinant protein carrying mutation K426R completely lacks AICAR transformylase activity.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Transporters, ion pumps, and ion channels are membrane proteins that regulate selective permeability and maintain ionic gradients across cell membranes. Mutations in CACNA1A encoding a neuronal calcium channel and ATP1A2 encoding an ion pump cause episodic ataxia, hemiplegic migraine, and seizures. Mutant gene products of both CACNA1A and ATP1A2 may affect neurotransmission of glutamate, the most abundant excitatory amino acid neurotransmitter. METHODS: We examined our patient population with episodic ataxia and hemiplegic migraine but with no mutation in either CACNA1A or ATP1A2. We looked for mutations in SLC1A3, which encodes the glutamate transporter excitatory amino acid transporter (EAAT) 1 that is important in removing glutamate from the synaptic cleft. RESULTS: A patient with episodic ataxia, seizures, migraine, and alternating hemiplegia has a heterozygous mutation in SLC1A3 that is not present in his asymptomatic parents and controls. Expression studies of the mutant EAAT1 showed decreased expression of the protein with a markedly reduced capacity for glutamate uptake. When coexpressed, the mutant EAAT1 decreased the activity of wild-type EAAT1 but not of two other transporters EAAT2 or EAAT3, suggesting that mutant EAAT1 specifically multimerizes with wild-type EAAT1 to exert its dominant negative effect. CONCLUSION: Our data show that a heterozygous mutation in EAAT1 can lead to decreased glutamate uptake, which can contribute to neuronal hyperexcitability to cause seizures, hemiplegia, and episodic ataxia.\n",
      "We identified a two-branch consanguineous family in which four affected members (three females and one male) presented with constitutive growth delay, severe psychomotor retardation, microcephaly, cerebellar hypoplasia, and second-degree heart block. They also shared distinct facial features and similar appearance of their hands and feet. Childhood-onset insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus developed in one affected child around the age of 9 years. Molecular analysis excluded mutations in potentially related genes such as PTF1A, EIF2AK3, EOMES, and WDR62. This condition appears to be unique of other known conditions, suggesting a unique clinical entity of autosomal recessive mode of inheritance.\n",
      "Combined immunodeficiency (SCID) can be isolated and involve the immune system only or associated with abnormalities affecting other organs, mainly the skeletal and neurological systems. We report on sisters, born to consanguineous parents, with CID, facial dysmorphism, developmental delay, optic atrophy, myoclonic seizures, and skeletal anomalies. To the best of our knowledge, this is a hitherto new syndrome with most probably autosomal recessive inheritance and unknown etiology.\n",
      "We described another previously apparently unreported form of acrofacial dysostosis (AFD) from Sicily, residing, coincidentally in the same small village as that with the recently delineated Catania AFD. In contra-distinction to the latter, the 4 patients with the Palagonia form of AFD are of normal intelligence, and instead of extensive caries have oligodontia (4), short stature (3), frizzy hair (pili torti) with aplasia cutis verticis (1), mild cutaneous syndactyly of digits 2-5 (4), attenuation of the 4th metacarpals (3/3), unilaterally cleft lip (1), and some vertebral anomalies such as a large atlas (1), mild scoliosis (1), small odontoid process, spina bifida occulta at S1 (1). Casually, this would appear to be an iceberg dominant disorder, with the proposita most severely affected. This could be an X-linked dominant, but more likely an autosomal dominant trait.\n",
      "A sporadic case of hearing loss with ataxia, clinically suggesting Lichtenstein-Knorr disease, is described. Magnetic Resonance (MR) shows an involvement of the white matter, which appears diffusely reduced and abnormal, together with a peculiar tickening of the grey matter.

      "We report on a 2-year-old boy with Juberg-Marsidi syndrome. He has mental retardation, short stature, micropenis, cryptorchidism, and minor facial abnormalities. His Leydig cells responded to the administration of human chorionic gonadotropin and there were positive responses of LH and FSH to the administration of LH-RH. He showed normal weight gain and head circumference which have not been described previously. The association of Juberg-Marsidi syndrome with HbH disease was ruled out in the propositus.\n",
      "We describe a family with two half-brothers affected with severe mental retardation. The phenotype in the affected individuals is characterized by apparent acromegaly, profound mental retardation, and hyperactivity. The mother has analogous but less severe facial anomalies and mild mental impairment. Screening for fra(X) (q) was negative in peripheral lymphocytes using methotrexate for fra(X) enhancement. The clinical findings in our patients are similar to those described by Fryns et al. [1986] in two patients with acquired lesions of the central nervous system. CT investigations in one of our patients showed areas of hyperdensity in the pontine region and a small subarachnoid cyst. The pedigree suggests X-linked inheritance. The association of apparent acromegaly, CNS anomalies, megalotestes, and mental retardation in this family supports the hypothesis that a distinct syndrome may exist with phenotype anomalies more severe than those characteristic for the Martin-Bell syndrome but without fragile X.\n",
      "Immunodysregulation, Polyendocrinopathy, Enteropathy, X-linked (IPEX) syndrome is a rare, X-linked recessive disease that affects regulatory T cells (Tregs) resulting in diarrhea, enteropathy, eczema, and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. IPEX syndrome is caused by pathogenic alterations in FOXP3 located at Xp11.23. FOXP3 encodes a transcription factor that interacts with several partners, including NFAT and NF-√é¬∫B, and is necessary for the proper cellular differentiation of Tregs. Although variable, the vast majority of IPEX syndrome patients have onset of disease during infancy with severe enteropathy. Only five families with prenatal presentation of IPEX syndrome have been reported. Here, we present two additional prenatal onset cases with novel inherited frameshift pathogenic variants in FOXP3 that generate premature stop codons. Ultrasound findings in the first patient identified echogenic bowel, echogenic debris, scalp edema, and hydrops. In the second patient, ultrasound findings included polyhydramnios with echogenic debris, prominent fluid-filled loops of bowel, and echogenic bowel. These cases further broaden the phenotypic spectrum of IPEX syndrome by describing previously unappreciated prenatal ultrasound findings associated with the disease.\n",
      "We report on a full-term male infant with hypoplastic male genitalia and bilateral impalpable testes noted at birth, who over the following months developed increasing hypotonia, apneic episodes, and seizures resulting in his death at age 24 weeks. During this period regression of penile corporeal tissue was observed. An endocrinological diagnosis of primary hypogonadism was made and cerebral imaging at 19 weeks showed reduced periventricular white matter with marked pontocerebellar hypoplasia (PCH)/atrophy, but a well-developed posterior fossa. We propose that this condition constitutes a new form of severe PCH/atrophy with testicular regression that has onset in the fetal period.\n",
      "A family pedigree with a possible new genetic syndrome characterised by the presence of angiomas, systemic in nature, affecting particularly the skin and the central nervous system, is described. Angiomas of the CNS seem to have a marked tendency to bleed. The condition shows a clearly dominant mode of transmission, four subjects in three generations being affected. Differentiation from other conditions belonging to the vascular abnormalities subgroup of phakomatoses is presented.\n",
      "Malonyl-CoA decarboxylase deficiency (MLYCD) is a rare autosomal recessive inborn error of metabolism presenting a variable clinical phenotype. We report an affected Italian male receiving an early diagnosis (8days after birth) and a timely dietary therapy (high carbohydrate, low long chain fatty acid and medium chain triglyceride supplemented diet with l-carnitine supplementation). The boy was born at term and presented normal function of the heart (except for a tricuspid Ebstein-like dysplasia) and neurodevelopmental status. Genomic sequencing of MLYCD gene revealed two point mutations (c.672G>A, c.869C>T) not listed in the Human MLYCD Allelic Variant Database nor in Human Gene Mutation Database, responsible for a deleterious effect on protein structure and function according to a computational analysis (MuPro, SIFT, ConSEQ v1.1). At the age of 2years he only showed a mild language and psychomotor delay, while heart functioning became normal. Brain MRI examination was normal. Thirty-five cases, including our patient, have been described to date. This is the first report concerning a malonic aciduria patient diagnosed on newborn screening and treated in a presymptomatic stage of the disease.\n",
      "Decreased serine levels were found in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of a boy with pre- and postnatal growth retardation, moderate psychomotor retardation, and facial dysmorphism suggestive of Williams syndrome. Fluorescence in situ hybridisation with an elastin gene probe indicated the presence of a submicroscopic 7q11.23 deletion, confirming this diagnosis. Further investigation showed that the phosphoserine phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.3.) activity in lymphoblasts and fibroblasts amounted to about 25% of normal values. Oral serine normalised the plasma and CSF levels of this amino acid and seemed to have some clinical effect. These data suggest that the elastin gene and the phosphoserine phosphatase gene might be closely linked. This seems to be the first report of phosphoserine phosphatase deficiency.\n",
      "16q24 deletion involving the ANKRD11 gene, ranging from 137‚Äâkb to 2‚ÄâMb, have been associated with a microdeletion syndrome characterized by variable cognitive impairment, autism spectrum disorder, facial dysmorphisms with dental anomalies, brain abnormalities essentially affecting the corpus callosum and short stature. On the other hand, patients carrying either deletions encompassing solely ANKRD11 or its loss-of-function variants were reported in association with the KBG syndrome, characterized by a very similar phenotype, including mild-to-moderate intellectual disability, short stature and macrodontia of upper incisors, with inter and intrafamilial variability. To assess whether the haploinsufficiency of ANKRD11-flanking genes, such as ZFPM1, CDH15 and ZNF778, contributed to either the severity of the neurological impairment or was associated with other clinical features, we collected 12 new cases with a 16q24.2q24.3 deletion (de novo in 11 cases), ranging from 343‚Äâkb to 2.3‚ÄâMb. In 11 of them, the deletion involved the ANKRD11 gene, whereas in 1 case only flanking genes upstream to it were deleted. By comparing the clinical and genetic features of our patients with those previously reported, we show that the severity of the neurological phenotype and the frequency of congenital heart defects characterize the deletions that, besides ANKRD11, contain ZFPM1, CDH15 and ZNF778 as well. Moreover, the presence of thrombocytopenia and astigmatism should be taken into account to distinguish between 16q24 microdeletion syndrome and KBG syndrome. The single patient not deleted for ANKRD11, whose phenotype is characterized by milder psychomotor delay, cardiac congenital malformation, thrombocytopenia and astigmatism, confirms all this data.\n",
      "In 2005, we reported on a family as having Fr√≠as syndrome (OMIM: 609640), with four affected members displaying a pattern of congenital defects nearly identical to those observed in a mother and son described by Frias [Fr√≠as et al. (1975). Birth Defects Orig Artic Ser 11:30-33]. These defects included growth deficiency, facial anomalies, and hand and foot alterations. We had the opportunity to study this family again due to the birth of another affected girl, who presented with similar facial characteristics to those of her elder half-sister and the rest of affected relatives, which consisted of mild exophthalmia, bilateral palpebral ptosis, downslanting palpebral fissures, and hypertelorism. We performed array-CGH, which identified an identical interstitial deletion of chromosome 14q22.1-q22.3 in the mother and two daughters. The deletion is 4.06‚ÄâMb in length and includes the BMP4 gene, a member of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) family of secreted proteins. A review of the literature showed that deletions or mutations of this gene underlie congenital defects affecting brain, eye, teeth, and digit development. Although the clinical manifestations of the current family correlate with the defects observed in patients having either 14q22-q23 deletions or mutations of BMP4, they show a milder phenotype. In order to understand the clinical variability, we evaluated the already known functional characteristics of the BMP gene members. This gene family plays an important role during early embryogenesis, and the complex synergistic functions and redundancies of the BMPs led us to conclude that haploinsufficiency of BMP4 is likely to be responsible for the clinical expression of Fr√≠as syndrome.\n",
      "Cystinosis is a rare autosomal recessive disorder due to impaired transport of cystine out of cellular lysosomes. Its estimated incidence is 1 in 100,000 live births. End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is the most prominent feature of cystinosis and, along with dehydration and electrolyte imbalance due to renal tubular Fanconi syndrome, has accounted for the bulk of deaths from this disorder. Prior to renal transplantation and cystine-depleting therapy with cysteamine for children with nephropathic cystinosis, their lifespan was approximately 10 years. Now, cystinotic patients have survived through their fifth decade, but the unremitting accumulation of cystine has created significant non-renal morbidity and mortality. In this article we review the classic presentation of nephropathic cystinosis and the natural history, diagnosis, and treatment of the disorder's systemic involvement. We also emphasize the role of oral cysteamine therapy in preventing the late complications of cystinosis.\n",
      "Inherited dental malformations constitute a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of disorders. Here, we report on a severe developmental dental defect that results in a dentin dysplasia phenotype with major microdontia, oligodontia, and shape abnormalities in a highly consanguineous family. Homozygosity mapping revealed a unique zone on 6q27-ter. The two affected children were found to¬†carry a homozygous mutation in SMOC2. Knockdown of smoc2 in zebrafish showed pharyngeal teeth that had abnormalities reminiscent of the human phenotype. Moreover, smoc2 depletion in zebrafish affected the expression of three major odontogenesis genes: dlx2, bmp2, and pitx2.\n",
      "A new ectodermal dysplasia syndrome was reported by Bork et al. in 1987 (Hautarzt 38:342-347). The syndrome consisted of hypotrichosis with the typical SEM (scanning electron microscopy) changes of uncombable hair, retinal pigmentary dystrophy, juvenile cataract, oligodontia, brachydactyly with brachymetacarpia; it was inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. We describe a sporadic case and add further clinical findings to expand the spectrum of this rare syndrome.\n",
      "We report on two sisters born to normal but consanguineous parents, with the unusual combination of spinocerebellar degeneration and corneal dystrophy. Their manifestations include mental subnormality, bilateral corneal opacification starting in the second year of life and leading to severe visual impairment, and slowly progressive cerebellar abnormalities with variable dorsal column and upper motor neuron involvement. A third sister had only minor spinocerebellar signs but no eye findings, and three other sibs were completely normal. Both affected sisters underwent penetrating keratoplasty and their vision improved. Histologic examination showed findings of corneal dystrophy including corneal edema, thickening of Descemet membrane, and degenerative pannus. High-resolution light and electron microscopy of muscle and sural nerve performed on both patients was abnormal. It is suggested that, in this family, the corneal dystrophy and spinocerebellar degeneration are pleiotropic manifestations of an autosomal-recessive disorder.\n",
      "Eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (EMS) is characterized by subacute onset of myalgias and peripheral eosinophilia, followed by chronic neuropathy and skin induration. An epidemic of EMS in 1989 was linked to consumption of L-tryptophan that had originated from a single source. Following the ban by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on the sale of L-tryptophan, the incidence of EMS declined rapidly. Moreover, no new cases have been described since the FDA ban was lifted in 2005. We report the clinical, histopathologic, and immunogenetic features of a new case of L-tryptophan-associated EMS, along with evidence of activated transforming growth factor √é¬≤ and interleukin-4 signaling in the lesional skin.\n",
      "We report on a 22-day-old Tunisian boy born to consanguineous (first-cousin) parents (F = 1/16). The patient presents wide forehead with frontal encephalocele, wide anterior fontanel, marked hypertelorism, coloboma of the upper lids, proptosis, congenital glaucoma, broad nose, syndactyly between fingers 3 and 4, hypoplastic 3rd, 4th and 5th toes with nail dysplasia, hypospadias with cleft glans, bifid scrotum. Brain MRI showed right frontal encephalocele with anomalies of the cortical gyration without any corpus callosum abnormality. Normal chromosomes and parents' consanguinity are suggestive of autosomal recessive inheritance. Facial midline anomalies associated with limb and genitourinary anomalies is very uncommon. We present the third case reported in the literature.\n",
      "Clinical whole-exome sequencing (WES) for identification of mutations leading to Mendelian disease has been offered to the medical community since 2011. Clinically undiagnosed neurological disorders are the most frequent basis for test referral, and currently, approximately 25% of such cases are diagnosed at the molecular level. To date, there are approximately 4,000 \"known\" disease-associated loci, and many are associated with striking dysmorphic features, making genotype-phenotype correlations relatively straightforward. A significant fraction of cases, however, lack characteristic dysmorphism or clinical pathognomonic traits and are dependent upon molecular tests for definitive diagnoses. Further, many molecular diagnoses are guided by recent gene-disease association discoveries. Hence, there is a critical interplay between clinical testing and research leading to gene-disease association discovery. Here, we describe four probands, all of whom presented with hypotonia, intellectual disability, global developmental delay, and mildly dysmorphic facial features. Three of the four also had sleep apnea. Each was a simplex case without a remarkable family history. Using WES, we identified AHDC1 de novo truncating mutations that most likely cause this genetic syndrome.\n",
      "The dystroglycanopathies comprise a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of muscular dystrophies characterized by deficient glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan. Mutations in the fukutin (FKTN) gene have primarily been identified among patients with classic Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy (FCMD), a severe form of dystroglycanopathy characterized by CMD, cobblestone lissencephaly and ocular defects. We describe two brothers of Caucasian and Japanese ancestry with normal intelligence and limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) due to compound heterozygous FKTN mutations. Muscle biopsy showed a dystrophy with selectively reduced alpha-dystroglycan glycoepitope immunostaining. Immunoblots revealed hypoglycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan and loss of laminin binding. FKTN gene sequencing identified two variants: c.340G>A and c.527T>C, predicting missense mutations p.A114T and p.F176S, respectively. Our results provide further evidence for ethnic and allelic heterogeneity and the presence of milder phenotypes in FKTN-dystroglycanopathy despite a substantial degree of alpha-dystroglycan hypoglycosylation in skeletal muscle.\n",
      "The link between autoimmune diseases and primary immunodeficiency syndromes has been increasingly appreciated. Immunologic evaluation of a young man with autoimmune enterocolopathy and unexplained infections revealed evidence of immunodeficiency, including IgG subclass deficiency, impaired Ag-induced lymphocyte proliferation, reduced cytokine production by CD8(+) T lymphocytes, and decreased numbers of NK cells. Genetic evaluation identified haploinsufficiency of NFAT5, a transcription factor regulating immune cell function and cellular adaptation to hyperosmotic stress, as a possible cause of this syndrome. Inhibition or deletion of NFAT5 in normal human and murine cells recapitulated several of the immune deficits identified in the patient. These results provide evidence of a primary immunodeficiency disorder associated with organ-specific autoimmunity linked to NFAT5 deficiency.\n",
      "The association of cloverleaf skull and micromelia is reputed. X-ray images of the skull are typical; those of the skeleton are compatible with the thoracic dysplasia reported by Jeune, or with chondro-ectodermic dysplasia: short ribs, horizontal roof of the acetabulum with a rounded median prominence and lateral spurs, deformed long bones with broad metaphyses, absent ossification of the terminal phalanges. The mode of inheritance of the syndrome is probably autosomal recessive. The association reported is undescribed until now, although cloverleaf skull can be associated with other bone deformities. Most often the latter are thanatophoric dwarfism or a syndrome including ankylosis of the elbow joints, occasionally of the knees, club-foot, syndactyly and absent phalanges.\n",
      "Mitochondrial disorders are clinically and genetically diverse, with mutations in mitochondrial or nuclear genes able to cause defects in mitochondrial gene expression. Recently, mutations in several genes encoding factors involved in mt-tRNA processing have been identified to cause mitochondrial disease. Using whole-exome sequencing, we identified mutations in TRMT10C (encoding the mitochondrial RNase P protein 1 [MRPP1]) in two unrelated individuals who presented at birth with lactic acidosis, hypotonia, feeding difficulties, and deafness. Both individuals died at 5¬†months after respiratory failure. MRPP1, along with MRPP2 and MRPP3, form the mitochondrial ribonuclease P (mt-RNase P) complex that cleaves the 5' ends of mt-tRNAs from polycistronic precursor transcripts. Additionally, a stable complex of MRPP1 and MRPP2 has m(1)R9 methyltransferase activity, which methylates mt-tRNAs at position 9 and is vital for folding mt-tRNAs into their correct tertiary structures. Analyses of fibroblasts from affected individuals harboring TRMT10C missense variants revealed decreased protein levels of MRPP1 and an increase in mt-RNA precursors indicative of impaired mt-RNA processing and defective mitochondrial protein synthesis. The pathogenicity of the detected variants-compound heterozygous c.542G>T (p.Arg181Leu) and c.814A>G (p.Thr272Ala) changes in subject 1 and a homozygous c.542G>T (p.Arg181Leu) variant in subject 2-was validated by the functional rescue of mt-RNA processing and mitochondrial protein synthesis defects after lentiviral transduction of wild-type TRMT10C. Our study suggests that these variants affect MRPP1 protein stability and mt-tRNA processing without affecting m(1)R9 methyltransferase activity, identifying mutations in TRMT10C as a cause of mitochondrial disease and highlighting the importance of RNA processing for correct mitochondrial function.\n",
      "We report on three Aboriginal Australian siblings with a unique phenotype which overlaps with known megalencephaly syndromes and RASopathies, including Costello syndrome. A gain-of-function mutation in MTOR was identified and represents the first reported human condition due to a germline, familial MTOR mutation. We describe the findings in this family to highlight that (i) the path to determination of pathogenicity was confounded by the lack of genomic reference data for Australian Aboriginals and that (ii) the disease biology, functional analyses in this family, and studies on the tuberous sclerosis complex support consideration of an mTOR inhibitor as a therapeutic agent.\n",
      "SCALP syndrome is an acronym describing the coincidence of sebaceous nevus syndrome, central nervous system malformations, aplasia cutis congenita, limbal dermoid, and pigmented nevus (giant congenital melanocytic nevus). We present a fourth case of this syndrome.\n",
      "A family is presented with short stature, femoral epiphyseal dysplasia, mild vertebral changes, and sensorineural deafness inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. Myopia and retinal detachment presenting in adult life were also present in some affected members. We suggest that this disorder may be a distinct entity within the spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia group of disorders.\n",
      "Microcephaly with simplified gyration, epilepsy and permanent neonatal diabetes syndrome (MEDS) is a recently described, autosomal recessive-inherited syndrome. We report the case of an infant presenting with lethargy at age five weeks and clinical findings of persistent hyperglycaemia and microcephaly with simplified gyration, suggestive of MEDS. The diagnosis was confirmed by the detection of a known c.233¬†T¬†>¬†C mutation in the IER3IP1 gene. Only eight cases of MEDS have been reported in the literature. We reviewed these with the aim of better delineating their clinical manifestations, which should allow earlier and more accurate diagnosis and genetic counseling.\n",
      "We present a male-female sib pair born to Ashkenazi Jewish parents with \"arthrogryposis,\" hypotonia-hypokinesia sequence and lymphedema. Of all the \"arthrogryposis\" hypotonia syndromes, the condition in these sibs appears to be most like that of the patients of German et al [1975] and the patient of Salmon [1978]. They appear to be the first sib pair with German syndrome, which suggests autosomal recessive inheritance. Three of the four known families with affected children have been Ashkenazi Jews.\n",
      "In this report, we describe the first known patient with a deficiency of sterol carrier protein X (SCPx), a peroxisomal enzyme with thiolase activity, which is required for the breakdown of branched-chain fatty acids. The patient presented with torticollis and dystonic head tremor as well as slight cerebellar signs with intention tremor, nystagmus, hyposmia, and azoospermia. Magnetic resonance imaging showed leukencephalopathy and involvement of the thalamus and pons. Metabolite analyses of plasma revealed an accumulation of the branched-chain fatty acid pristanic acid, and abnormal bile alcohol glucuronides were excreted in urine. In cultured skin fibroblasts, the thiolytic activity of SCPx was deficient, and no SCPx protein could be detected by western blotting. Mutation analysis revealed a homozygous 1-nucleotide insertion, 545_546insA, leading to a frameshift and premature stop codon (I184fsX7).\n",
      "Two brothers with hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia were found to have urticaria pigmentosa-like skin pigmentation with increased mast cells and melanin depositions in the dermis. Structural ciliary abnormalities of the respiratory tract were seen, and these may contribute to their severe recurrent chest infections. Primary hypothyroidism occurred in both by 3 years of age and responded to replacement therapy. The abnormalities seen appear to be the result of a common genetic aberration causing a particular sequence of maldevelopments during embryogenesis. This form of hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia associated with hypothyroidism gives a unique insight into the potential extent of structural defects of ectodermal dysplasias.\n",
      "We report on a family in whom the combination of mental retardation (MR), anterior maxillary protrusion, and strabismus segregates. The healthy, consanguineous parents (first cousins) of Israeli-Arab descent had 11 children, 7 of whom (5 girls) were affected. They all had severe MR. Six of the seven had anterior maxillary protrusion with vertical maxillary excess, open bite, and prominent crowded teeth. None of the sibs with normal intelligence had jaw or dental anomalies. The child with MR but without a jaw anomaly was somewhat less severely retarded, had seizures and severe psychosis, which may point to his having a separate disorder. Biochemical and neurological studies, including brain MRI and standard cytogenetic studies, yielded normal results; fragile X was excluded, no subtelomeric rearrangements were detectable, and X-inactivation studies in the mother showed random inactivation. We have been unable to find a similar disorder in the literature, and suggest that this is a hitherto unreported autosomal recessive disorder, which we propose to name MRAMS (mental retardation, anterior maxillary protrusion, and strabismus).\n",
      "PURPOSE:Recurrent 15q13.3 deletions are enriched in multiple neurodevelopmental conditions including intellectual disability, autism, epilepsy, and schizophrenia. However, the 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome remains ill-defined. METHODS:We systematically compiled all cases of 15q13.3 deletion published before 2014. We also examined three locally available cohorts to identify new adults with 15q13.3 deletions. RESULTS:We identified a total of 246 cases (133 children, 113 adults) with deletions overlapping or within the 15q13.3 (breakpoint (BP)4-BP5) region, including seven novel adult cases from local cohorts. No BP4-BP5 deletions were identified in 23,838 adult controls. Where known, 15q13.3 deletions were typically inherited (85.4%) and disproportionately of maternal origin (P < 0.0001). Overall, 198 cases (121 children, 77 adults; 80.5%) had at least one neuropsychiatric diagnosis. Accounting for ascertainment, developmental disability/intellectual disability was present in 57.7%, epilepsy/seizures in 28.0%, speech problems in 15.9%, autism spectrum disorder in 10.9%, schizophrenia in 10.2%, mood disorder in 10.2%, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in 6.5%. By contrast, major congenital malformations, including congenital heart disease (2.4%), were uncommon. Placenta previa occurred in the pregnancies of four cases. CONCLUSION:The 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome is predominantly characterized by neuropsychiatric expression. There are implications for pre- and postnatal detection, genetic counseling, and anticipatory care.\n",
      "A neurocutaneous syndrome is described in which spastic paraplegia, peroneal neuropathy, and crural hypopigmentation are inherited in a dominant pattern. Spastic paraplegia becomes clinically apparent during adolescence or in childhood and progresses slowly throughout the adult years with a variability in severity of expression. Peroneal neuropathy is documented clinically and by slowing on nerve conduction studies. Pattern-reversal visual evoked potentials also yield a delayed response, but brainstem auditory evoked potentials and somatosensory evoked potentials in upper and lower extremities are normal. Crural hypopigmentation is present in each neurologically affected family member. Although the pattern may vary, a pretibial distribution predominates. The lower-extremity abnormalities of the central and peripheral nervous system and neural crest cell derivatives may share a common relationship, but the abnormal visual evoked potentials suggest a more generalized involvement. This family may represent a transition form between familial spastic paraplegia and the spinocerebellar degenerations.\n",
      "We recently delineated a novel disorder characterized by hypotrichosis, nail dystrophy and sensorineural deafness and caused by a missense mutation in GJB2 (connexin26). The patient, a girl, was two years old when we first saw her. We had the opportunity to re-examine her at four years of age and found that the phenotype had changed appreciably. The hypotrichosis was less pronounced, but the nail dystrophy had worsened. Intriguingly, the phenotype now included a mucositis and skin lesions identical to those found in erythrokeratodermia variabilis. There is now a considerable overlap with other gap junction disorders and we propose that some cases of erythrokeratodermia variabilis without mutations in either GJB3 or GJB4 but with deafness may be caused by mutations in GJB2. This is the first description of the evolution of a gap junction disease over time and we note that follow-up of patients suffering from gap junction skin disorders is necessary to fully delineate the phenotypes caused by mutations in gap junction genes.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: The Conserved Oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex is involved in the retrograde trafficking of Golgi components, thereby affecting the localization of Golgi glycosyltransferases. Deficiency of a COG-subunit leads to defective protein glycosylation, and thus Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation (CDG). Mutations in subunits 1, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 have been associated with CDG-II. The first patient with COG5-CDG was recently described (Paesold-Burda et al. Hum Mol Genet 2009; 18:4350-6). Contrary to most other COG-CDG cases, the patient presented a mild/moderate phenotype, i.e. moderate psychomotor retardation with language delay, truncal ataxia and slight hypotonia. METHODS: CDG-IIx patients from our database were screened for mutations in COG5. Clinical data were compared. Brefeldin A treatment of fibroblasts and immunoblotting experiments were performed to support the diagnosis. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: We identified five new patients with proven COG5 deficiency. We conclude that the clinical picture is not always as mild as previously described. It rather comprises a broad spectrum with phenotypes ranging from mild to very severe. Interestingly, on a clinical basis some of the patients present a significant overlap with COG7-CDG, a finding which can probably be explained by subunit interactions at the protein level.\n",
      "Oblique facial clefts are rare and include types 2-6 of Tessier's classification. Here we report on 4 patients with oblique facial clefts and a strikingly similar facial appearance. The pattern of facial involvement, the presence of consanguinity in 3 of them, as well as the entire clinical picture, suggest a unique dysmorphogenetic process which could represent, in some instances, an oculomaxillofacial dysostosis.\n",
      "Two Mexican families in which a total of 17 persons exhibited the same pattern of limb malformations are described. The syndrome is characterized by triphalangeal thumbs and brachydactyly affecting the index fingers and the third toes. The clinical findings are variable and the inheritance is autosomal dominant. The syndrome, to the best of our knowledge, has not been described before.\n",
      "We report on two brothers, their mother, and 18 other relatives of five generations presenting an apparent newly recognized syndrome involving natal teeth, trichodystrophy, prominent interdigital folds, simian-like hands with transverse palmar creases, and ungual digital dystrophy, inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. In addition, the patients had hypoplasia of the first metacarpal and metatarsal bones and distal phalanges of the toes.\n",
      "Dehydrated hereditary stomatocytosis (DHS) is a rare genetic disorder of red cell permeability to cations, leading to a well-compensated hemolytic anemia. DHS was shown previously to be associated in some families with a particular form of perinatal edema, which resolves in the weeks following birth and, in addition, with pseudohyperkalemia in one kindred. The latter condition was hitherto regarded as the separate entity, \"familial pseudohyperkalemia.\" DHS and familial pseudohyperkalemia are thought to stem from the same gene, mapping to 16q23-q24. This study screened 8 French and 2 American families with DHS. DHS appeared to be part of a pleiotropic syndrome in some families: DHS + perinatal edema, DHS + pseudohyperkalemia, or DHS + perinatal edema + pseudohyperkalemia. If adequately attended to, the perinatal edema resolved spontaneously after birth. Logistic regression showed that increased mean corpuscular volume and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration were the parameters best related to DHS. In patients in whom cation fluxes were investigated, the temperature dependence of the monovalent cation leak exhibited comparable curves. Specific recombination events consistently suggested that the responsible gene lies between markers D16S402 and D16S3037 (16q23-q24). The 95% confidence limits (Z(max) >/= 3.02) spanned almost the complete 9-cM interval between these 2 markers.\n",
      "Most pedigrees of Aarskog's faciodigitogenital syndrome have suggested X linked inheritance. However, sex influenced autosomal dominant inheritance is also a possibility in some families. We describe an Arab family of normal consanguineous parents with five children (three males and two females) with some features of Aarskog syndrome in addition to some unusual hair changes. The possibility that this family represents a distinct previously unrecognised faciodigitogenital syndrome with short stature and hair abnormalities is suggested and discussed.\n",
      "Microphthalmia with linear skin lesions (MLS) is an X-linked dominant male-lethal disorder associated with mutations in holocytochrome c-type synthase (HCCS), which encodes a crucial player of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC). Unlike other mitochondrial diseases, MLS is characterized by a well-recognizable neurodevelopmental phenotype. Interestingly, not all clinically diagnosed MLS cases have mutations in HCCS, thus suggesting genetic heterogeneity for this disorder. Among the possible candidates, we analyzed the X-linked COX7B and found deleterious de novo mutations in two simplex cases and a nonsense mutation, which segregates with the disease, in a familial case. COX7B encodes a poorly characterized structural subunit of cytochrome c oxidase (COX), the MRC complex IV. We demonstrated that COX7B is indispensable for COX assembly, COX activity, and mitochondrial respiration. Downregulation of√Ç¬†the COX7B ortholog (cox7B) in medaka (Oryzias latipes) resulted in microcephaly and microphthalmia that recapitulated the MLS phenotype and demonstrated an essential function of complex IV activity in vertebrate CNS development. Our results indicate an evolutionary conserved role of the MRC complexes III and IV for the proper development of the CNS in vertebrates and uncover a group of mitochondrial diseases hallmarked by a developmental phenotype.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: Distal hereditary motor neuropathies (dHMN) form a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of disorders, characterized by muscle weakness and atrophy predominating at the distal part of the limbs, due to the progressive degeneration of motor neurons in the spinal cord. We report here a novel rare variant of dHMN with autosomal recessive inheritance in a large Jewish family originating from Morocco. The disease is characterized by a predominance of paralysis at the lower limbs and an early adulthood onset. We performed a genetic study in this family to identify and characterized the causing mutation. METHODS: Homozygosity mapping strategy and sequencing of the candidate genes were performed. Expression studies were made on patient fibroblasts. Functional experiments were performed on a cellular model of motor neuron disease. RESULTS: We mapped the disease to the 2q34-q36.1 chromosomal region and identified a homozygous splice mutation in the gene HSJ1 (DNAJB2) decreasing the expression of the 2 main isoforms HSJ1a and HSJ1b. Overexpression of both HSJ1a and HSJ1b reduced inclusion formation induced by the mutated SOD1-A4V in a neuronal cellular model. INTERPRETATION: HSJ1 is a neuronal enriched member of the HSP40/DNAJ co-chaperone family. Previous studies have shown that HSP40 proteins play a crucial role in protein aggregation and neurodegeneration in several neuronal types, in animal models and human diseases. Interestingly, this mutation causing a loss-of-function of HSJ1 is linked to a pure lower motor neuron disease, strongly suggesting that HSJ1 also plays an important and specific role in motor neurons.\n",
      "Scott syndrome (SS) is a bleeding disorder characterized by a failure to expose phosphatidylserine (PS) to the outer leaflet of the platelet plasma membrane. Because the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) is implicated in the exofacial translocation of PS, we assessed its role in the pathophysiology of a patient with SS. Substantially reduced levels of ABCA1 mRNA were found in the patient's leukocytes, compared with controls. The SS patient was heterozygous for a novel missense mutation c.6064G>A (ABCA1 R1925Q), absent from unaffected family members and controls. Both mutant and wild-type alleles were reduced in mRNA expression, and no causative mutation for this phenomenon was identified in the ABCA1 gene or its proximal promoter, suggesting a putative second mutation in a trans-acting regulatory gene may also be involved in the disorder in this patient. In vitro expression studies showed impaired trafficking of ABCA1 R1925Q to the plasma membrane. Overexpression of wild-type ABCA1 in SS lymphocytes complemented the Ca2+-dependent PS exposure at the cell surface. These data identify a mutation in ABCA1 that contributes to the defective PS translocation phenotype in our patient with SS.\n",
      "A 4-month old boy presented with multiple epileptic seizure types including West syndrome. Screening for infectious and structural etiologies showed normal results. A metabolic investigation was undertaken to investigate the cause of his neurological disease. Screening for congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) by HPLC analysis of serum carbohydrate-deficient transferrin (CDT) showed a type 1 pattern with 18% disialotransferrin (reference < 2%) and 2% asialotransferrin (reference 0). An undiagnosed 10-year old sister with a similar clinical history with infantile spasms at age 4 months, intellectual disability and an autism spectrum disorder, also showed a type 1 CDT pattern. Both siblings lacked dysmorphic features and extra-cerebral symptoms. The boy had cytotoxic edema of the thalamus and mesencephalon on MRI at age 7 months, whereas the girl had normal MRI at age 8 months. Phosphomannomutase (PMM) and phosphomannose isomerase (MPI) activities in cultured fibroblasts were normal, excluding PMM2-CDG and MPI-CDG. Fibroblast lipid-linked oligosaccharide analysis was also normal, suggesting an early defect in glycan assembly. Sequence analysis of the dolichol kinase gene revealed a homozygous new missense mutation (p.M1?; c.2 T > C) in both siblings. In conclusion, two siblings were demonstrated to suffer from DOLK-CDG (MIM 610768) and to be homozygous for a new mutation. They presented with West syndrome and so far show a purely neurological phenotype.\n",
      "A 3-year-old Arab boy with a history of hypoplastic left heart syndrome was referred to the pediatric dermatology clinic at Sheba Medical Center for evaluation of hypomelanosis, manifested by fair skin pigmentation and silvery-grey hair, eyebrows, and eyelashes. The child had one older brother with similar hypopigmentation and another older brother who had died of congenital heart disease. The child had no history of neurologic deficits or immunodeficiency and no additional findings on clinical evaluation.\n",
      "We studied a large kindred with a chronic neurodegenerative disorder, affecting at least six male members in three generations. Spastic paraparesis, beginning at about 10 years of age, and hearing deficits were present in all affected members. Additionally, tremor ophthalmologic abnormalities, sensory deficits, short stature, hypogonadism, elevated cerebrospinal fluid protein, and absent or prolonged somatosensory evoked potentials were seen in some relatives. Although clinically similar to adrenomyeloneuropathy, the plasma and fibroblast levels of saturated very long-chain fatty acids were normal. This syndrome probably represents a new type of familial spastic paraparesis.\n",
      "We describe two infants with hypotonia, absent respiratory effort, and giant mitochondria in neurons due to compound heterozygosity for 2 nonsense mutations of DNM1L. DNM1L has a critical role in regulating mitochondrial morphology and function. This observation confirms the central role of mitochondrial fission to normal human development.\n",
      "We report on 3 Spanish sibs with the Bartsocas-Papas syndrome. This appears to be the seventh reported family; all but one of them are of Mediterranean origin. We propose that a generalized vascular disruption is the most likely pathogenetic mechanism for the anomalies found in this syndrome.\n",
      "Mutations in PLS3 have been identified as a cause of bone fragility in children, but the bone phenotype associated with PLS3 mutations has not been reported in detail. PLS3 is located on the X chromosome and encodes the actin-binding protein plastin 3. Here we describe skeletal findings in 4 boys from 2 families with mutations in PLS3 (c.994_995delGA; p.Asp332* in family 1; c.1433T‚Äâ>‚ÄâC; p.Leu478Pro in family 2). When first evaluated between 4 and 8 years of age, these boys had a history of one to four long-bone fractures. Mild vertebral compression fractures were identified in each boy. No obvious extraskeletal disease manifestations were present. Lumbar spine areal bone mineral density (LS-aBMD) Z-scores ranged from -1.7 to -3.5, but height was normal. Iliac bone histomorphometry in 2 patients showed low trabecular bone volume and a low osteoid maturation time but normal bone formation rate and osteoclast surface. Quantitative backscattered electron imaging (qBEI) did not reveal a major abnormality in bone mineralization density distribution. The 2 boys from family 1 received oral alendronate for 6 years, which normalized LS-aBMD. The mothers of the 4 boys did not have a history of fractures and had normal LS-aBMD. However, one of these mothers had low bone mass at the distal radius, as measured by peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT). In conclusion, hemizygous mutations in PLS3 are associated with osteoporosis and bone fragility in childhood, but in contrast to bone fragility caused by mutations in collagen type I encoding genes, there is no hypermineralization of mineralized bone matrix.\n",

      "Miyoshi-type distal muscular dystrophy (MMD) is an autosomal recessively inherited progressive disorder. The putative locus of MMD is linked to the limb-girdle muscular dystrophy 2B locus on chromosome 2p12-14. In this study three of four MMD pedigrees show non-linkage to the region spanned by D2S134-D2S358-D2S145 on chromosome 2p, indicating genetic heterogeneity. A genome wide screen was performed to identify loci linked to MMD. In two non-chromosome 2-linked families, a 23 cM region on chromosome 10 segregated with MMD.\n",
      "We report a new case of Ohdo syndrome with bilateral patella dislocations where surgical intervention has been indicated. A review of the skeletal manifestations reported in the literature on Ohdo syndrome reveals that joint laxity and skeletal deformities are important aspects of the phenotype.\n",
      "Four cases of a sublethal form of chondrodysplasia are reported. The micromelic dwarfism is severe and on X-ray pictures the most striking feature is the shape of the lower femoral epiphysis, which is relatively well developed and rounded. The mode of inheritance is presumably autosomal recessive.\n",
      "Encephalocraniocutaneous lipomatosis (ECCL) is a rare, sporadic congenital neurocutaneous disorder that characteristically involves ectomesodermal tissues, such as skin, eyes, and central nervous system. A 3-day-old girl presented with swelling in her right eye since birth. Ocular examination of the right eye showed hypertrophy of bulbar conjunctiva with limbal dermoid, clouding of cornea, and atypical upper eyelid coloboma. The left eye showed conjunctival congestion and corneal vascularization. Dermatological examination showed alopecia, nevus psiloliparus, focal dermal hypoplasia on forehead, multiple focal aplastic lesions on the scalp, skin tag at canthus, and lipoma in the fronto-temporal region. Imaging revealed calcification of the right globe, hydrocephalus, agenesis of corpus callosum, multiple intracranial cysts, calcification, and lipomas. The constellation of these clinical and the imaging findings led to a diagnosis of encephalocraniocutaneous lipomatosis. This case report and review of the literature is presented to provide a synopsis of problems likely to be encountered by an ophthalmologist who treats patients with ECCL.\n",
      "The increased use of array-CGH and SNP-arrays for genetic diagnosis has led to the identification of new microdeletion/microduplication syndromes and enabled genotype-phenotype correlations to be made. In this study, nine patients with 9q21 deletions were investigated and compared with four previously Decipher reported patients. Genotype-phenotype comparisons of 13 patients revealed several common major characteristics including significant developmental delay, epilepsy, neuro-behavioural disorders and recognizable facial features including hypertelorism, feature-less philtrum, and a thin upper lip. The molecular investigation identified deletions with different breakpoints and of variable lengths, but the 750 kb smallest overlapping deleted region includes four genes. Among these genes, RORB is a strong candidate for a neurological phenotype. To our knowledge, this is the first published report of 9q21 microdeletions and our observations strongly suggest that these deletions are responsible for a new genetic syndrome characterised by mental retardation with speech delay, epilepsy, autistic behaviour and moderate facial dysmorphy.\n",
      "A 56-year-old white female presented to the emergency room (ER) with acute onset of right upper quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, and she was found to have a sudden drop in hemoglobin. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) with and without intravenous contrast revealed multiple bilobar focal hepatic hypervascular lesions, one of them demonstrating spontaneous rupture with active intraperitoneal bleeding. A moderate hemoperitoneum was present. The patient underwent exploratory laparotomy for right hepatic posterior segmentectomy (right posterior sectionectomy) and peritoneal lavage. The histopathology evaluation revealed multiple liver adenomas. Hepatic adenomatosis is a clinical entity characterized by 10 or more hepatic adenomas. It must be distinguished from isolated hepatic adenoma as it bears a much higher risk of complications, such as spontaneous rupture, hemorrhage and malignant transformation. Here we discuss the radiologic and histopathologic findings of the current case along with a review of the English language medical literature.\n",
      "Proteoglycans are components of the extracellular matrix with diverse biological functions. Defects in proteoglycan synthesis have been linked to several human diseases with common features of short stature, hypermobility, joint dislocations, and skeletal dysplasia. B4GALT7 encodes galactosyltransferase-I that catalyzes the addition of a galactose moiety to a xylosyl group in the tetrasaccharide linker of proteoglycans. Mutations in this gene have been associated with the rare progeroid form of Ehlers Danlos syndrome and in addition more recently found to underlie Larsen of Reunion Island syndrome. Nine individuals have been reported with a diagnosis of the progeroid form of Ehlers Danlos syndrome, four of whom have had molecular characterization showing homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in B4GALT7. We report two newly described patients with compound heterozygous mutations in B4GALT7, and show that the six individuals with confirmed mutations do not have the progeroid features described in the original five patients with a clinical diagnosis of the progeroid form of Ehlers Danlos syndrome. We suggest that galactosyltransferase-I deficiency does not cause the progeroid form of Ehlers Danlos syndrome, but instead results in a clinically recognizable syndrome comprising short stature, joint hypermobility, radioulnar synostosis, and severe hypermetropia. This group of syndromic patients are on a phenotypic spectrum with individuals who have Larsen of Reunion Island syndrome, although the key features of osteopenia, fractures and hypermetropia have not been reported in patients from Reunion Island. √Ç¬© 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\n",
      "We report on the occurrence of a new syndrome of upper limb hypoplasia and M√ºllerian duct anomalies in a French Canadian family. Limb/acral anomalies varied in expression from postaxial polydactyly to ectrodactyly to severe upper limb hypoplasia with split hand. Genital anomalies varied in expression from only a vaginal septum to complete duplication of uterus and vagina in the female to a micropenis in one of two affected males. The syndrome appears to be inherited as an autosomal dominant trait.\n",
      "Congenital myopathy related to mutations in myosin MyHC IIa gene (MYH2) is a rare neuromuscular disease. A single dominant missense mutation has been reported so far in a family in which the affected members had congenital joint contractures at birth, external ophthalmoplegia and proximal muscle weakness. Afterward only additional 4 recessive mutations have been identified in 5 patients presenting a mild non-progressive early-onset myopathy associated with ophthalmoparesis. We report a new de novo MYH2 missense mutation in a baby affected by a congenital myopathy characterized by severe dysphagia, respiratory distress at birth and external ophthalmoplegia. We describe clinical, histopathological and muscle imaging findings expanding the clinical and genetic spectrum of MYH2-related myopathy.\n",
      "Dysspondyloenchondromatosis is a rare form of generalized enchondromatosis associated with spinal involvement. This skeletal dysplasia is characterized by multiple enchondromas present in vertebrae as well as in metaphyseal and diaphyseal parts of the long tubular bones, post-natal short stature, and early development of kyphoscoliosis. A novel heterozygous missense mutation in COL2A1 was recently identified in a patient with dysspondyloenchondromatosis. This suggests that dysspondyloenchondromatosis might expand the already broad spectrum of type II collagenopathies. Here, we report on a young girl with features of dysspondyloenchondromatosis, specifically short stature, thoracoscoliosis, and generalized enchondromas lesions. Sanger sequencing failed to detect a mutation in COL2A1. We therefore suggest that dysspondyloenchondromatosis is a genetically heterogeneous condition.\n",
      "We reported an apparently previously undescribed syndrome, designated the coxoauricular syndrome, in a mother and her 3 daughters, all of whom shared in variable manner shortness of stature, minor vertebral and pelvic changes, dislocated hip(s), and microtia with corresponding hearing loss. The oldest daughter had coincidental Ullrich-Turner syndrome with 46, Xdel(X)(q 13) chromosome constitution. Inheritance of the trait in this family is dominant, either autosomal or X-linked, with hemizygote lethality.\n",
      "We report on a child with mental retardation, spasticity, and distal transverse defects of the limbs born to healthy parents related as first cousin. This is the third child reported to be affected with the syndrome described by Jancar. We confirm the existence of the syndrome as a separate entity and raise possibility that it may be inherited as an autosomal recessive trait.\n",
      "Smith-McCort dysplasia (SMC) is a rare autosomal recessive spondylo-epi-metaphyseal dysplasia with skeletal features identical to those of Dyggve-Melchior-Clausen syndrome (DMC) but with normal intelligence and no microcephaly. Although both syndromes were shown to result from mutations in the DYM gene, which encodes the Golgi protein DYMECLIN, a few SMC patients remained negative in DYM mutation screening. Recently, autozygosity mapping and exome sequencing in a large SMC family have allowed the identification of a missense mutation in RAB33B, another Golgi protein involved in retrograde transport of Golgi vesicles. Here, we report a novel RAB33B mutation in a second SMC case that leads to a marked reduction of the protein as shown by Western blot and immunofluorescence. These data confirm the genetic heterogeneity of SMC dysplasia and highlight the role of Golgi transport in the pathogenesis of SMC and DMC syndromes.\n",
      "One of us recently described an apparently novel ocular syndrome characterized by microcornea, myopic chorioretinal atrophy, and telecanthus (MMCAT) in a number of Saudi families. Consistent with the presumed pseudodominant inheritance in one of the original families, we show that MMCAT maps to a single autozygous locus on chr16q23.1 in which exome sequencing revealed a homozygous missense change in ADAMTS18. Direct sequencing of this gene in four additional probands with the same phenotype revealed three additional homozygous changes in ADAMTS18 including two nonsense mutations. Reassuringly, the autozygomes of all probands overlap on the same chr16q23.1 locus, further supporting the positional mapping of MMCAT to ADAMTS18. ADAMTS18 encodes a member of a family of metalloproteinases that are known for their role in extracellular matrix remodeling, and previous work has shown a strong expression of Adamts18 in the developing eye. Our data suggest that ADAMTS18 plays an essential role in early eye development and that mutations therein cause a distinct eye phenotype that is mainly characterized by microcornea and myopia.\n",
      "In humans, Mammalian Target of Rapamycin (MTOR) encodes a 300 kDa serine/ threonine protein kinase that is ubiquitously expressed, particularly at high levels in brain. MTOR functions as an integrator of multiple cellular processes, and in so doing either directly or indirectly regulates the phosphorylation of at least 800 proteins. While somatic MTOR mutations have been recognized in tumors for many years, and more recently in hemimegalencephaly, germline MTOR mutations have rarely been described.We report the successful application of family-trio Diagnostic Exome Sequencing (DES) to identify the underlying molecular etiology in two brothers with multiple neurological and developmental lesions, and for whom previous testing was non-diagnostic. The affected brothers, who were 6 and 23 years of age at the time of DES, presented symptoms including but not limited to mild Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), megalencephaly, gross motor skill delay, cryptorchidism and bilateral iris coloboma. Importantly, we determined that each affected brother harbored the MTOR missense alteration p.E1799K (c.5395G>A). This exact variant has been previously identified in multiple independent human somatic cancer samples and has been shown to result in increased MTOR activation. Further, recent independent reports describe two unrelated families in whom p.E1799K co-segregated with megalencephaly and intellectual disability (ID); in both cases, p.E1799K was shown to have originated due to germline mosaicism. In the case of the family reported herein, the absence of p.E1799K in genomic DNA extracted from the blood of either parent suggests that this alteration most likely arose due to gonadal mosaicism. Further, the p.E1799K variant exerts its effect by a gain-of-function (GOF), autosomal dominant mechanism.Herein, we describe the use of DES to uncover an activating MTOR missense alteration of gonadal mosaic origin that is likely to be the causative mutation in two brothers who present multiple neurological and developmental abnormalities. Our report brings the total number of families who harbor MTOR p.E1799K in association with megalencephaly and ID to three. In each case, evidence suggests that p.E1799K arose in the affected individuals due to gonadal mosaicism. Thus, MTOR p.E1799K can now be classified as a pathogenic GOF mutation that causes megalencephaly and cognitive impairment in humans.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: The rare congenital combination of microcephaly, lymphedema and chorioretinopathy (MLCD) has been described. Recently, three cases with these clinical characteristics have been diagnosed as having, in addition, various congenital cardiac anomalies, which may be part of this genetic entity that presents with variable expression. CLINICAL OBSERVATION: Here we present a new case of a one-year-old infant who was born with microcephaly and lymphedema and atrial septal defect (ASD) and developed chorioretinopathy at the age of 6 months. This infant had normal neurodevelopment at one year of age. CONCLUSION: We recommend that cardiac evaluation and long-term ophthalmologic follow-up should be part of the evaluation in each child born with microcephaly and lymphedema. Family counseling should include the fact that normal to near-normal development may be possible, despite the presence of microcephaly.\n",
      "Complex II deficiency is a rare cause of mitochondrial respiratory chain defects with a prevalence of 2-23%. It is exclusively nuclear encoded and functions in the citric acid cycle by oxidizing succinate to fumarate and in the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) by transferring electrons to ubiquinone. Of the four subunits, SDHA and SDHB are catalytic and SDHC and SDHD are anchoring. Mutations in SDHA and SDHAF1 (assembly factor) have been found in patients with CII deficiency and a mitochondrial phenotype. We present a patient with CII deficiency with a previously undescribed phenotype of dilated cardiomyopathy, left ventricular noncompaction, failure to thrive, hypotonia, and developmental delay. Also, a comprehensive review of 36 cases published in the literature was undertaken. The results show that CII deficiency has a variable phenotype with no correlation with residual complex activity in muscle although the phenotype and enzyme activities are comparable within a family. For some, the condition was fatal in infancy, others had multisystem involvement and some had onset in adulthood with mild symptoms and normal cognition. Neurological involvement is most commonly observed and brain imaging commonly shows leukoencephalopathy, Leigh syndrome, or cerebellar atrophy. Mutations in SDHAF1 are associated with leukoencephalopathy. Other organ systems like heart, muscle, and eyes are only involved in about 50% of the cases but cardiomyopathy is associated with high mortality and morbidity. In some patients, riboflavin has provided clinical improvement.\n",
      "The ulnar-mammary syndrome (MIM 181450) includes postaxial ray defects, abnormalities of growth, delayed sexual development, and mammary and apocrine gland hypoplasia. Brachydactyly type E (MIM 113300) presents with shortening of the metacarpals and phalanges in the ulnar ray in association with moderately short stature. We describe a three-generation family with variable expression of ulnar/fibular hypoplasia, brachydactyly, ulnar ray defects and short stature. The proband had ulnar hypoplasia with missing IV-Vth fingers, fibular hypoplasia on the right, bilateral club feet, growth retardation, a hypoplastic mid-face, an ASD and hemangiomas. She had normal mammary tissue and normal sweating. The mother had short stature, midfacial hypoplasia, a hypoplastic ulna and hypoplasia of the IVth metacarpal (brachydactyly) on the right without other associated malformations. The maternal grandfather had mild bilateral fibular hypoplasia and midphalangeal brachydactyly of the IV-Vth toes. His sister had mild short stature and shortening of the IVth metacarpal of the left hand. Two-point linkage analysis with microsatellite markers spanning the Ulnar-Mammary locus at 12q24.1 did not confirm linkage. The patients may have a previously undescribed syndrome.\n",
      "Globin-gene mutations are a rare but important cause of cyanosis. We identified a missense mutation in the fetal G√é¬≥-globin gene (HBG2) in a father and daughter with transient neonatal cyanosis and anemia. This new mutation modifies the ligand-binding pocket of fetal hemoglobin by means of two mechanisms. First, the relatively large side chain of methionine decreases both the affinity of oxygen for binding to the mutant hemoglobin subunit and the rate at which it does so. Second, the mutant methionine is converted to aspartic acid post-translationally, probably through oxidative mechanisms. The presence of this polar amino acid in the heme pocket is predicted to enhance hemoglobin denaturation, causing anemia.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: This study aims at presenting prenatal diagnosis of mosaic trisomy 2 and reviewing the literature. MATERIALS, METHODS, AND RESULTS: A 32-year-old woman underwent amniocentesis at 21 weeks of gestation because of abnormal maternal serum biochemistry. Amniocentesis revealed a karyotype of 47,XY,+2[1]/46,XY[21] in in situ cultures. The single colony with trisomy 2 had two metaphase cells, and both had the karyotype of 47,XY,+2. Repeated amniocentesis was performed at 23 weeks of gestation. Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis on uncultured amniocytes using a 2q11.1-specific probe RP11-468G5 (spectrum green) showed three green signals in 11 of 47 uncultured amniocytes, indicating 23.4% mosaicism for trisomy 2. The cultured amniocytes had a karyotype of 46,XY[20 colonies]. Polymorphic DNA marker analysis excluded uniparental disomy 2. The woman underwent the third amniocentesis at 25 weeks of gestation. Interphase FISH analysis on uncultured amniocytes revealed 9.4% (5/53 cells) mosaicism for trisomy 2. The cultured amniocytes had a karyotype of 46,XY[30 colonies]. Prenatal ultrasound was normal. The parents decided to continue the pregnancy to term, and a 3316-g baby was delivered with no phenotypic abnormalities. Cord blood had a karyotype of 46,XY[40 cells]. Interphase FISH analysis on uncultured urinary cells revealed 8.2% (4/49 cells) mosaicism for trisomy 2. The neonate was normal in growth and psychomotor development at 6 months of age. CONCLUSION: Prenatal diagnosis of a single colony with two or more cells with trisomy 2 at amniocentesis should alert a clinically significant aneuploidy, and interphase FISH on uncultured amniocytes is useful for rapid confirmation of low-level trisomy 2 mosaicism at amniocentesis. The abnormal cell line of trisomy 2 may disappear after long-term amniocyte cultures.\n",
      "We report 2 families with an autosomal dominant syndrome of limb and hematologic abnormalities. The W Family was ascertained through AW, a 13-year-old girl, who was purportedly born without congenital anomalies and who was normal until 11 1/2 years when she developed acute lymphoblastic leukemia. She died 2 years later with CNS involvement. Her chromosomes, studied in the first weeks after diagnosis of the disease, were apparently normal. Her father had clinodactyly of both 5th fingers and was found to have panmyelocytopenia refractory to all treatment at 26 years. He died within a year of the onset of his anemia. This man's oldest brother was born with congenital malformations of the elbows and the hands and was healthy until 38 years when he was also found to have an \"idopathic anemia\" and panmyelocytopenia which was refractory to treatment except for transfusions; he died at age 42 years. Both men were initially thought to have the Fanconi anemia syndrome. Their mother died at 71 years of leukemia. DT, the propositus of the second family, was noted to have malformations of both hands at birth. At 21 months he had anemia for which he received transfusions. Family history reveals that several people on the paternal side have severe hand anomalies and a history of childhood anemia. The paternal grandfather died at age 51 of acute monocytic leukemia. Barring genetic heterogeneity, we think that the trait in the W and T families in the same. It is a pleiotropic autosomal dominant mutant which affects radial and ulnar development of the upper limbs and is associated with a relatively high risk of transient or permanent bone marrow arrest with or without leukemia. We propose the hypothesis that apparently increased risk of leukemia to Fanconi heterozygotes actually represents admixture with the WT syndrome and that Fanconi heterozygotes may not have an increased risk of leukemia.\n",
      "This report studies a 42-year-old 46,XX patient affected by palmoplantar keratoderma. clinically classified as Huriez syndrome. The patient showed a male phenotype with apparently normal male features including testicular development. Cytogenetic and chromosomal painting analysis excluded the presence of translocation of the Y chromosome. PCR analysis of genomic DNA failed to detect the presence of the testis-determining gene, SRY. The presence of other Y-chromosome genes, known to be involved in testicular maturation and spermatogenesis, has also been analyzed. The data suggest that the sex reversal in this 46,XX male patient is due to a defect on a yet unidentified autosomal or X-linked sex-determining gene. The relationship between the sex reversion and the presence of sclerotylosis is discussed.\n",
      "Somatostatinoma is a rare endocrine tumor that comprises around 1% of all gastroenteropancreatic endocrine neoplasms. This paper gives an updated review on somatostatinoma and describes three sporadic cases of somatostatinoma located in the pancreas, duodenum, and jejunum. Approximately 200 case histories of somatostatinoma have been published, with the duodenum being the most frequent site, followed by the pancreas. Somatostatinomas may be sporadic or associated with neurofibromatosis type 1, Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 1, and Von Hippel-Lindau syndromes. Functional somatostatinomas release excessive amounts of somatostatin suppressing gallbladder motility and inhibiting the secretory activity of various endocrine and exocrine cell types. A triad of mild diabetes mellitus, cholelithiasis, and diarrhea/steatorrhoea characterizes the somatostatinoma or 'inhibitory' syndrome. Non-functional somatostatinomas tend either to be asymptomatic or to present with obstructive symptoms. These tumors are often malignant and by the time they are detected, nearly two-thirds have already metastasized to the regional lymph nodes or the liver. A comparison between our three cases and those in the literature provides useful insights into the clinical management of these patients. Interestingly, the jejunal somatostatinoma described here is the second case ever reported.\n",
      "Recurrent episodes of high fever during the luteal phase are exceedingly rare. A 14-year-old girl with a 1-year history of recurrent febrile episodes associated with the menstrual cycle was referred to our department. Febrile episode (39-41¬∞C) occurred for 10 to 12 days concomitantly with the luteal phase of each ovulatory cycle. To suppress the ovulatory cycle, gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist was administered for 5 months, and then febrile attack disappeared (34.5-36.2¬∞C). Before and during gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist therapy, serum levels of inflammatory cytokines (interleukin [IL]-1Œ≤, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor-Œ±) were unchanged and all of these were within the normal ranges. In our case, luteal-phase-dependent febrile episodes may not be attributable to the intervention of inflammatory cytokines as major fever mediators.\n",
      "Benign paroxysmal torticollis is an under-recognized cause of torticollis of early infancy. The attacks usually last for less than 1 week, recur from every few days to every few months, improve by age 2 years, and end by age 3. There very frequently is a family history of migraine. We did a detailed analysis of 10 cases of benign paroxysmal torticollis, seen over 5 years, and compared our findings with those in the 103 cases in the literature. Detailed neurodevelopmental assessments, available only in our cases, showed accompanying gross motor delays in 5/10 children, with additional fine motor delays in 3/5. As the benign paroxysmal torticollis improved, so did the gross motor delays in 3/5, and the fine motor delays in 1/3. In all of our cases, at least 2 other family members had migraine. Benign paroxysmal torticollis is likely an age-sensitive, migraine-related disorder, commonly accompanied by delayed motor development.\n",
      "Clinical pictures of 21 cases with I-cell disease patients, 12 males and 9 females, were analyzed. Characteristic coarse facial features and shortness of stature were observed in all cases. In general, the motor development was found to be more severely retarded than the mental development of the patients. Rather little involvement of the nervous system seemed to cause somewhat acceptable mental development in some cases, and also cause the absence of epileptic seizures in all cases. Involvement of the cardiovascular system, especially progressive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, could be highly responsible for frequent sudden death of I-cell disease patients.\n",
      "Very few reports on the phenotype of short fifth metacarpals have been published in the medical literature. We report a Jordanian family in which three sisters aged 15, 13 and 8 years revealed bilateral shortening of the fifth fingers and radiological shortening of the fifth metacarpals. The father had unilateral short fifth metacarpal. The elder two sisters, their father as well as their brother and another sister manifested insulin resistance. Spherocytosis was diagnosed in one of the girls and her father. The parents are non-consanguineous. This constellation of findings has not been previously reported and could point to the presence of two disorders segregating in the family or to a novel syndrome with autosomal dominant inheritance and variable expressivity.\n",
      "Brain-lung-thyroid syndrome (OMIM #610978) is associated with mutations in the NK2 homeobox 1 (NKX2-1) gene, a transcription factor important in development. 50% of patients are affected by the full triad, comprising congenital hypothyroidism, benign hereditary chorea and infant respiratory distress syndrome. Four cases have previously been reported where a patient has features consistent with brain-lung-thyroid syndrome and a chromosome 14q13 deletion adjacent to, but not disrupting, NKX2-1. We present a patient who has a phenotype consistent with brain-lung-thyroid syndrome, featuring congenital hypothyroidism and choreoathetoid movements with gross motor delay. Thyroid ultrasound showed a small-normal gland and spontaneous resolution of hypothyroidism. Array CGH revealed a de novo 14q13.2-3 deletion adjacent to but not directly involving NKX2-1. Sequencing of NKX2-1 was normal. This report highlights a further case of chromosomal deletion adjacent to NXK2-1 in a patient with a phenotype consistent with brain-lung-thyroid syndrome, and confirms that array-CGH is a useful test in the investigation of congenital hypothyroidism. Deletion of the adjacent gene MBIP in most reported cases so far may be relevant to the pathogenesis of brain-lung-thyroid syndrome. Deletion of nearby promoter or enhancer elements acting on NKX2-1 could also be an important factor. However, further work is needed to elucidate the pathogenesis of the brain-lung-thyroid phenotype in such cases.\n",
      "Angelman syndrome (AS) is a neurogenetic disorder caused by loss of expression of the maternal imprinted gene UBE3A on chromosome 15q11.2-q13. Clinical features of AS include severe intellectual disability, a happy disposition, ataxia, mandibular prognatism, and epilepsy. Our objectives were to examine the birth incidence of AS in Denmark and to characterize the size of the 15q11.2-q13 deletions with 1,000K array CGH. In addition, we analyzed genotype differences in regard to age at diagnosis and investigated the occurrence of deletions/duplications outside the 15q11.2-q13 regions. We identified 51 patients with genetically verified AS, which corresponded to a birth incidence of 1:24,580 (95%CI: 1:23,727-1:25,433). Thirty-six patients showed a deletion; 13 had a Class I deletion and 20 had a Class II deletion. There was bimodal distribution of the BP3 breakpoint. Three patients had larger and atypical deletions, with distal breakpoints telomeric to BP3. Five patients had paternal uniparental disomy (pUPD) of chromosome 15, and four had a verified UBE3A mutation. Additional deletions/duplications outside the 15q11.2-q13 areas were demonstrated in half the participants. Six harbored more than one CNV. Mean age at diagnosis was 21 months (95%CI: 17-23 months) for children with a deletion and 46 months (95%CI: 36-55 months) for children with pUPD or a UBE3A mutation (P < 0.01). The presence of a CNV outside 15q11.2-q13 did not have an impact on age at diagnosis.\n",
      "A new lethal form of acrofacial dysostosis (AFD) syndrome was delineated by Rodriguez et al. [Rodriguez et al. (1990); Am J Med Genet 35:484-489]. We report on a male fetus with mandibulofacial dysostosis, including phocomelia-like upper limb deficiencies and lower limb anomalies which are characteristic of AFD Rodriguez type. The diagnosis was made on prenatal sonogram at 20 and at 24.1 weeks gestation. The severity of the upper limb defects, the involvement of lower limbs, and the absence of eyelid coloboma and polythelia excluded the possibility of other conditions associated with acrofacial dysostosis (AFD) including Nager acrofacial dysostosis syndrome (NADS) and postaxial acrofacial dysostosis syndrome (POADS). This case further delineates the AFD syndrome type Rodriguez.\n",
      "Although androgen resistance has been characterized in men with a normal chromosome complement and mutations in the androgen-receptor gene, a mutation in the gene encoding estrogen receptor Œ± (ESR1) was previously described only in one man and not, to our knowledge, in a woman. We now describe an 18-year-old woman without breast development and with markedly elevated serum levels of estrogens and bilateral multicystic ovaries. She was found to have a homozygous loss-of-function ESR1 mutation in a completely conserved residue that interferes with estrogen signaling. Her clinical presentation was similar to that in the mouse orthologue knockout. This case shows that disruption of ESR1 causes profound estrogen resistance in women.

      "We describe a 10-month-old boy with an unclassified form of radial aplasia with absent thumbs, tibia hypo/-aplasia, and partial absence of toes. Only a few cases with similar limb deficiencies have been published. We try to classify the malformations on the basis of embryological considerations and discuss possible differential diagnosis.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: To identify the underlying genetic defect in a patient with intellectual disability, seizures, ataxia, macrothrombocytopenia, renal and cardiac involvement, and abnormal protein glycosylation. METHODS: Genetic studies involved homozygosity mapping by 250K single nucleotide polymorphism array and SLC35A1 sequencing. Functional studies included biochemical assays for N-glycosylation and mucin-type O-glycosylation and SLC35A1-encoded cytidine 5'-monophosphosialic acid (CMP-sialic acid) transport after heterologous expression in yeast. RESULTS: We performed biochemical analysis and found combined N- and O-glycosylation abnormalities and specific reduction in sialylation in this patient. Homozygosity mapping revealed homozygosity for the CMP-sialic acid transporter SLC35A1. Mutation analysis identified a homozygous c.303G > C (p.Gln101His) missense mutation that was heterozygous in both parents. Functional analysis of mutant SLC35A1 showed normal Golgi localization but 50% reduction in transport activity of CMP-sialic acid in vitro. CONCLUSION: We confirm an autosomal recessive, generalized sialylation defect due to mutations in SLC35A1. The primary neurologic presentation consisting of ataxia, intellectual disability, and seizures, in combination with bleeding diathesis and proteinuria, is discriminative from a previous case described with deficient sialic acid transporter. Our study underlines the importance of sialylation for normal CNS development and regular organ function.\n",
      "Deletions of the distal part of the 6q chromosome have not been associated with a clearly distinctive and recognizable phenotype. In order to determine if a \"6q terminal deletion syndrome\" could be delineated, we compared the phenotype of two new cases with those patients reported in literature presenting with a similar deletion. Cases with more complex karyotypes were excluded. The deletion in our patients was accurately analyzed by loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with a panel of probes located around the putative breakpoint. Interestingly, the breakpoints were located in 6q26 in both our patients, distally to clone RP11-150P20 and proximally to clone RP11-152P19, with a deletion size of approximately 8 Mb. The breakpoints fall within the fragile site FRA6E. From a careful evaluation of the selected patients, a common phenotype emerged, including psychomotor retardation, hypotonia, seizures, short neck, and typical facial anomalies, along with nonspecific anomalies. While these features are shared by other chromosome syndromes and are not sufficient on their own for a clinical diagnosis, when considered together, the pattern can allow the identification of the \"6q terminal deletion syndrome.\" Moreover, the potential role of FRA6E in generating these deletions is suggested.\n",
      "The endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation pathway is responsible for the translocation of misfolded proteins across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane into the cytosol for subsequent degradation by the proteasome. To define the phenotype associated with a novel inherited disorder of cytosolic endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation pathway dysfunction, we studied a series of eight patients with deficiency of N-glycanase 1.Whole-genome, whole-exome, or standard Sanger sequencing techniques were employed. Retrospective chart reviews were performed in order to obtain clinical data.All patients had global developmental delay, a movement disorder, and hypotonia. Other common findings included hypolacrima or alacrima (7/8), elevated liver transaminases (6/7), microcephaly (6/8), diminished reflexes (6/8), hepatocyte cytoplasmic storage material or vacuolization (5/6), and seizures (4/8). The nonsense mutation c.1201A>T (p.R401X) was the most common deleterious allele.NGLY1 deficiency is a novel autosomal recessive disorder of the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation pathway associated with neurological dysfunction, abnormal tear production, and liver disease. The majority of patients detected to date carry a specific nonsense mutation that appears to be associated with severe disease. The phenotypic spectrum is likely to enlarge as cases with a broader range of mutations are detected.\n",
      "Three unusual cases of focal continuous myoclonus with onset during the first months of life, lasting from dozens of minutes to hours, are reported. During disease evolution, prolonged bilateral myoclonic seizures and generalized tonic-clonic seizures occur. Subsequently, a progressive encephalopathy with hypotonia and ataxia appears. A net worsening of the neurological condition is observed after the age of 4-5 years. Cortical atrophy is shown by CCT and MRI. Neurometabolic screening is not contributory. Repeated polygraphic recordings show continuous and segmental myoclonic jerks, localized in different muscles, at frequencies ranging between 0.5-1 c/s and 6-8 c/s. Moreover action myoclonus is recorded. During the first period of disease the EEG does not show any paroxysmal activity. As to the classification, this syndrome corresponds to an early onset progressive encephalopathy of unknown origin, similar in some aspects to Alper's disease. Another problem is the interpretation of the myoclonic phenomena. Some important aspects suggest a cortical origin of the diverse myoclonic phenomena observed in these cases.\n",
      "We report a 35-year-old male with a ring chromosome 12 originally diagnosed 20 years prior to presentation with an ischemic stroke. Array CGH analysis revealed a sub-microscopic microdeletion and microduplication within 12p13.3 and a microdeletion in 12q24.33. FISH analysis further revealed that the duplication was in an inverted orientation and included exons 35-52 of the dosage-sensitive Von Willebrand Factor (VWF) gene. Partial duplication of this gene, which has a role in the clotting cascade, suggests a potential mechanism for generating a pro-thrombotic state that may have contributed to a premature cerebrovascular event. Evidence of raised VWF antigen levels and VWF activity levels in the highest quartile provides support for this hypothesis. This case illustrates that when a ring chromosome is identified, the possibility of cryptic genomic rearrangements needs to be considered as these may have implications in predicting natural history.\n",
      "Three- and four-year-old brothers, ostensibly with a nonprogressive spastic quadriparesis, had retinitis pigmentosa and mental retardation. One had clinical deafness. The brothers showed little developmental progress in infancy and exhibited deterioration in childhood. Known metabolic and acquired causes were excluded. Although they have some features of several other syndromes,the condition reported here is unique.\n",
      "Recurrent deletions of 2q32q33 have recently been reported as a new microdeletion syndrome, clinical features of which include significant learning difficulties, growth retardation, dysmorphic features, thin and sparse hair, feeding difficulties, and cleft or high palate. Haploinsufficiency of one gene within the deleted region, SATB2, has been suggested to be responsible for most of the features of the syndrome. This article describes seven previously unreported patients with deletions at 2q33.1, all partially overlapping the previously described critical region for the 2q33.1 microdeletion syndrome. The deletions ranged in size from 35 kb to 10.4 Mb, with the smallest deletion entirely within the SATB2 gene. Patients demonstrated significant developmental delay and challenging behaviour, a particular behavioural phenotype that seems to be emerging with more reported patients with this condition. One patient in this cohort has a deletion entirely within SATB2 and has a cleft palate, whereas several patients with larger deletions have a high arched palate. In addition, one other patient has significant orthopaedic problems with ligamentous laxity. Interestingly, this patient has a deletion that lies just distal to SATB2. The orthopaedic problems have not been reported previously and are possibly an additional feature of this syndrome. Overall, this report provides further evidence that the SATB2 gene is the critical gene in this microdeletion syndrome. In addition, because the individuals in this study range in age from 3-19 years, these patients will help define the natural progression of the phenotype in patients with this microdeletion.\n",
      "Schwartz-Jampel syndrome (SJS), first described in the United States in 1962, is a hereditary disorder characterized by facial dysmorphism and muscle stiffness. We describe the first case of a Persian 9-year-old boy with SJS and review the literature. The child had a short neck, blepharophimosis, flattened face, hypertrichosis of the eyelids, prominent eyebrows, high arched palate, low set ears, micrognathia, short stature, and skeletal deformities. He had proximal muscle hypertrophy, distal muscle wasting and generalized hyporeflexia. Bone X-ray revealed pseudofracture of humerus. Needle electromyography revealed continuous myotonic discharges at rest with no waxing and waning in all tested muscles. Based on clinical and electrodiagnostic findings, the diagnosis of SJS type 1B was made and procainamide was started which resulted in clinical improvement. The diagnosis of SJS should be suspected when a child presents with the triad of myotonia, facial dysmorphism and skeletal deformities.\n",
      "Mitochondrial encephalopathies are a heterogeneous group of disorders that, usually carry grave prognosis. Recently a homozygous mutation, Gly372Ser, in the TIMM50 gene, was reported in an abstract form, in three sibs who suffered from intractable epilepsy and developmental delay accompanied by 3-methylglutaconic aciduria. We now report on four patients from two unrelated families who presented with severe intellectual disability and seizure disorder, accompanied by slightly elevated lactate level, 3-methylglutaconic aciduria and variable deficiency of mitochondrial complex V. Using exome analysis we identified two homozygous missense mutations, Arg217Trp and Thr252Met, in the TIMM50 gene. The TIMM50 protein is a subunit of TIM23 complex, the mitochondrial import machinery. It serves as the major receptor in the intermembrane space, binding to proteins which cross the mitochondrial inner membrane on their way to the matrix. The mutations, which affected evolutionary conserved residues and segregated with the disease in the families, were neither present in large cohorts of control exome analyses nor in our ethnic specific exome cohort. Given the phenotypic similarity, we conclude that missense mutations in TIMM50 are likely manifesting by severe intellectual disability and epilepsy accompanied by 3-methylglutaconic aciduria and variable mitochondrial complex V deficiency. 3-methylglutaconic aciduria is emerging as an important biomarker for mitochondrial dysfunction, in particular for mitochondrial membrane defects.\n",
      "This paper describes seven persons in a family affected with an autosomal dominant syndrome of short stature with mesomelic shortness of upper and lower limbs, abnormal carpal and tarsal bones, hypoplastic or absent middle phalanges of hands and feet, and delayed coalescence of bipartite calcanei. All affected relatives are of normal intelligence, are free of eye problems, and have a normal skull, spine, shoulders, and hips. The digits of the hands and feet are short, broad, and angulated. The hypoplastic or absent middle phalanges effectively result in one interphalangeal joint for each digit, with decreased mobility. The bones of the carpus and tarsus coalesce with increasing age. None of the previously described syndromes or brachydactylies encompasses the findings noted in this kindred.\n",
      "PURPOSE:Transaldolase deficiency is a recently described inborn error of pentose phosphate pathway. We conducted this study to further delineate the associated phenotype. METHODS AND RESULTS:We report on 12 new cases representing six families with this metabolic defect that were observed over an 8 year span. None of these cases received the correct diagnosis initially because of significant overlap in the presenting symptoms (growth retardation, dysmorphic features, cutis laxa, congenital heart disease, hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia, and bleeding tendency) with a wide range of genetic disorders. However, the consanguineous nature of these families allowed us to pursue autozygome analysis, which highlighted TALDO as the likely candidate gene and sequencing confirmed segregation of a novel homozygous mutation with the disease in all the studied families. Biochemical analysis was also consistent with transaldolase deficiency. CONCLUSION:This study expands the clinical definition of transaldolase deficiency, and adds to its allelic heterogeneity. In addition, we emphasize the diagnostic challenge posed by this rare and pleiotropic metabolic disorder.\n",
      "We report on a third case of hypomandibular faciocranial dysostosis and review the literature. Manifestations include craniosynostosis, prominent eyes, deficient midface and zygomatic arches, short nose with anteverted nares, protruding lower face, minute oral aperture, persistent buccopharyngeal membrane, and severe mandibular hypoplasia. In contrast to coronal synostosis found in the 2 earlier cases, our patient had multiple sutural synostosis. The 2 affected sibs reported earlier suggest the possibility of autosomal recessive inheritance. However, gonadal mosaicism for a dominant mutation or an undetected microdeletion must also be considered at this early stage in the delineation of this disorder.\n",
      "BACKGROUND:There are three distinct subtypes of Trichorhinophalangeal syndrome (TRPS); TRPS type I, TRPS type II and TRPS type III. Features common to all three subtypes include sparse, slowly growing scalp hair, laterally sparse eyebrows, a bulbous tip of the nose (pear-shaped), and protruding ears. Langer-Giedion syndrome (LGS) or TRPS type II is a contiguous gene syndrome on 8q24.1, involving loss of functional copies of the TRPS1 and EXT1 genes. We report a male patient that was referred to the Department of Medical Genetics due to hypotonia and dysmorphic facial features. RESULTS:Cytogenetic and array- Comparative Genomic Hybridization (aCGH) analysis revealed that the patient was a carrier of an interstitial deletion at 8q23.1-q24.12 of 12,5¬†Mb. Parental karyotype indicated that the father carried an apparently balanced insertion: 46, ŒßŒ•, der(10)ins(10;8)(q22;q23q24). CONCLUSIONS:This is the first report of an apparently balanced insertion including chromosomes 8 and 10 contributing to the etiology of LGS/ TRPS type II. Œ§imely diagnosis of parental balanced chromosomal rearrangements can reduce the risk of subsequent miscarriages as well as abnormal offspring.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: To report in vivo corneal confocal microscopic findings of patients with central cloudy dystrophy of Fran√ßois. METHODS: Two unrelated patients, a 78-year-old man and a 75-year-old woman, with central cloudy dystrophy of Fran√ßois were examined using routine slitlamp biomicroscopy and confocal microscopy. RESULTS: In both cases, slitlamp biomicroscopy showed bilateral polygonal opacities separated by clear spaces. The corneal opacities were most prominent centrally and were located in the deeper stromal layer immediately anterior to the Descemet membrane. By confocal microscopy, normal superficial and basal epithelial layers, midstromal layers, and endothelial layers were noted in both cases. However, small highly refractile granules and deposits were observed in the anterior stromal layer in both cases. Also, multiple dark striae among the extracellular matrix with increased intensities were observed in the posterior stroma adjacent to the corneal endothelial layer in both cases. CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal stromal deposits and multiple dark striae were observed in central cloudy dystrophy of Fran√ßois using in vivo corneal confocal microscopy. Use of confocal microscopy to investigate these abnormal stromal opacities may be helpful in differentiating various corneal stromal pathologic features.\n",
      "The homeodomain protein IPF1 (also known as IDX1, STF1 and PDX1; see Methods) is critical for development of the pancreas in mice and is a key factor for the regulation of the insulin gene in the beta-cells of the endocrine pancreas. Targeted disruption of the Ipf1 gene encoding IPF1 in transgenic mice results in a failure of the pancreas to develop (pancreatic agenesis). Here, we report the identification of a single nucleotide deletion within codon 63 of the human IPF1 gene (13q12.1) in a patient with pancreatic agenesis. The patient is homozygous for the point deletion, whereas both parents are heterozygotes for the same mutation. The deletion was not found in 184 chromosomes from normal individuals, indicating that the mutation is unlikely to be a rare polymorphism. The point deletion causes a frame shift at the C-terminal border of the transactivation domain of IPF1 resulting in the translation of 59 novel codons before termination, aminoproximal to the homeodomain essential for DNA binding. Expression of mutant IPF1 in Cos-1 cells confirms the expression of a prematurely terminated truncated protein of 16 kD. Thus, the affected patient should have no functional IPF1 protein. Given the essential role of IPF1 in pancreas development, it is likely that this autosomal recessive mutation is the cause of the pancreatic agenesis phenotype in this patient. Thus, IPF1 appears to be a critical regulator of pancreas development in humans as well as mice.\n",
      "Polyvalvular heart disease has been reported in a handful of \"private\" syndromes that have been recently suggested to represent a single dominantly inherited condition, the polyvalvular heart disease syndrome. We report five cases in two unrelated families (one sporadic case in the first family and three siblings and their father in the second family) with the same association of polyvalvular heart disease, distinctive facial appearance, and, except the father in family 2, major joint hypermobility. Interestingly, in three of our patients (2 siblings and the sporadic case), electron microscopy revealed characteristic ultrastructural skin abnormalities with abnormal amorphous or microfibrillar deposits under the capillary basal membrane in the papillary dermis, suggestive of a connective tissue disorder, but different from Marfan syndrome or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Moreover, in family 2, three others sibs died in early infancy of their heart defect. Our two families and the other published cases might illustrate intrafamilial and interfamilial variability within a single condition. However, our two families disclose major joint hypermobility, normal stature, and ultrastructural skin abnormalities that were not described in the previous reports. These discrepancies let us to consider them as affected by a distinct disorder of the connective tissue.\n",
      "In this report we present two brothers with abnormal neurological development, hypotonia, short stature, pylorus stenosis, pectus excavatum, brachycephaly due to craniosynostosis, frontal bossing, depressed nasal bridge, high arched-wide palate, downslant palpebral fissures, low-set, large ears, thin upper lip and bilateral cryptorchidism. The brothers were born to a couple of second cousins and were the third and fourth pregnancies of the mother. The father, the mother and the eldest sibling were phenotypically and chromosomally normal. The clinical findings of the brothers were found to be similar. These clinical findings were compared with syndromes showing some of the symptoms, namely Apert, FG, Floating-Harbor, Shprintzen-Goldberg and Rett Syndromes. However, when the findings were detailed, we observed that they did not match completely any of the syndromes in a discernable way. The MECP2 gene mutation was analysed because of mental retardation, poor neurological evolution and large ears, but no mutation was found. So these cases are presented as a new syndrome with apparent autosomal recessive inheritance.\n",
      "Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is a group of autosomal dominant and recessive blistering skin diseases in which pathogenic mutations have been reported in 13 different genes encoding structural proteins involved in keratinocyte integrity, as well as cell-matrix or cell-cell adhesion. We now report an inherited skin fragility disorder with a homozygous nonsense mutation in the dystonin gene (DST) that encodes the coiled-coil domain of the epithelial isoform of bullous pemphigoid antigen 1, BPAG1-e (also known as BP230). The mutation, p.Gln1124X, leads to the loss of hemidesmosomal inner plaques and a complete absence of skin immunostaining for BPAG1-e, as well as reduced labeling for plectin, the beta4 integrin subunit, and for type XVII collagen. The 38-year-old affected individual has lifelong generalized trauma-induced spontaneous blisters and erosions, particularly around the ankles. In addition, he experiences episodic numbness in his limbs, which started at the age of 37 years. These neurological symptoms may also be due to DST gene mutation, although he has a concomitant diagnosis of CADASIL (cerebral arteriopathy, autosomal dominant, with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy), a cerebral small-vessel arteriopathy, which thus complicates the genotype-phenotype interpretation. With regard to skin blistering, the clinicopathological findings expand the molecular basis of EB by identifying BPAG1-e pathology in a new form of autosomal recessive EB simplex.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: Limb-body wall complex (LBWC) is a rare fetal polymalformation of uncertain etiology, but it has been regarded as sporadic in nature with a low recurrence risk. We review a case series in light of recent evidence about possible genetic and environmental associations. METHODS: All abortions or births coded as limb-body wall defect or fetal acrania/exencephaly or with unclassified polymalformation between January 1996 and January 2001 were audited. RESULTS: During the 5-year period there were 33,286 live births in our region. Eleven cases met the criteria of LBWC giving an incidence of 0.33/1000 live births. In 50%, 50% and 30% of women a history of cigarette, alcohol and marijuana use, respectively, was noted. Furthermore, 40% of the women had a history of a previous infant with a congenital anomaly. One patient delivered two consecutive male infants with LBWC. CONCLUSIONS: Whilst the majority of cases of LBWC are sporadic, some women may have an underlying genetic predisposition. It may be prudent to advise against the use of alcohol, cigarettes and other drugs and to offer an ultrasound scan in a tertiary referral center in a subsequent pregnancy.\n",
      "Mammary-digital-nail syndrome is a novel phenotypic association consisting of anonychia onychodystrophy with hypoplasia or absence of distal phalanges in males and females, accompanied by juvenile hypertrophy of the breast in affected females. This newly described genetic trait presents an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, with either reduced penetrance or germ-line mosaicism. Analysis of the pedigree, linkage studies followed by a genome-wide screen and by haplotype analysis defined the locus for the phenotype within a 12 cM (4.3 Mb) interval on chromosome 22q12.3-13.1. This chromosomal region has not been implicated before in genetic disorders of the mammary tissue or limbs. These data suggest a possibly novel signaling pathway affecting the organogenesis of limbs and mammary glands in humans.\n",
      "Three of nine children of possibly consanguineous American Indian parents developed typical osteosarcoma in a 2-year period. Etiologic investigations detected limb anomalies and elevated mean corpuscular volumes (98--109 micrometer3) in the surviving tumor patient, several of her sibs, and her father. Limb anomalies included simple clinodactyly with brachymesophalangy, absence of one digital ray of the foot, and bilateral radioulnar synostosis. The red cell macrocytosis was not accompanied by anemia or explained by the usual causes. No unusual environmental exposures were found and screening for possible oncogenic viruses by culture, electron microscopy, and serology was negative. All family members had elevated antibody titers to Epstein-Barr viral antigens. The proband and her father had excessive chromosomal breaks in the bone marrow. This unusual familial pattern of osseous malignancy and malformation and defective erythropoiesis, tentatively called OSLAM syndrome, may represent impaired regulation of bone development.\n",
      "We describe a female neonate with ovarian torsion, ovarian follicular and dermoid cysts, congenital ascites, pleural effusions, and respiratory distress. Her symptoms were consistent with atypical Meigs' syndrome and resolved after unilateral oophorectomy. This is the first report in a neonate of this syndrome in association with congenital ovarian disease.\n",
      "We report on 2 brothers, born to consanguineous parents presenting thin/long face, small ears, blepharophimosis, malar hypoplasia, long neck, pectus excavatum, brachycamptodactyly, and sacral dimple. We suspect that these patients represent a previously undescribed autosomal recessive syndrome.\n",
      "We report a mother and son who have a microcephaly with a characteristic dysmorphic face. Prominent manifestations include facial asymmetry, prominent glabella, deafness, low-set, cup-shaped ears, thick, protruding lower lip, micrognathia, and mental retardation. We conclude that these patients have a previously undescribed type of genetic microcephaly. The mother has become normocephalic and we would not have been able to diagnose her condition without her childhood photographs. Such photographs are essential in the recognition of familial syndromes.\n",
      "Acute encephalopathy with biphasic seizures and reduced diffusion (AESD) is a syndrome of encephalopathy characterized by biphasic seizures and altered consciousness in the acute stage followed in the subacute stage by restricted diffusion in the subcortical white matter on magnetic resonance imaging. The etiology of AESD has been attributed to viral infection like influenza A and human herpes virus 6. The exact pathogenesis of AESD is uncertain. Here we report a case of AESD, diagnosed based on clinicoradiological correlation.\n",
      "To date, four families with spinocerebellar ataxia type 5 (SCA5) with four distinct mutations in the spectrin, beta, nonerythrocytic 2 gene (SPTBN2) have been reported worldwide. In the present study, we identified the first Japanese family with SCA5, and analyzed this family clinically and genetically. The clinical features of the five patients in this family revealed late-onset autosomal-dominant pure cerebellar ataxia. We collected DNA samples from the majority of the family members across two generations, and exome sequencing combined with Sanger sequencing revealed a novel heterozygous three-nucleotide in-frame deletion mutation (c.2608_2610delGAG) in exon 14 of the SPTBN2 gene. This mutation cosegregated with the disease in the family and resulted in a glutamic acid deletion (p.E870del) in the sixth spectrin repeat, which is highly conserved in the SPTBN2 gene. This is the first three-nucleotide in-frame deletion mutation in this region of the beta-3 spectrin protein highly likely to be pathogenic based on exome and bioinformatic data.\n",
      "Two siblings with total regional choroidal atrophy and other manifestations of ectodermal dysplasia are presented. The mode of inheritance is uncertain, but mild macular disease in the father may represent heterozygote manifestation of a recessive condition.\n",
      "Inactivating mutations in HNF1A and HNF4A cause the maturity-onset diabetes of youth (MODY)-3 and MODY1 forms of monogenic diabetes, respectively. Children carrying HNF4A (MODY1) mutations can present in early infancy with macrosomia and diazoxide-responsive hyperinsulinism.Our objective was to describe three novel cases of hyperinsulinism associated with MODY1 and MODY3 mutations.Clinical data were obtained from chart review. Gene sequencing was performed on genomic DNA.Case 1 was diagnosed at 20 months with persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia and was found to have a novel MODY3 HNF1A mutation, carried by her father who had diabetes. Case 2 was diagnosed with diazoxide-responsive hyperinsulinism at 3 months of age and had complete resolution of hyperinsulinism by 4 yr. She was found to have a novel MODY3 HNF1A missense mutation, also carried by her father. Case 3 presented as a newborn with diazoxide-responsive hyperinsulinism and later developed renal Fanconi syndrome, hypophosphatemic rickets, and hepatic glycogenosis. Although the latter's features suggested Fanconi-Bickel syndrome, sequencing of the SLC2A2 gene was normal. The patient was found to have a known MODY1 mutation in HNF4A. In all cases, the hyperinsulinism improved with age.The first two cases demonstrate that mutations in HNF1A (MODY3) can cause hyperinsulinism early in life and diabetes later, similar to the phenotype recently reported for HNF4A (MODY1) mutations. Case 3 indicates that the effects of HNF4A mutations in infancy may extend beyond pancreatic Œ≤-cells to produce a disorder similar to glucose transporter 2 deficiency involving both liver glycogen metabolism and renal tubular transport.\n",
      "INTRODUCTION:Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare skin tumor with a highly malignant nature whose appropriate treatment is still debated. Wide surgery is the treatment of choice, but the question concerning protocols for adjuvant radiotherapy or chemotherapy remains open. PATIENTS AND METHODS:A retrospective analysis of 24 cases of MCC collected over a period of 9 years was performed, focusing on clinical and histologic features, and response to treatment. RESULTS:There were 17 women and 7 men with a mean age of 74.3 years. The median follow up was 34 months. The annual incidence per 100,000 habitants was 0.378. The head and neck localization was predominant (54%). Fifteen (68%) of patients presented with local disease (stage I), and 32% of patients presented with regional node (stage II) or distant metastases (stage III). Patients with stage I had a 5-years overall survival rate of 73,85%. Among them, five patients (33%) developed a local or nodal recurrence, although two patients were initially treated with surgery and local post-operative radiotherapy. Patients with stage II and III demonstrated a 5-year overall survival rate of 51,43%. DISCUSSION:Our series illustrates the clinical characteristics of this tumor of the elderly, which is mainly located on head and neck and associated with a poor prognosis.

      "Congenital hypomelanotic and hypermelanotic macules traced in three generations of a family suggested autosomal dominant inheritance. Some affected membbers also showed retarded growth and mental deficiency. Light microscopic findings of \"splitdopa\" preparations of lesional and normal skin were comparable, except that background staining of keratinocytes in dark macules was higher than in control skin. In light macules it was lower. Ultrastructurally, hypomelanotic skin showed small melanosomes (0.3 mu) that occurred in keratinocytes in melanosome complexes. Hypermelanotic skin revealed large melanosomes (0.6 mu) that were singly distributed in keratinocytes. Melanosome size in normal skin averaged 0.4 mu; distribution pattern was mixed. Melanin granules inside keratinocytes were fully melanized. Hyperpigmented, normal and hypopigmented skin of one person had histological features of black oriental and white skin. This clinical picture could well represent a new neurocutaneous syndrome different from tuberous sclerosis.\n",
      "We describe a total of 18 individuals, in 3 families, with a median nodule of the upper lip. In family 1, the proposita, an 8-month-old infant girl, was otherwise phenotypically normal except for a median nodule of the upper lip. The proposita's elder brother and mother, both phenotypically normal, also had the similar nodule of the upper lip. On the mother's side, the proposita's greatgrandmother, greatgrandaunt, grandfather, greataunt, two aunts, and one female cousin all had a median nodule of the upper lip. In family 2, the proposita, proposita's mother and maternal grandfather had a median nodule of the upper lip. In family 3, the proposita, proposita's father, paternal grandfather, paternal uncle, and cousin had a median nodule of the upper lip. Analysis of 3 families indicates that the condition is an autosomal dominant trait.\n",
      "We report two unrelated children with onset of chronic diarrhea and villous atrophy in the first years of life. Elevated plasma lactate concentrations and lactate/pyruvate and ketone body molar ratios suggested a genetic defect of oxidative phosphorylation. Analysis of the mitochondrial respiratory chain showed a complex III deficiency in muscle of both patients. Southern blot analysis provided evidence of heteroplasmic mitochondrial DNA rearrangements that involve deletion and deletion-duplication. Directly repeated sequences (10 and 11 base pairs, respectively) were present in the wild type of mitochondrial genome at the boundaries of the deletion. Neither parent of either patient had rearranged molecules in their circulating lymphocytes. It appears that a mitochondrial disorder can have chronic diarrhea and villous atrophy as the initial clinical feature. On the basis of these observations, we suggest that genetic defects of mitochondrial energy supply be considered in elucidating the origin of unexplained chronic diarrheas, especially when other, unrelated symptoms occur in the course of the disease.\n",
      "We report three sibs with congenital heart disease, round face with depressed nasal bridge, small mouth, short stature, developmental retardation, relatively dark skin, and high axial triradius. The chromosomes of the three patients were normal and the parents were unrelated, healthy, and of normal intelligence. The mother denied infections, drinking, drug intake, or exposure to known teratogenic agents during each pregnancy.\n",
      "Methemoglobin is a form of hemoglobin that does not bind oxygen. When its concentration is elevated in red blood cells, functional anemia and tissue hypoxia may occur. We performed a retrospective case series to describe the cases of acquired methemoglobinemia (methemoglobin level >2%) detected and the clinical circumstances under which they occurred at 2 tertiary care hospitals and affiliated outpatient clinics over 28 months. We surveyed co-oximetry laboratory data to identify patients with methemoglobinemia. We reviewed these patients' medical records to extract the clinical information and context. One hundred thirty-eight cases of acquired methemoglobinemia were detected over the 28 months. There was no gender predisposition, and the condition occurred over a wide range of ages (patients aged 4 days to 86 years). Cases occurred in many areas of the hospital, including outpatient clinics. One fatality and 3 near-fatalities were directly attributable to methemoglobinemia. Dapsone was the most common etiology of acquired methemoglobinemia, accounting for 42% of all cases. The mean peak methemoglobin level among these individuals was 7.6%. In 5 of the patients with the most severely elevated levels, 20% benzocaine spray (Hurricaine Topical Anesthetic spray, Beutlich Pharmaceuticals, Waukegan, IL) was the etiology, associated with a mean peak methemoglobin level of 43.8%. Eleven pediatric patients developed methemoglobinemia either from exogenous exposure, such as drugs, or due to serious illness, such as gastrointestinal infections with dehydration. Almost all (94%) patients with methemoglobinemia were anemic. Drugs that cause acquired methemoglobinemia are ubiquitous in both the hospital and the outpatient setting. Acquired methemoglobinemia is a treatable condition that causes significant morbidity and even mortality. We hope that a heightened awareness of methemoglobinemia will result in improved recognition and treatment. Primary prevention efforts have the potential to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with this condition.\n",
      "We report on a family in which 1 males infant who died neonatally and 1 female fetus at 29 weeks of gestation had an identical condition resembling Hallermann-Streiff syndrome. The long bones were slender with a few fractures, the skull was underossified, and the face was characteristic of Hallermann-Streiff syndrome. Bilateral cataracts were identified in the male. We regard the condition in this family as a severe form of Hallermann-Streiff syndrome, which appears to have been lethal, at least in the liveborn male. This syndrome is usually sporadic. Recurrence in sibs suggests the possibility of autosomal-recessive inheritance, or of a dominant mutation with parental mosaicism.\n",
      "Three patients from a large pedigree are described who had autosomal dominant spinal muscular atrophy that became manifest between the end of the fourth and the sixth decade. The disease progressed rapidly without evidence of corticospinal tract dysfunction, and within 3 years the patients died from respiratory failure.\n",
      "De novo monoallelic variants in NFIX cause two distinct syndromes. Whole gene deletions, nonsense variants and missense variants affecting the DNA-binding domain have been seen in association with a Sotos-like phenotype that we propose is referred to as Malan syndrome. Frameshift and splice-site variants thought to avoid nonsense-mediated RNA decay have been seen in Marshall-Smith syndrome. We report six additional patients with Malan syndrome and de novo NFIX deletions or sequence variants and review the 20 patients now reported. The phenotype is characterised by moderate postnatal overgrowth and macrocephaly. Median height and head circumference in childhood are 2.0 and 2.3 standard deviations (SD) above the mean, respectively. There is overlap of the facial phenotype with NSD1-positive Sotos syndrome in some cases including a prominent forehead, high anterior hairline, downslanting palpebral fissures and prominent chin. Neonatal feeding difficulties and/or hypotonia have been reported in 30% of patients. Developmental delay/learning disability have been reported in all cases and are typically moderate. Ocular phenotypes are common, including strabismus (65%), nystagmus (25% ) and optic disc pallor/hypoplasia (25%). Other recurrent features include pectus excavatum (40%) and scoliosis (25%). Eight reported patients have a deletion also encompassing CACNA1A, haploinsufficiency of which causes episodic ataxia type 2 or familial hemiplegic migraine. One previous case had episodic ataxia and one case we report has had cyclical vomiting responsive to pizotifen. In individuals with this contiguous gene deletion syndrome, awareness of possible later neurological manifestations is important, although their penetrance is not yet clear.\n",
      "We describe a Dutch kindred with a possibly novel dominant syndrome of premature loss of curly, brittle hair, premature loss of teeth due to caries, nail dystrophy and acral keratoderma. We discuss the possibility that this ectodermal dysplasia of group 1-2-3-4 is a variant of known disorders such as pachyonychia congenita. We conclude that none of these diagnoses fits the symptoms we observe in our patients and propose the name curly hair-acral keratoderma-caries syndrome in view of the most obvious abnormalities.\n",
      "Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2O (LGMD2O) belongs to a group of rare muscular dystrophies named dystroglycanopathies, which are characterized molecularly by hypoglycosylation of Œ±-dystroglycan (Œ±-DG). Here, we describe the first dystroglycanopathy patient carrying an alteration in the promoter region of the POMGNT1 gene (protein O-mannose Œ≤-1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 1), which involves a homozygous 9-bp duplication (-83_-75dup). Analysis of the downstream effects of this mutation revealed a decrease in the expression of POMGNT1 mRNA and protein because of negative regulation of the POMGNT1 promoter by the transcription factor ZNF202 (zinc-finger protein 202). By functional analysis of various luciferase constructs, we localized a proximal POMGNT1 promoter and we found a 75% decrease in luciferase activity in the mutant construct when compared with the wild type. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) revealed binding sites for the Sp1, Ets1 and GATA transcription factors. Surprisingly, the mutation generated an additional ZNF202 binding site and this transcriptional repressor bound strongly to the mutant promoter while failing to recognize the wild-type promoter. Although the genetic causes of dystroglycanopathies are highly variable, they account for only 50% of the cases described. Our results emphasize the importance of extending the mutational screening outside the gene-coding region in dystroglycanopathy patients of unknown aetiology, because mutations in noncoding regions may be the cause of disease. Our findings also underline the requirement to perform functional studies that may assist the interpretation of the pathogenic potential of promoter alterations.\n",
      "Cerebrofaciothoracic dysplasia (CFT) (OMIM #213980) is a multiple congenital anomaly and intellectual disability syndrome involving the cranium, face, and thorax. The characteristic features are cranial involvement with macrocrania at birth, brachycephaly, various CT/MRI findings including hypoplasia of corpus callosum, enlargement of septum pellicidum, and diffuse hypodensity of the grey matter, flat face, hypertelorism, cleft lip and cleft palate, low-set, posteriorly rotated ears, short neck, and multiple costal and vertebral anomalies. The underlying genetic defect remains unknown. Using combination of homozygosity mapping and whole-exome sequencing, we identified a homozygous nonsense founder mutation, p.Arg87Ter (c.259 C>T), in the human transmembrane and coiled-coil domains protein 1 (TMCO1) in four out of five families of Turkish origin. The entire critical region on chromosome 1q24 containing TMCO1 was excluded in the fifth family with characteristic findings of CFT providing evidence for genetic heterogeneity of CFT spectrum. Another founder TMCO1 mutation has recently been reported to cause a unique genetic condition, TMCO1-defect syndrome (OMIM #614132). TMCO1-defect syndrome shares many features with CFT. This study supports the fact that \"TMCO1-defect syndrome,\" initially thought to represent a distinct disorder, indeed belongs to the genetically heterogeneous CFT dysplasia spectrum.\n",
      "We present two male sibs with a series of malformations including microcephaly, mental retardation, congenital heart disease, skeletal abnormalities, micropenis, and mild hypothyroidism. Both have had seizures. While the pattern of abnormalities is similar to that previously reported in this journal as an unknown syndrome, the facies is clearly distinct, the hypothyroidism is mild, micropenis is present, and there are additional minor skeletal abnormalities.\n",
      "Diaphonospondylodysostosis (DSD) is a rare, recessively inherited, lethal skeletal dysplasia, characterized by severe spinal ossification, segmentation defects, and renal cystic dysplasia with nephrogenic rests. We hereby present three affected individuals: two children and a fetus from two unrelated East Jerusalem Arab-Muslim families. Whereas most fetuses die in utero or perinatally, one of the children survived to 15 months. Homozygosity mapping in the two families demonstrated a single common 3.87 Mb region on chromosome 7, ruling out previously known spondylocostal/spondylothoracic dysostosis loci. The 15 protein coding genes in the region were prioritized, and some were sequenced. A single, novel deleterious mutation, Q104X, was detected in the bone morphogenetic protein-binding endothelial regulator protein (BMPER) gene, recently reported to be mutated in other DSD patients [Funari et al., 2010]. The novel mutation we identified is an ancestral founder allele, as evidenced by a shared 440 SNP haplotype, and its frequency in the general Arab population is estimated to be <1:123. Our findings confirm loss of BMPER function as a cause of axial versus appendicular skeletal defects, and suggest that less deleterious mutations may be involved in milder axial skeleton abnormalities.\n",
      "Homocystinuria was studied in 27 patients from 15 families in New South Wales. All 2 had biochemical findings consistent with cystathionine synthetase deficiency. One patient was ascertained by newborn screening, but the remaining index cases were detected because of symptoms: poor eyesight 6, mental retardation 3, thromboses 2, skeletal abnormalities 2, and urinary infection1. 9 patients, one-third of all cases, were mildly affected: either they had no features of the disease, or these did not occur until the late teens. Pyridoxine responsiveness was found in 8 sibships, and clinically there were two distinct kinds of response. For patients born in the decade 1960-69 the ascertainment rate for the total population was 1:58 000. The true incidence must be much higher. Our series indicates that homocystinuria occurs more frequently than has heretofore been thought, and that mild cases are common. It is likely that cases are often missed in current newborn screening programmes.\n",
      "VATER association is a term frequently used to describe children with multiple malformations. However, occasionally these children have malformations that are not typical of VATER defects and may represent unique multiple malformation syndromes with specific prognoses and recurrence risks. Two siblings with a heretofore previously undescribed multiple malformation syndrome are presented whose features include vertebral defects, cardiac abnormalities, pulmonary hypertension, laryngeal webs, blue sclerae, and persistent growth deficiency. Autosomal recessive inheritance is suggested. These cases suggest that other individuals labeled VATER association with multiple other defects should be reviewed more closely to give accurate prognosis and recurrence risk information to families.\n",
      "We present male and female sibs of consanguineous parents with features including pili torti with unusual hair shaft electron microscopic (EM) findings, growth delay, developmental delay, and mild to moderate neurological abnormalities. The features of the cases presented here have not been noted in the previously reported clinical syndromes in which pili torti may be found.\n",
      "Inherited microcytic-hypochromic anemias in rodents and zebrafish suggest the existence of corresponding human disorders. The zebrafish mutant shiraz has severe anemia and is embryonically lethal because of glutaredoxin 5 (GRLX5) deletion, insufficient biogenesis of mitochondrial iron-sulfur (Fe/S) clusters, and deregulated iron-regulatory protein 1 (IRP1) activity. This leads to stabilization of transferrin receptor 1 (TfR) RNA, repression of ferritin, and ALA-synthase 2 (ALAS2) translation with impaired heme synthesis. We report the first case of GLRX5 deficiency in a middle-aged anemic male with iron overload and a low number of ringed sideroblasts. Anemia was worsened by blood transfusions but partially reversed by iron chelation. The patient had a homozygous (c.294A>G) mutation that interferes with intron 1 splicing and drastically reduces GLRX5 RNA. As in shiraz, aconitase and H-ferritin levels were low and TfR level was high in the patient's cells, compatible with increased IRP1 binding. Based on the biochemical and clinical phenotype, we hypothesize that IRP2, less degraded by low heme, contributes to the repression of the erythroblasts ferritin and ALAS2, increasing mitochondrial iron. Iron chelation, redistributing iron to the cytosol, might relieve IRP2 excess, improving heme synthesis and anemia. GLRX5 function is highly conserved, but at variance with zebrafish, its defect in humans leads to anemia and iron overload.\n",
      "Two patients are described with obesity, acanthosis nigricans, acral hypertrophy, basal hyperinsulinism and exaggerated insulin responses to oral glucose. One patient, a diabetic female showed features of virilisation due to polycystic ovarian disease and underwent gonadectomy with some resolution of her androgenisation and acanthosis nigricans. Binding of labelled insulin to erythrocytes was significantly decreased in both patients compared with normal or obese control subjects. In contrast, the receptor concentration in adipose tissue obtained from the patient undergoing gonadectomy was higher than seen in obese control subjects. Thus, somatic growth may be stimulated by insulin in some tissues in these hyperinsulinaemic patients due to relative preservation of receptor numbers.\n",
      "Curry-Jones syndrome (OMIM #601707) is a rare multiple malformation disorder of unknown etiology, associated with brain and skull abnormalities, polysyndactyly, and defects of the eyes, skin and gastrointestinal tract. We report on two new cases of Curry-Jones syndrome with previously unreported features, including benign and malignant neoplasms. The first patient had typical features of Curry-Jones syndrome as well as multiple intra-abdominal smooth muscle hamartomas and trichoblastoma of the skin. The second patient was born with occipital meningoceles and developed a desmoplastic medulloblastoma. Routine lymphocyte karyotype, GLI3 gene analysis and Patched (PTCH) gene analysis on both patients and chromosome microarray analysis on the first patient were normal. We review the previously reported cases of Curry-Jones syndrome and compare our patients' findings. In view of the association of trichoblastoma with basal cell carcinoma and desmoplastic medulloblastoma with nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS) and PTCH mutations, we hypothesize that Curry-Jones syndrome is caused by malfunction of an element in the sonic hedgehog pathway.\n",
      "Splenogonadal fusion usually presents as a left scrotal mass but rarely is the diagnosis suspected preoperatively. Herein, we present the first report of a left splenogonadal fusion which was suspected preoperatively by doppler ultrasonography in a 2 year old boy.\n",
      "This paper describes odontomicronychial dysplasia, a pure ectodermal dysplasia of the 2-3 subgroup of group A. It is characterised by precocious eruption and shedding of deciduous dentition, precocious eruption of secondary dentition with short, rhomboid roots, and short, thin, slow growing nails. This condition probably results from an autosomal recessive gene.\n",
      "Infantile myositis is an inflammatory myopathy occurring in children under one year of age. This condition is extremely rare in the neonatal period and may be confused with other causes of generalized weakness. Creatine kinase activity is usually markedly elevated and electromyography demonstrates low amplitude, polyphasic motor unit activity. Muscle biopsy, necessary for diagnosis, documents characteristic findings of perifascicular atrophy and the presence of perivascular inflammatory cells. The diagnosis should be followed by corticosteroid treatment. The patient presented is the youngest biopsy-proved case of infantile myositis. In this report, his symptoms and clinical course are compared with those of previously described patients. The role of infectious agents and the immune state in the etiology of infantile myositis is considered.\n",
      "We describe a new case of Say syndrome. This syndrome is an autosomal dominant condition characterized by cleft palate, short stature of prenatal onset, large protruding ears and microcephaly, delayed bone age, and renal anomalies. The first report was in 1975 by Say et al. in three generations of a family. Three additional reports of isolated cases were published. Our propositus is a 12-month-old boy with the cardinal signs of the syndrome whose mother has only microcephaly. To our knowledge this is the second familial report with evidence of highly variable expressivity. The occurrence of renal anomalies in a son of a normal sister of his mother suggests incomplete penetrance.\n",
      "Painful peripheral neuropathy often occurs without apparent underlying cause. Gain-of-function variants of sodium channel Na(v)1.7 have recently been found in √¢ÀÜ¬º30% of cases of idiopathic painful small-fiber neuropathy. Here, we describe mutations in Na(v)1.8, another sodium channel that is specifically expressed in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons and peripheral nerve axons, in patients with painful neuropathy. Seven Na(v)1.8 mutations were identified in 9 subjects within a series of 104 patients with painful predominantly small-fiber neuropathy. Three mutations met criteria for potential pathogenicity based on predictive algorithms and were assessed by voltage and current clamp. Functional profiling showed that two of these three Na(v)1.8 mutations enhance the channel's response to depolarization and produce hyperexcitability in DRG neurons. These observations suggest that mutations of Na(v)1.8 contribute to painful peripheral neuropathy.\n",
      "During the last few years, an increasing number of microdeletion/microduplication syndromes have been delineated. This rapid evolution is mainly due to the availability of microarray technology as a routine diagnostic tool. Microdeletions of the 21q22.11q22.12 region encompassing the RUNX1 gene have been reported in nine patients presenting with syndromic thrombocytopenia and mental retardation. RUNX1 gene is responsible for an autosomal dominant platelet disorder with predisposition to acute myelogenous leukemia. We report on three novel patients with an overlapping \"de novo\" interstitial deletion involving the band 21q22 characterized by array-CGH. All our patients presented with severe developmental delay, dysmorphic features, behavioral problems, and thrombocytopenia. Comparing the clinical features of our patients with the overlapping ones already reported two potential phenotypes related to 21q22 microdeletion including RUNX1 were highlighted: thrombocytopenia with +/- mild dysmorphic features and syndromic thrombocytopenia with growth and developmental delay.\n",
      "This report describes a probably new syndrome seen in a brother and sister and characterized by joint laxity, pectus carinatum and a peculiar face with mild frontal bossing, low nasal bridge, lateral displacement of the inner malar hypoplasia, parrot-like nose, chubby cheeks, striking philtrum and arched upper lips.\n",
      "3-methylglutaconic aciduria (3-MGA-uria) is a nonspecific finding associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, including defects of oxidative phosphorylation. 3-MGA-uria is classified into five groups, of which one, type IV, is genetically heterogeneous. Here we report five children with a form of type IV 3-MGA-uria characterized by cataracts, severe psychomotor regression during febrile episodes, epilepsy, neutropenia with frequent infections, and death in early childhood. Four of the individuals were of Greenlandic descent, and one was North American, of Northern European and Asian descent. Through a combination of homozygosity mapping in the Greenlandic individuals and exome sequencing in the North American, we identified biallelic variants in the caseinolytic peptidase B homolog (CLPB). The causative variants included one missense variant, c.803C>T (p.Thr268Met), and two nonsense variants, c.961A>T (p.Lys321*) and c.1249C>T (p.Arg417*). The level of CLPB protein was markedly decreased in fibroblasts and liver of affected individuals. CLPB is proposed to function as a mitochondrial chaperone involved in disaggregation of misfolded proteins, resulting from stress such as heat denaturation.\n",
      "The neuronal migration disorders comprise several morphological entities that are recognizable during life using current imaging techniques. We studied 4 patients who had a characteristic bilateral central rolandic and sylvian macrogyria. The patients had pseudobulbar palsy with oromotor incoordination and developmental delay and were mildly retarded. Minor seizures developed between the ages of 8 and 9 years. Subsequently, atonic drop attacks became the predominant epileptic pattern. Epileptogenic electrographic abnormalities were secondary generalized or multifocal. The lesions were detected by computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging in all patients. Bilateral symmetrical areas of thick cortex surrounding a large sulcus were seen. This syndrome consists of specific clinical, imaging, electroencephalographic, and epileptic features. It can be suspected clinically and confirmed by imaging studies. Callosotomy in two patients helped the intractable seizures.\n",
      "Leiomyoma are slowly growing lesions arising from smooth muscle. Orbital location has been reported in 25 cases. Histological findings and no recurrence after total resection support their benign behaviour. We report an intraconal orbital haemangioleiomyoma in a 55-year-old female treated by total resection through fronto-orbital craniotomy, with no recurrence after 15 months of follow-up. Radiological and pathological features are discussed, emphasising the prognostic role of the surgery.\n",
      "Stuve Wiedemann syndrome (SWS) is an autosomal recessively inherited syndrome which is characterized by bowing of the long bones, camptodactyly, facial dysmorphism, hypotonia, feeding and swallowing difficulties, and respiratory distress. In most cases episodes of unexplained hyperthermia are present. Patients with SWS can develop hyperthermia in conjunction with anesthesia and surgery, and a relationship has been suggested between the syndrome and malignant hyperthermia. We describe a 3-year-old child diagnosed with SWS to whom we administered general anesthesia during the removal of a corneal ulcer and dilatation of the lacrimal duct. Our patient had received, uncomplicated, inhalational anesthesia five times previously for different operations. There were no anesthesia-related complications in the present or previous perioperative periods. On one occasion the patient developed mild postoperative hyperthermia. We believe that this hyperthermia is different from the specific disorder of malignant hyperthermia and that sevoflurane can be safely used in patients with SWS. We also describe symptomatically related syndromes and their theoretical risks for anesthesia.\n",
      "A Jewish family is reported in which the proband and her father had congenital hearing loss and unusual facies consisting of facial asymmetry, temporal alopecia with frontal bossing, a broad nasal root and small nasal alae. In addition, both were born with a short frenulum of the tongue. We believe these findings represent a new autosomal dominant deafness syndrome with distinct craniofacial features.\n",
      "Five children, three sisters and two brothers aged between three months and 12 years, are described. They all developed a facial desquamating rash of butterfly distribution at the age of about two months, and motor retardation which later was characterized by spasticity, predominantly affecting the lower limbs. The three children who were old enough for speech to be tested had dysarthria. There was no family history of neurological disease, nor was there consanguinity among the parents or grandparents. EEGs were diffusely abnormal in four of the five children, but did not show any specific or diagnostic features. Plasma immunoglobulin tests were normal, and tests for collagen disease were negative. The authors are not aware of previous reports of this condition, but believe that it is a variant of familial spastic paraplegia, with atypical features.\n",
      "We describe the phenotypes of two male sibs with partial monosomy of chromosome 5 [46,XY,der(5)inv ins(1;5)(p32;q35.4q34)]; maternally derived from a balanced insertion of 1 and 5 [inv ins (1;5)(p.32;q35.4q34)]. One sib had microcephaly, cleft lip and palate, facial anomalies, atrial (ASD) and ventricular (VSD) septal defects, camptodactyly 4th and 5th fingers, and developmental delay. The other sib showed microcephaly, facial anomalies, ASD, hypotonia, primary optic nerve hypoplasia, and developmental delay. Only seven other patients with 5q deletions distal to 5q33 have been reported and none showed the putative breakpoints identified in our two patients. All nine showed developmental delay or malformations of the CNS and facial anomalies; six of nine had defects of cardiac septation. Our two patients and one other were shown to have only one copy of the cardiac specific hCSX gene that defines in part the etiology of their ASD and VSD. The other components of their phenotypes cannot be related at present to genes identified in the deleted segments.\n",
      "We describe two unrelated boys with bilateral fibula aplasia, poly- and oligodactyly, and bowed tibiae in two non-consanguineous Brazilian families. These cases are similar to those reported by Fuhrman et al. [(1980). Skeletal Dysplasias. New York: Alan R. Liss Inc. pp. 519-524].\n",
      "Trm10 is a tRNA m(1)G9 methyltransferase, which in yeast modifies 12 different tRNA species, yet is considered non-essential for viability under standard growth conditions. In humans, there are three Trm10 orthologs, one mitochondrial and two presumed cytoplasmic. A nonsense mutation in one of the cytoplasmic orthologs (TRMT10A) has recently been associated with microcephaly, intellectual disability, short stature and adolescent onset diabetes.The subjects were three patients who suffered from microcephaly, intellectual disability, short stature, delayed puberty, seizures and disturbed glucose metabolism, mainly hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia. A homozygous Gly206Arg (G206R) mutation in the TRMT10A gene was identified using whole exome sequencing. The mutation segregated in the family and was absent from large control cohorts. Determination of the methylation activity of the expressed wild-type (WT) and variant TRMT10A enzymes with transcripts of (32)P -tRNA(Gly) GCC as a substrate revealed a striking defect (<0.1% of WT activity) for the variant enzyme. The binding affinity of the G206R variant enzyme to tRNA, determined by fluorescence anisotropy, was similar to that of the WT enzyme.The completely abolished m(1)G9 methyltransferase activity of the mutant enzyme is likely due to significant defects in its ability to bind the methyl donor S-adenosyl methionine. We propose that TRMT10A deficiency accounts for abnormalities in glucose homeostasis initially manifesting both ketotic and non-ketotic hypoglycaemic events with transition to diabetes in adolescence, perhaps as a consequence of accelerated √é¬≤ cell apoptosis. The seizure disorder and intellectual disability are probably secondary to mutant gene expression in neuronal tissue.\n",
      "We report on two unrelated cases born to nonconsanguineous parents with a similar clinical presentation: hypotonia since the neonatal period, severe failure to thrive, postnatal growth retardation, facial dysmorphism, congenital cardiac defects (septal defect and non progressive multiple valve dysplasia), shortened extremities, carpal/tarsal and extensive vertebral synostosis, delayed carpal bone age, deafness, and inner ear malformations. Presently, both patients present with normal psychomotor development. Additional abnormal findings include extra oral frenulum, nasal speech, and vesico-ureteral reflux. Molecular analysis in one patient excluded the Noggin gene and Filamin B (FLNB) was excluded in the other patient. Although some features are similar to spondylocarpotarsal synostosis syndrome, the exclusion of FLNB and this constellation of findings suggest a new entity, closely similar to an autosomal dominant condition reported by Forney et al. 1966 in a unique family. Identification of similarly affected patients should aid in the further elucidation of this syndrome.\n",
      "Leukodystrophies are genetic white matter disorders affecting the formation or maintenance of myelin. Among the recently discovered genetic defects associated with leukodystrophies, several genes converge on a common mechanism involving protein transcription/translation and ER stress response.The genetic basis of a novel congenital leukodystrophy, associated with early onset spastic paraparesis, acquired microcephaly and optic atrophy was studied in six patients from three unrelated Ashkenazi-Jewish families. To this end we used homozygosity mapping, exome analysis, western blot (Hikeshi, HSF1-pS326 and b-actin) in patient fibroblasts, indirect immunofluorescence (HSP70 and HSF1) in patient fibroblasts undergoing heat shock stress, nuclear injection of plasmids expressing Hikeshi or EGFP in patient fibroblasts, in situ hybridization and Immunoblot analysis of Hikeshi in newborn and adult mouse brain.All the patients were homozygous for a missense mutation, p.Val54Leu, in C11ORF73 encoding HSP70 nuclear transporter protein, Hikeshi. The mutation segregated with the disease in the families and was carried by 1:200 Ashkenazi-Jewish individuals. The mutation was associated with undetectable level of Hikeshi in the patients' fibroblasts and with lack of nuclear HSP70 during heat shock stress, a phenomenon which was reversed upon the introduction of normal human Hikeshi to the patients cells. Hikeshi was found to be expressed in central white matter of mouse brain.These data underscore the importance of Hikeshi for HSP70 relocation into the nucleus. It is likely that in the absence of Hikeshi, HSP70 cannot attenuate the multiple heat shock induced nuclear phenotypes, leaving the cells unprotected during heat shock stress. We speculate that the sudden death of three of the six patients following a short febrile illness and the life-threatening myo-pericarditis in the fourth are the result of excess extra-nuclear HSP70 level which initiates cytokine release or provide target for natural killer cells. Alternatively, nuclear HSP70 might play an active role in stressed cells protection.\n",
      "3-hydroxyisobutryl-CoA hydrolase (HIBCH) deficiency is a rare inborn error of valine metabolism characterized by neurodegenerative symptoms and caused by recessive mutations in the HIBCH gene. In this study, utilizing whole exome sequencing, we identified two novel splicing mutations of HIBCH (c.304+3A>G; c.1010_1011+3delTGGTA) in a Chinese patient with characterized neurodegenerative features of HIBCH deficiency and bilateral syndactyly which was not reported in previous studies. Functional tests showed that both of these two mutations destroyed the normal splicing and reduced the expression of HIBCH protein. Through a literature review, a potential phenotype-genotype correlation was found that patients carrying truncating mutations tended to have more severe phenotypes compared with those with missense mutations. Our findings would widen the mutation spectrum of HIBCH causing HIBCH deficiency and the phenotypic spectrum of the disease. The potential genotype-phenotype correlation would be profitable for the treatment and management of patients with HIBCH deficiency.\n",
      "Gain-of-function mutations in LRP5 have been shown to cause high BMD disorders showing variable expression of some clinical symptoms, including torus palatinus and neurological complications. In an extended family, we were able to add craniosynostosis and developmental delay to the clinical spectrum associated with LRP5 mutations. We report on an extended four-generation family with 13 affected individuals (7 men and 6 women) in which an autosomal dominant type of osteosclerosis segregates. Osteosclerosis was most pronounced in the cranial base and calvarium, starting in early childhood with variable expression and a progressive character. Craniosynostosis at an early age was reported in four affected family members (two males and two females). The patients also presented with dysmorphic features (macrocephaly, brachycephaly, wide and high forehead, hypertelorism, prominent cheekbones, prominent jaw). They have normal height and proportions. Neurological complications like entrapment of cranial nerves resulting in optical nerve atrophy, hearing loss, and facial palsy were reported in two individuals. A mild developmental delay was reported in three affected individuals. None of the patients have torus palatinus, increased rate of fractures, osteomyelitis, hepatosplenomegaly, or pancytopenia. A missense mutation 640G-->A (A214T) in the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5) gene was found in all affected individuals analyzed, including cases in whom craniosynostosis, a mild developmental delay, and/or macrocephaly is observed. To our knowledge, this is the first report in the literature of patients presenting with autosomal dominant osteosclerosis in whom a variable expression of craniosynostosis, macrocephaly, and mild developmental delay is observed, which is most likely associated with a mutation in the LRP5 gene. These phenotypes can therefore be added to the clinical spectrum of LRP5-associated bone disorders.\n",
      "We report on six patients with clinical findings consisting of (1) Capillary malformation (CM) of the lower lip; (2) Lymphatic malformation (LM) of the face/neck; (3) Asymmetry of face and limbs, and (4) Partial/generalized Overgrowth. This constellation of findings has been observed in six unrelated patients, constituting a likely \"new\" syndrome/association of capillary-lymphatic-venous malformation and asymmetric overgrowth.\n",
      "There is a significant level of genetic heterogeneity underlying the phenotype of nonspecific hypotonia with severe intellectual disability. Exome sequencing has proven to be a powerful tool for identifying the underlying molecular basis of such nonspecific, abnormal neurological phenotypes. Mutations in the TBCK gene have been reported associated with very poor, if any, psychomotor development, poor speech, and inability to walk independently. We describe the long-term phenotypic evolution of a severe nonspecific neurodevelopmental disorder in two siblings born to an Arab-Moslem family living in northern Israel. Exome sequencing led to identification of a novel homozygous mutation: c.1854delT in the TBCK gene. Abnormal elevated Œ≤-HCG was found in the maternal serum during the two pregnancies, a finding that has not been reported before. These individuals present with severe intellectual disability, no speech, hypotonia, convulsions, and lack of any independent daily skills. ¬© 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\n",
      "Three patients with postaxial polydactyly and other abnormalities of the hands and feet, hypoplasia and fusion of the vertebral bodies, and dental abnormalities are reported. Two were sisters born to normal unrelated parents; the other patient was the male offspring of a consanguineous marriage. We suggest that this constellation of abnormalities represents a recessively inherited syndrome.\n",
      "We present three patients with congenital generalized lipodystrophy, sensorineural deafness, low birth weight, short stature, delayed cognitive development, and progressive bone changes characterized by overtubulation and rarefaction of long bones with dense metaphyseal striations occurring in adolescence. Abnormalities of lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, hepatosplenomegaly, acanthosis nigricans, and hirsutism were not found. Comparison of the condition of these patients with known syndromic lipodystrophies suggests that they represent a previously unrecognized genetic disorder. The occurrence in sibs born to consanguineous parents and a third patient from the same tribal unit suggest autosomal recessive inheritance.\n",
      "We report on three members of a Brazilian family with distal arthrogryposis type II D. This autosomal dominant trait was described by Hall et al [1982] and is characterized by scoliosis without associated vertebral anomalies and distal contractures. To the best of our knowledge, this family is the second literature report of distal arthrogryposis type II D.\n",
      "The introduction of whole-exome sequencing into the Pediatric Genetics clinic has increased the identification of novel genes associated with neurodevelopmental disorders and congenital anomalies. This agnostic approach has shed light on multiple proteins and pathways not previously known to be associated with disease. Here we report eight subjects from six families with predicted loss of function variants in ZNF462, a zinc-finger protein of unknown function. These individuals have overlapping phenotypes that include ptosis, metopic ridging, craniosynostosis, dysgenesis of the corpus callosum, and developmental delay. We propose that ZNF462 plays an important role in embryonic development, and is associated with craniofacial and neurodevelopmental abnormalities.\n",
      "Two sisters presented with partial alopecia, primary hypergonadotropic hypogonadism and Mullerian hypoplasia associated with mild mental retardation, microcephaly, flat occiput, sparse eyebrows, absence of breast tissue, absent ovaries, mild-moderate dorsal kyphosis, thin upper lip and unilateral sensorioneural deafness in one of them. They were the product of a Turkish consanguineous marriage. The clinical course for our patients is similar to two families reported by Al-Awadi et al. [Al-Awadi et al. (1985) Am J Med Genet 22:619-622] and Megarbane et al. [Megarbane et al. (2003) Am J Med Genet Part A 119A:214-217]. This report supports the literature by proposing an autosomal recessive syndrome which was firstly reported by Al-Awadi et al. [Al-Awadi et al. (1985) Am J Med Genet 22:619-622]. This condition may be due to a founder mutation.\n",
      "We report on a young girl with polysyndactyly, coarctation of the aorta, and tongue hamartomas. These features are similar to those reported in individuals with variant forms of orofaciodigital syndrome known as congenital heart defects, hamartomas of the tongue and polysyndactly (CHDHTP: OMIM 217085) [√ñrstavik et al., 1992] and orocardiodigital syndrome [Digilio et al., 1996]. Whole exome sequencing revealed that she is a compound heterozygote for a frame shift mutation and a likely pathogenic sequence variant in WDPCP, a gene that regulates planar cell polarity and ciliogenesis. Results of genotyping in her parents and unaffected siblings were consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance of the mutation and the WDPCP variant. These results suggest that disruption of planar cell polarity and ciliogenesis may result in this unusual form of orofaciodigital syndrome.\n",
      "Kaposi sarcoma (KS), a human herpes virus 8 (HHV-8; also called KSHV)-induced endothelial tumor, develops only in a small fraction of individuals infected with HHV-8. We hypothesized that inborn errors of immunity to HHV-8 might underlie the exceedingly rare development of classic KS in childhood. We report here autosomal recessive OX40 deficiency in an otherwise healthy adult with childhood-onset classic KS. OX40 is a co-stimulatory receptor expressed on activated T cells. Its ligand, OX40L, is expressed on various cell types, including endothelial cells. We found OX40L was abundantly expressed in KS lesions. The mutant OX40 protein was poorly expressed on the cell surface and failed to bind OX40L, resulting in complete functional OX40 deficiency. The patient had a low proportion of effector memory CD4(+) T cells in the peripheral blood, consistent with impaired CD4(+) T cell responses to recall antigens in vitro. The proportion of effector memory CD8(+) T cells was less diminished. The proportion of circulating memory B cells was low, but the antibody response in vivo was intact, including the response to a vaccine boost. Together, these findings suggest that human OX40 is necessary for robust CD4(+) T cell memory and confers apparently selective protective immunity against HHV-8 infection in endothelial cells.\n",
      "We describe four patients, from four different families, affected by a mild myopathy or asymptomatic elevated serum creatine kinase levels, in whom toluidine blue-stained semithin sections of muscle specimens revealed inclusions of different size and shape. The inclusions did not stain by routine histochemical studies. The sarcoplasmic or endoplasmic reticulum calcium 1 (SERCA1) ATPase and/or calsequestrin reactivity of inclusions, by immunohistochemistry, and the SERCA1- and calsequestrin-increased expression, by immunoblot, suggested that inclusions were constituted by an excess of proteins normally present in the terminal cisternae of sarcoplasmic reticulum. Our cases, both sporadic and familial, represent a new type of surplus protein myopathy.\n",
      "The protein MSTO1 has been localized to mitochondria and linked to mitochondrial morphology, but its specific role has remained unclear. We identified a c.22G¬†>¬†A (p.Val8Met) mutation of MSTO1 in patients with minor physical abnormalities, myopathy, ataxia, and neurodevelopmental impairments. Lactate stress test and myopathological results suggest mitochondrial dysfunction. In patient fibroblasts, MSTO1 mRNA and protein abundance are decreased, mitochondria display fragmentation, aggregation, and decreased network continuity and fusion activity. These characteristics can be reversed by genetic rescue. Short-term silencing of MSTO1 in HeLa cells reproduced the impairment of mitochondrial morphology and dynamics observed in the fibroblasts without damaging bioenergetics. At variance with a previous report, we find MSTO1 to be localized in the cytoplasmic area with limited colocalization with mitochondria. MSTO1 interacts with the fusion machinery as a soluble factor at the cytoplasm-mitochondrial outer membrane interface. After plasma membrane permeabilization, MSTO1 is released from the cells. Thus, an MSTO1 loss-of-function mutation is associated with a human disorder showing mitochondrial involvement. MSTO1 likely has a physiologically relevant role in mitochondrial morphogenesis by supporting mitochondrial fusion.\n",
      "Hypertrichosis cubiti (HC) or hairy elbow syndrome (OMIM # 139600) consists of a localised form of long vellus hair on the extensor surfaces of the distal third of the upper arm and the proximal third of the forearm bilaterally, or occasionally on other parts of the body. In the 28 cases reported in the literature so far the elbow hair abnormality was either isolated or associated with short stature or other physical abnormalities. Most of these cases were sporadic, but autosomal dominant as well as autosomal recessive inheritance patterns have been postulated. We report on three unrelated girls (aged 7 to 11 years) of whom one presented with excess hair in the elbows alone and the other two had associated abnormalities including short stature, dysmorphic facial features and mental retardation. The literature on this subject has been reviewed and the authors focus on cases of HC with associated anomalies. A pathogenic explanation by somatic mosaicism is proposed.\n",
      "The palmoplantar keratodermas (PPKs) are a large group of genodermatoses comprising nearly 60 genetically distinct diseases. They are characterized by hyperkeratosis on the palms and soles with or without extrapalmoplantar hyperkeratotic lesions. Focal PPK is one of the hallmarks of pachyonychia congenita, a rare autosomal dominant disorder resulting from mutations in the keratin genes KRT6A, KRT6B, KRT16 or KRT17. Recently, in-frame deletion mutations of KRT6C have been identified in three families with focal PPK with slight or no nail changes. We report here a novel KRT6C mutation identified in a Japanese family with PPK with phenotypic heterogeneity, presenting with not only focal but also diffuse hyperkeratosis. The proband had diffuse hyperkeratosis on the soles and small focal hyperkeratoses on the palms, while the two other affected individuals showed focal hyperkeratoses on the soles. All three patients were heterozygotes for c.1414G>A in KRT6C, predicted to result in p.Glu472Lys. These findings strongly suggest that screening of patients with nonepidermolytic diffuse PPK, in whom the pathogenic mutations are yet to be determined, might identify mutations in KRT6C.\n",
      "MEDNIK syndrome-acronym for mental retardation, enteropathy, deafness, neuropathy, ichthyosis, keratodermia-is caused by AP1S1 gene mutations, encoding œÉ1A, the small subunit of the adaptor protein 1 complex, which plays a crucial role in clathrin coat assembly and mediates trafficking between trans-Golgi network, endosomes and the plasma membrane. MEDNIK syndrome was first reported in a few French-Canadian families sharing common ancestors, presenting a complex neurocutaneous phenotype, but its pathogenesis is not completely understood. A Sephardic-Jewish patient, carrying a new AP1S1 homozygous mutation, showed severe perturbations of copper metabolism with hypocupremia, hypoceruloplasminemia and liver copper accumulation, along with intrahepatic cholestasis. Zinc acetate treatment strikingly improved clinical conditions, as well as liver copper and bile-acid overload. We evaluated copper-related metabolites and liver function retrospectively in the original French-Canadian patient series. Intracellular copper metabolism and subcellular localization and function of copper pump ATP7A were investigated in patient fibroblasts. Copper metabolism perturbation and hepatopathy were confirmed in all patients. Studies in mutant fibroblasts showed abnormal copper incorporation and retention, reduced expression of copper-dependent enzymes cytochrome-c-oxidase and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase, and aberrant intracellular trafficking of Menkes protein ATP7A, which normalized after rescue experiments expressing wild-type AP1S1 gene. We solved the pathogenetic mechanism of MEDNIK syndrome, demonstrating that AP1S1 regulates intracellular copper machinery mediated by copper-pump proteins. This multisystem disease is characterized by a unique picture, combining clinical and biochemical signs of both Menkes and Wilson's diseases, in which liver copper overload is treatable by zinc acetate therapy, and can now be listed as a copper metabolism defect in humans. Our results may also contribute to understand the mechanism(s) of intracellular trafficking of copper pumps.\n",
      "We present two patients with a distinct facial phenotype, short stature, brachydactyly, clubfoot deformities, cataracts, microcephaly, and normal intelligence. Similar radiographic abnormalities of the spine, long bones, hands, and feet were noted. These patients are similar to 2 males previously described by Saul and Wilson [1990: Am J Med Genet 35:388-393]. These 4 patients appear to have a unique skeletal dysplasia characterized by microcephaly, distinct facial phenotype, multisystem abnormalities, and short stature of postnatal onset.\n",
      "A family with an X-linked mental retardation syndrome involving seven children in two generations is reported. The syndrome includes microcephaly, severe mental retardation, optic atrophy with severely impaired vision or blindness, a severe hearing defect, spasticity, epileptic seizures, restricted movement of the large joints, and death in infancy or early childhood. We conclude that this is a distinct, previously unrecognized X-linked mental retardation syndrome.\n",
      "Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4J (CMT4J), a rare form of demyelinating CMT, caused by recessive mutations in the phosphoinositide phosphatase FIG4 gene, is characterised by progressive proximal and distal weakness and evidence of chronic denervation in both proximal and distal muscles. We describe a patient with a previous diagnosis of CMT1 who presented with a two year history of rapidly progressive weakness in a single limb, resembling an acquired inflammatory neuropathy. Nerve conduction studies showed an asymmetrical demyelinating neuropathy with conduction block and temporal dispersion. FIG4 sequencing identified a compound heterozygous I41T/K278YfsX5 genotype. CMT4J secondary to FIG4 mutations should be added to the list of inherited neuropathies that need to be considered in suspected cases of inflammatory demyelinating neuropathy, especially if there is a background history of a more slowly progressive neuropathy.\n",
      "Filamin A (FLNA) is known to be involved in intracellular actin binding, cell migration, scaffolding, and signaling. We report a novel X-linked syndrome characterized by cardiac valvular disease, keloid scarring and reduced joint mobility in male second cousins due to a previously unreported mutation in FLNA. Whole exome sequencing was performed using standard methods and segregation analysis was performed in affected and non-affected family members. A novel hemizygous c.4726G>A (p.G1576R) mutation in FLNA was detected. Segregation analysis performed on multiple maternal family members showed c.4726G>A (p.G1576R) segregated with disease in an X-linked inheritance pattern. The findings in these cases are distinct from previously described FLNA related disorders by virtue of decreased joint mobility and spontaneous keloid scarring. They occur in association with a novel mutation and represent a novel genetic syndrome.\n",
      "The association of Hypertelorism, Microtia and Cleft lip and palate (HMC syndrome, MIM 239800) is a rare condition of autosomal recessive inheritance. A total of seven cases of HMC syndrome in five families have been hitherto reported. Here, we report two unrelated cases and put emphasis on the possible normal psychomotor development in this syndrome.\n",
      "We report on the syndromic occurrence of the Fallot complex in sibs born to consanguineous Pakistani parents. Additional manifestations included minor facial anomalies, pronounced failure to thrive, and mental retardation. Expression of the syndrome varied. While one of the four patients had cardiac malformations, another sib had only non-cardiac manifestations. The clinical findings suggest a new autosomal recessive syndrome.\n",
      "Non-consanguineous healthy parents had 2 boys with severe, non-spherocytic, nonimmune hemolytic anemia, abnormalities of their external genitalia, flat occiput, dimpled earlobes, deep plantar creases, and increased space between their first and second toes. The birth of these children was separated by a spontaneous abortion at 3 months and delivery of a normal girl. We propose that these boys have a heretofore undescribed autosomal or X-linked recessive syndrome.\n",
      "Familial dyskinesia with facial myokymia (FDFM) is an autosomal dominant disorder that is exacerbated by anxiety. In a 5-generation family of German ancestry, we previously mapped FDFM to chromosome band 3p21-3q21. The 72.5-Mb linkage region was too large for traditional positional mutation identification.To identify the gene responsible for FDFM by exome resequencing of a single affected individual.We performed whole exome sequencing in 1 affected individual and used a series of bioinformatic filters, including functional significance and presence in dbSNP or the 1000 Genomes Project, to reduce the number of candidate variants. Co-segregation analysis was performed in 15 additional individuals in 3 generations.Unique DNA variants in the linkage region that co-segregate with FDFM.The exome contained 23 428 single-nucleotide variants, of which 9391 were missense, nonsense, or splice site alterations. The critical region contained 323 variants, 5 of which were not present in 1 of the sequence databases. Adenylyl cyclase 5 (ADCY5) was the only gene in which the variant (c.2176G>A) was co-transmitted perfectly with disease status and was not present in 3510 control white exomes. This residue is highly conserved, and the change is nonconservative and predicted to be damaging.ADCY5 is highly expressed in striatum. Mice deficient in Adcy5 develop a movement disorder that is worsened by stress. We conclude that FDFM likely results from a missense mutation in ADCY5. This study demonstrates the power of a single exome sequence combined with linkage information to identify causative genes for rare autosomal dominant mendelian diseases.\n",
      "PURPOSE:Posterior amorphous corneal dysgenesis is a rare disorder previously described in only four families. We expanded the spectrum of findings and updated the classification by adding seven additional cases. METHODS:Three index cases were identified during ophthalmic examination at the El Maghraby Eye Hospital and Eye Center in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. We examined all available members of three families of different ethnic origin (Saudi Arabian, Egyptian, and Indian) and found seven cases of affected patients. Videokeratography and slit-lamp photomicrography were done in selected cases. RESULTS:In all seven cases, the corneas showed bilateral, diffuse, sheetlike opacities in the posterior stroma, with extension to the corneoscleral limbus, and corneal thinning in the more severely affected eyes. The clinical findings included variations in corneal thickness noted by slit-lamp microscopy and ultrasonic pachymetry, cornea plana, marked corneal astigmatism, and progressive ectasia of the cornea. CONCLUSIONS:Posterior amorphous corneal dysgenesis is characterized by gray sheetlike opacities in the posterior stroma. It occurs in many ethnic groups and exhibits a varied spectrum of clinical findings, including iridocorneal adhesions and cornea plana. We think the anatomic abnormalities of the cornea warrant classification as a corneal dysgenesis rather than as a dystrophy. Longitudinal studies of individual eyes and investigation of associated abnormalities in other pedigrees may help resolve this distinction.\n",
      "We report on two patients with a unique constellation of anomalies resembling the Nager acrofacial dysostosis syndrome. Clinical manifestations which differentiate their condition from Nager syndrome include: microcephaly, cleft lip and palate, a peculiar beaked nose, blepharophimosis, microtia, symmetrical involvement of the thumbs, and great toes and developmental delay. We postulate that the inheritance is autosomal recessive on the basis of similarly affected male and female sibs.\n",
      "A young Caucasian male, otherwise healthy, had had generalized anhidrosis since early childhood. During heat stress tests (40 degrees C, 40% relative humidity), he was found to be heat intolerant since sweat was not apparent. His reaction to muscarinic stimulation of sweat glands was 10% of normal. On biopsy, the sweat glands were morphologically intact, and function of his cardiovascular autonomic responses was normal. The patient's mother reported reduced sweating and her response to muscarinic stimulation was 50% of normal, but his father and both sisters sweated normally. The data suggest a post-ganglionic defect, which may be genetic. To our knowledge this is the first reported case of familial generalized anhidrosis without anatomopathological lesions affecting sweat glands.\n",
      "We present a sibship with a rare syndrome characterized by mental retardation, dense calcification of the lateral ventricular choroid plexus, and increased CSF protein. Neurophysiologic studies yielded nonspecific results, and endocrine studies, including parathormone levels, were normal. Simultaneous measurements of CSF and serum calcium, magnesium, and other electrolytes were normal, but the CSF/serum ratio of phosphate was low, suggesting a possible role in the pathogenesis of this syndrome.\n",
      "Amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) is a group of hereditary disorders that affect the quality and/or quantity of dental enamel. This paper describes the clinicopathological features of a patient who was born of consanguineous parents and who presented with oral alterations, including yellow and misshapen teeth, intrapulpal calcifications, delayed tooth eruption, and gum enlargement. Scanning electron microscopy of the teeth revealed hypoplastic enamel, and a renal ultrasound detected bilateral nephrocalcinosis, leading to a diagnosis of AI and nephrocalcinosis syndrome. Since nephrocalcinosis is often asymptomatic and can be associated with impaired renal function, dentists who see children with generalized and thin hypoplastic AI should consider a renal ultrasound scan and referral to a nephrologist, if appropriate. Children with nephrocalcinosis should also be considered for a dental check.\n",
      "A-type lamins, the intermediate filament proteins participating in nuclear structure and function, are encoded by LMNA. LMNA mutations can lead to laminopathies such as lipodystrophies, premature aging syndromes (progeria) and muscular dystrophies. Here, we identified a novel heterozygous LMNA p.R388P de novo mutation in a patient with a non-previously described severe phenotype comprising congenital muscular dystrophy (L-CMD) and lipodystrophy. In culture, the patient's skin fibroblasts entered prematurely into senescence, and some nuclei showed a lamina honeycomb pattern. C2C12 myoblasts were transfected with a construct carrying the patient's mutation; R388P-lamin A (LA) predominantly accumulated within the nucleoplasm and was depleted at the nuclear periphery, altering the anchorage of the inner nuclear membrane protein emerin and the nucleoplasmic protein LAP2-alpha. The mutant LA triggered a frequent and severe nuclear dysmorphy that occurred independently of prelamin A processing, as well as increased histone H3K9 acetylation. Nuclear dysmorphy was not significantly improved when transfected cells were treated with drugs disrupting microtubules or actin filaments or modifying the global histone acetylation pattern. Therefore, releasing any force exerted at the nuclear envelope by the cytoskeleton or chromatin did not rescue nuclear shape, in contrast to what was previously shown in Hutchinson-Gilford progeria due to other LMNA mutations. Our results point to the specific cytotoxic effect of the R388P-lamin A mutant, which is clinically related to a rare and severe multisystemic laminopathy phenotype.\n",
      "An emerging class of mitochondrial disorders is caused by mutations in nuclear genes affecting mitochondrial dynamics and function. One of these is the DNM1L gene encoding the dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1), which is pivotal in the mitochondrial fission process. Here, we describe a patient with a novel dominant-negative, de novo DNM1L mutation, which expands the clinical spectrum. The patient reported here exhibits a chronic neurological disorder, characterized by postnatal microcephaly, developmental delay, and pain insensitivity. Muscle biopsy disclosed decreased respiratory chain complex IV activity. Exome sequencing showed a de novo heterozygous c.1084G>A (p.G362S) mutation. Subsequent studies of patient skin fibroblasts showed markedly impaired mitochondrial fission and a partial respiratory chain defect while peroxisomal morphology remained intact. Human foreskin fibroblasts over-expressing the mutant DNM1L gene displayed aberrant mitochondrial morphology. √Ç¬© 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\n",
      "Two unrelated children with developmental delay, anterior chamber-cleavage disorder, proportionate short stature and striking similarity in facial appearance appear to have an identical syndrome. Peters' plus syndrome has to be considered but additional abnormalities not described in this syndrome and their apparently different facies may be evidence for a hitherto undescribed condition. The further malformations both children have in common are cerebellar hypoplasia, hypothyroidism, tracheostenosis and dislocated hips.\n",
      "Profound cellular immunodeficiency occurs as the result of mutations in proteins involved in both the differentiation and function of mature lymphoid cells. We describe here a novel human immune aberration arising from a truncation mutation of the interleukin-2 receptor alpha chain (CD25), a subunit of the tripartite high-affinity receptor for interleukin 2. This immunodeficiency is characterized by decreased numbers of peripheral T cells displaying abnormal proliferation but normal B cell development. Extensive lymphocytic infiltration of tissues, including lung, liver, gut, and bone, is observed, accompanied by tissue atrophy and inflammation. Although mature T cells are present, the absence of CD25 does affect the differentiation of thymocytes. While displaying normal development of CD2, CD3, CD4, and CD8 expression, CD25-deficient cortical thymocytes do not express CD1, and furthermore they fail to normally down-regulate levels of the anti-apoptotic protein bcl-2.\n",

      "Pontine Tegmental Cap Dysplasia (PTCD) is a recently described, rare disorder characterized by a peculiar cerebellar and brainstem malformation. Nineteen patients have been reported to date, of which only one in the adolescent age, and data on the clinical, cognitive and behavioural outcome of this syndrome are scarce. Here we describe three adolescent patients with PTCD. All presented bilateral deafness and multiple cranial neuropathies, variably associated with skeletal, cardiac and gastro-intestinal malformations. Feeding and swallowing difficulties, that are often causative of recurrent aspiration pneumonias and death in the first years of life, completely resolved with age in all three patients. Neuropsychological assessment showed borderline to moderate cognitive impairment, with delay in adaptive functioning, visual-spatial and language deficits. Two of three patients also showed mild behavioural problems, although their overall socialization abilities were well preserved. Cochlear implantation in two patients significantly improved their relational and learning abilities. Fibre tractography confirmed the abnormal bundle of transversely oriented fibres forming the typical pontine \"tegmental cap\" and absence of decussation of the superior cerebellar peduncles, supporting the hypothesis that PTCD results from abnormal axonal guidance and/or migration.These data indicate that PTCD may have a favourable long-term outcome, with borderline cognitive deficit or even normal cognition and partially preserved speech.\n",
      "Although many genes have been identified for the autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxias (ARCAs), several patients are unlinked to the respective loci, suggesting further genetic heterogeneity. We combined homozygosity mapping and exome sequencing in a consanguineous Egyptian family with congenital ARCA, mental retardation and pyramidal signs. A homozygous 5-bp deletion in SPTBN2, the gene whose in-frame mutations cause autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia type 5, was shown to segregate with ataxia in the family. Our findings are compatible with the concept of truncating SPTBN2 mutations acting recessively, which is supported by disease expression in homozygous, but not heterozygous, knockout mice, ataxia in Beagle dogs with a homozygous frameshift mutation and, very recently, a homozygous SPTBN2 nonsense mutation underlying infantile ataxia and psychomotor delay in a human family. As there was no evidence for mutations in 23 additional consanguineous families, SPTBN2-related ARCA is probably rare.\n",
      "Woodhouse Sakati syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive neuroendocrine disorder characterized by the combination of alopecia, hypogonadism, diabetes mellitus, mental retardation, sensory neural deafness and extrapyramidal features. Movement disorders mainly consist of dystonia and chorea of the limbs with onset in adolescence. Facial muscles are usually spared, but dysarthria is common. Pyramidal features and peripheral abnormalities are inconsistent features. Most of the reported families are from the Middle Eastern countries although rarely Caucasian cases have been described. Here we present clinical details of two affected siblings from a new Middle East family and draw attention of movement disorder specialists to this entity. We summarize findings from pervious cases with particular focus on neurological and movement disorder features.\n",
      "We report on two sibs (of 4) with a syndrome of minor facial anomalies, proportionate IUGR, neonatal non-autoimmune diabetes mellitus (NDM), severe congenital hypothyroidism (CH), cholestasis, congenital glaucoma, and polycystic kidneys. Liver disease progressed to hepatic fibrosis. The renal disease was characterized by large kidneys and multiple small cysts with deficient corticomedullary junction differentiation and normal kidney function. The phenotype observed in the two sibs was identical. Although a combination of liver, kidney, and pancreatic involvement has been described in Ivemark syndrome (hepato-renal-pancreatic syndrome), the coexistence of NDM, CH, and glaucoma in both sibs suggests the possibility that this combination of manifestations describes a new autosomal recessive syndrome. Mutation analysis for several candidate genes is warranted.\n",
      "Combined oxidative phosphorylation deficiency type 7 (COXPD7) is a rare disorder of mitochondrial metabolism that results in optic atrophy and Leigh syndrome-like disease. We describe 2 siblings with compound heterozygous mutations in the recently identified C12orf65 gene who presented with optic atrophy and mild developmental delays and subsequently developed bilateral, symmetric lesions in the brainstem reminiscent of Leigh syndrome. Repeat neuroimaging demonstrated reversibility of the findings in 1 sibling and persistent metabolic stroke in the other. This article highlights the phenotypic manifestations from a novel mutation in the C12orf65 gene and reviews the clinical presentation of the 5 other individuals reported to date who carry mutations in this gene.\n",
      "Pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare disorder of unknown cause characterized by peribronchial, perivascular, and perilymphatic proliferation of abnormal smooth muscle cells leading to cystic lesions. The hypothesis of hormonal dependence and the effectiveness of hormonal therapy have not yet been demonstrated conclusively, and the prevalence of extrathoracic manifestations and the survival of patients with LAM are somewhat contradictory. A multicentric retrospective study was conducted in an attempt to describe better the initial features, the diagnostic procedures, the associated lesions, and, above all, the management and course of LAM in a large homogeneous series of 69 stringently selected patients, with a majority of cases diagnosed since 1990. The aim of the study, based on a review of the literature, also was to provide a comprehensive view of this uncommon disease. The clinical features were in keeping with previous studies, but we found that exertional dyspnea and pneumothorax were the most common features, and chylous involvement was less frequent. LAM was diagnosed after menopause in about 10% of cases. The onset of LAM occurred during pregnancy in 20% of cases, and a clear exacerbation of LAM was observed in 14% of cases during pregnancy. Pulmonary LAM was diagnosed on lung histopathology in 83% of cases, but renal angiomyolipoma, observed in 32% of our patients, may be a useful diagnostic criterion when associated with typical multiple cysts on chest CT scan or with chylous effusion. Chest CT scan was more informative than chest X-ray (normal in 9% of cases), and may be indicated in spontaneous pneumothorax or renal angiomyolipoma in women of childbearing age. About 40% of the patients had a normal initial spirometry, while an obstructive ventilatory defect (44%), a restrictive ventilatory defect (23%), was observed in other patients. Initial diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide was frequently decreased (82%). Hormonal therapy was administered in 57 patients, but a clear > or = 15% improvement of FEV1 was observed in only 4 evaluable patients, treated with tamoxifen and progestogens (n = 2), progestogen (n = 1), and oophorectomy (n = 1). Probably 1 of the most urgent needs for clinical research in LAM is to test the currently available hormonal treatments in the context of international multicenter prospective controlled studies. Pleurodesis was performed in 40 patients. Lung transplantation was performed in 13 patients, 7.8 +/- 5.2 years after onset of LAM, in whom the mean FEV1 was 0.57 +/- 0.15 L. After a follow-up of 2.3 +/- 2.2 years, 9 patients were alive. Mean follow-up from onset of disease to either death or closing date was 8.2 +/- 6.3 years. Overall survival was better than usually reported in LAM, and Kaplan-Meier plot showed survival probabilities of 91% after 5 years, 79% after 10 years, and 71% after 15 years of disease duration.\n",
      "Chromatin remodeling through histone acetyltransferase (HAT) and histone deactylase (HDAC) enzymes affects fundamental cellular processes including the cell-cycle, cell differentiation, metabolism, and apoptosis. Nonsense mutations in genes that are involved in histone acetylation and deacetylation result in multiple congenital anomalies with most individuals displaying significant developmental delay, microcephaly and dysmorphism. Here, we report a syndrome caused by de novo heterozygous nonsense mutations in KAT6A (a.k.a., MOZ, MYST3) identified by clinical exome sequencing (CES) in four independent families. The same de novo nonsense mutation (c.3385C>T [p.Arg1129‚àó]) was observed in three individuals, and the fourth individual had a nearby de novo nonsense mutation (c.3070C>T [p.Arg1024‚àó]). Neither of these variants was present in 1,815 in-house exomes or in public databases. Common features among all four probands include primary microcephaly, global developmental delay including profound speech delay, and craniofacial dysmorphism, as well as more varied features such as feeding difficulties, cardiac defects, and ocular anomalies. We further demonstrate that KAT6A mutations result in dysregulation of H3K9 and H3K18 acetylation and altered P53 signaling. Through histone and non-histone acetylation, KAT6A affects multiple cellular processes and illustrates the complex role of acetylation in regulating development and disease.\n",
      "Hypothermia (defined as a core temperature lower than 35 degrees C) may result from accidental causes (exposure to cold, drug intoxications), from endocrine disorders (hypothyroidism), or from central or peripheral neurological disease. Among the causes of spontaneous hypothermia, the place of spontaneous periodic hypothermia or Shapiro's syndrome, of which less than 50 cases in children or adults have been reported, remains unclear.Case series of spontaneous hypothermia in adults, from a register of the French Society of Internal Medicine (SNFMI).The ten collected cases of spontaneous hypothermia are heterogeneous. In half of the cases, an often ill-labeled psychiatric illness and/or epilepsy and/or anti-psychotic medication were found contributive. Only 5 cases at best seem to conform to the pattern of spontaneous periodic hypothermia or Shapiro's syndrome (in which agenesis of corpus callosum is typically found). In such cases, the episodes of hypothermia start with profuse hyperhidrosis suggesting a paroxystic reset of the hypothalamic thermostat with a lower temperature set point. In none of the cases was found a significant encephalic lesion. None of the treatment trials with anti-epileptics or cyproheptadine were found useful. Spontaneous hypothermia, whether periodic or not, seems to have an unpredictable course, with long periods of remission, and a benign long-term outcome.Spontaneous hypothermia is a symptom of likely multifactorial etiology. Even in cases conforming to the definition of Shapiro's syndrome, central nervous system anomalies are not unequivocal. No specific treatment for spontaneous hypothermia, whether periodic or not, can be recommended in the current state of knowledge.\n",
      "PURPOSE: To present a boy with unilateral duplication of the eye. METHOD: The case history is described from the first visit at birth to the age of 14 years. RESULTS: A review of the literature shows that this malformation is compatible with life although malformations of the brain and epilepsy have been reported in all cases where a paediatric exam was described. We show that the malformation can appear as a synophthalmic eye in a single orbit or as two separate unilateral eyes in a separate orbit. CONCLUSION: We find the denomination, triophthalmia insufficient to differentiate between the two types and suggest a differentiation between unilateral synophthalmia and ipsilateral ocular duplication.\n",
      "Six cases are described of muscle weakness and wasting of scapuloperoneal distribution with an onset in early adult or middle life and a relatively benign progression. One case also showed mild facial weakness. Four cases were probably sporadic but in two, a mother and daughter, autosomal dominant inheritance was likely. Electromyographic studies demonstrated myopathic features in all, and this was confirmed by muscle biopsy in five. Electrocardiographic abnormalities were present in three cases, but their significance is uncertain. It is considered that adult onset scapuloperoneal myopathy constitutes a clinically distinct condition.\n",
      "Tufted angioma (TA) is a rare benign vascular neoplasm characterized histopathologically by the proliferation of endothelial cells arranged in lobules in the dermis and subcutaneous fat. To date, about 200 cases have been reported, most of which are of Japanese ethnicity. TA predominantly affects children and young adults, developing in 80% of patients younger than 10 years. A white 72-year-old renal transplant recipient presented with 2 asymptomatic dusky red papules on his right leg. The lesions appeared 5 years after the start of immunosuppressive treatment. Histopathologic examination showed a proliferation of poorly canalized capillary-sized vascular structures with typical \"cannonball\" pattern in the dermis and subcutaneous fat. Eccrine glands were also evident focally in the stroma of capillary lobules. On immunohistochemistry, endothelial cells in the vascular tufts stained positive for CD31 and CD34 but were negative for factor VIII-related antigen, human herpes virus 8, and podoplanin (clone D2-40); Œ±-smooth muscle actin stained pericytes disposed in a single layer in capillary-sized vessels and in 2-3 or more layers in vessels of larger size, respectively. The microscopic findings were suggestive of TA. In the deep dermis, venules with smooth muscle wall and arterioles, as shown by Van Gieson staining, normally not found at that level, were present and appeared surrounded by capillary lobules. Onset of TA in adulthood is rare and may be associated with pregnancy, varicella zoster virus infection, and pharmacological immunosuppression. A case of acquired adult-onset TA associated with an arteriovenous malformation in an elderly transplanted patient is described.\n",
      "Aromatase deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder with an unknown incidence. Aromatase converts androgens into estrogen in the gonadal and extra-gonadal tissues. Aromatase deficiency causes ambiguous genitalia in the female fetus and maternal virilization (hirsutism, acne, cliteromegaly, deep voice) during pregnancy due to increased concentration of androgens. A 19 months old girl patient was assessed due to presence of ambiguous genitalia. There were findings of maternal virilization during pregnancy. The karyotype was 46,XX. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia was not considered since adrenocorticotropic hormone, cortisol, and 17-hydroxyprogesterone levels were within normal ranges. At age two months, follicle-stimulating hormone and total testosterone levels were elevated and estradiol level was low. Based on these findings, aromatase deficiency was suspected. A novel homozygous mutation IVS7-2A>G (c.744-2A>G) was identified in the CYP19A1 gene. Pelvic ultrasound showed hypoplasic ovaries rather than large and cystic ovaries. We identified a novel mutation in the CYP19A1 gene in a patient who presented with ambiguous genitalia and maternal virilization during pregnancy. Presence of large and cystic ovaries is not essential in aromatase deficiency.\n",
      "We report studies of a Croatian boy, a proven case of human S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) hydrolase deficiency. Psychomotor development was slow until his fifth month; thereafter, virtually absent until treatment was started. He had marked hypotonia with elevated serum creatine kinase and transaminases, prolonged prothrombin time and low albumin. Electron microscopy of muscle showed numerous abnormal myelin figures; liver biopsy showed mild hepatitis with sparse rough endoplasmic reticulum. Brain MRI at 12.7 months revealed white matter atrophy and abnormally slow myelination. Hypermethioninemia was present in the initial metabolic study at age 8 months, and persisted (up to 784 microM) without tyrosine elevation. Plasma total homocysteine was very slightly elevated for an infant to 14.5-15.9 microM. In plasma, S-adenosylmethionine was 30-fold and AdoHcy 150-fold elevated. Activity of AdoHcy hydrolase was approximately equal to 3% of control in liver and was 5-10% of the control values in red blood cells and cultured fibroblasts. We found no evidence of a soluble inhibitor of the enzyme in extracts of the patient's cultured fibroblasts. Additional pretreatment abnormalities in plasma included low concentrations of phosphatidylcholine and choline, with elevations of guanidinoacetate, betaine, dimethylglycine, and cystathionine. Leukocyte DNA was hypermethylated. Gene analysis revealed two mutations in exon 4: a maternally derived stop codon, and a paternally derived missense mutation. We discuss reasons for biochemical abnormalities and pathophysiological aspects of AdoHcy hydrolase deficiency.\n",
      "We report a Brazilian female patient with a thin and long face, blepharophimosis, minor auricular anomalies, camptodactyly and thoracic and spinal anomalies. The constellation of clinical signs present in this patient is consistent with the diagnosis of Guadalajara camptodactyly syndrome type I. Clinical and genetic aspects concerning this condition are discussed.\n",
      "Bilateral vocal cord paralysis is a rare, but not unheard of, occurrence in the perinatal period. It is often incompatible with life unless the problem is recognized promptly, the child intubated, and--following this--a tracheotomy performed. Bilateral congenital ptosis is a very rare occurrence and is almost always associated with either significant central nervous system deficit or with other oculomotor problems. The combination of congenital bilateral recurrent nerve paralysis and congenital ptosis has not been previously reported in the English language literature. The author has had the opportunity to manage two patients, a father and his daughter, both of whom manifested this unusual combination of symptoms. Detailed case histories are presented. Both of the patients were successfully managed by temporary tracheotomy followed by reinnervation of the larynx, with eventual extubation and satisfactory day-to-day airway. Although only two cases represent an inadequate number to determine a new syndrome, these striking findings in a father and his only offspring suggest the possibility that this may, indeed, represent a new symptom complex of congenital origin.\n",
      "The purpose of this paper is to warn the ophthalmologist about the possibility of facing rare cases of corneal dystrophies. Clinical findings of a case of posterior amorphous dystrophy were correlated with refraction, topography, and ultrasound biomicroscopy.\n",
      "Familial isolated primary hyperparathyroidism (FIHP) is an autosomal dominant disorder that can represent an early stage of either the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) or hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor (HPT-JT) syndromes; alternatively, the condition can be caused by an allelic variant of MEN1 or HRPT2 (hyperparathyroidism 2 gene), or caused by a distinct entity involving another locus. We have explored these possibilities in a patient with primary hyperparathyroidism, whose mother had a history of renal calculi and primary hyperparathyroidism.Serum biochemistry and radiological investigations for primary hyperparathyroidism, MEN1 and HPT-JT, and genetic testing for MEN1 and HRPT2 mutations were undertaken.FIHP with primary hyperparathyroidism as the sole endocrinopathy due to a previously unreported heterozygous missense germline MEN1 mutation, Tyr351Asn. In addition, another unreported heterozygous missense germline MEN1 mutation, Trp220Leu, was identified in an unrelated male patient with FIHP, whose mother and sister also had primary hyperparathyroidism. DNA from a parathyroid tumor from the sister revealed a loss of heterozygosity in which the mutant allele was retained. This is consistent with Knudson's 'two-hit' model of hereditary cancer and a tumor suppressor role for MEN1 in FIHP.The patient underwent parathyroidectomy and has remained normocalcemic over a follow-up period of 6 years. The other four patients have remained normocalcemic for a follow-up period of 4-15 years following parathyroidectomy. None has developed abnormalities of the MEN1 syndrome, providing further support that FIHP is a distinct genetic variant of the MEN1 syndrome.\n",
      "Trichohepatoenteric syndrome or syndromic diarrhea is a rare and severe Mendelian autosomal recessive syndrome characterized by intractable diarrhea, facial and hair abnormalities, liver dysfunction, immunodeficiency and failure to thrive. It has been associated with mutations in TTC37 and SKIV2L genes, which encode proteins of the SKI complex that contributes to the cytosolic degradation of the messenger RNA by the cell's exosome. We report a case of a male infant who suffered from typical symptoms and signs of trichohepatoenteric syndrome without immunodeficiency. The patient's genetic testing showed a very rare mutation in SKIV2L gene's 25 exons (p.Glu1038 fs*7 (c.3112_3140del)). Even though our patient was provided with total parenteral nutrition from birth, the child's death in the third year of age highlights the severity of the disease and the poor prognosis of this particular type of genetic predisposition.\n",
      "We describe two newborn brothers with a pattern of malformation characterized by the persistence of M√ºllerian duct derivatives, intestinal lymphangiectasia, hypertrophied alveolar ridges, and early death. Postmortem examination showed the presence of a rudimentary uterus, fallopian tubes, the upper third of a vagina, a prostate of normal shape, a dilated colon, and generalized intestinal and pulmonary lymphangiectasia. The syndrome was first delineated by Urioste and co-workers [1993: Am J Med Genet 47:494-503]. These cases confirm the existence of a definite and distinct entity.\n",
      "INTRODUCTION: Juvenile hyaline fibromatosis and infantile systemic hyalinosis are variants of the same autosomal recessive syndrome; hyaline fibromatosis syndrome, characterized by papulonodular skin lesions, gingival hypertrophy, flexion contractures of joints, osteolytic bone lesions and stunted growth. Infantile systemic hyalinosis is distinguished from juvenile hyaline fibromatosis by its more severe phenotype, which includes hyaline deposits in multiple organs, recurrent infections and death within the first two years of life.Hyaline fibromatosis syndrome is due to mutations of the gene-encoding capillary morphogenesis protein 2 (CMG2). Cases have been reported in different countries but to the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported Moroccan patient with hyaline fibromatosis syndrome and carrying the CMG2 mutation. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of an eight-year-old Moroccan male patient with typical features of hyaline fibromatosis syndrome: multiple recurring subcutaneous tumors, gingival hypertrophy, joint contractures and other anomalies carrying a homozygous mutation in the CMG2 gene. The identification of the mutation in our patient allowed us to do a presymptomatic diagnosis in our patient's sister, a two-day-old newborn, who is carrying the familial mutation in the heterozygous state. Early recognition of this condition is important for genetic counseling and early treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Hyaline fibromatosis syndrome might be underdiagnosed. Molecular diagnosis will help clinicians and geneticists, firstly to conduct genetic counseling, prenatal diagnosis and early treatment, and secondly to gain better understanding of the disease and genotype-phenotype correlations.\n",
      "We report on a sibship with protein-losing enteropathy related to intestinal lymphangiectasia, a peculiar face, and genital anomalies. The parents are distantly related and from Dutch ancestry. The first patient was born with a protein-losing enteropathy, craniofacial anomalies, and renal defects. At 1 year of age, she died of severe complications of the protein-losing enteropathy and respiratory distress. Her brother was a cytogenetically normal male fetus identified by prenatal ultrasound at 19 weeks with similar anomalies. The pregnancy was terminated at 20 weeks. Autopsy showed m√ºllerian duct remnants. These cases seem to confirm the Urioste syndrome [Urioste et al., 1993: Am J Med Genet 47:494-503]. Although it was previously only reported in 46,XY individuals, this report of a consanguineous family with an affected sibship of both sexes suggests it to be an autosomal recessive entity.\n",
      "BACKGROUND AND METHODS: Mutations in the estrogen-receptor gene have been thought to be lethal. A 28-year-old man whose estrogen resistance was caused by a disruptive mutation in the estrogen-receptor gene underwent studies of pituitary-gonadal function and bone density and received transdermal estrogen for six months. Estrogen-receptor DNA, extracted from lymphocytes, was evaluated by analysis of single-strand-conformation polymorphisms and by direct sequencing. RESULTS: The patient was tall (204 cm [80.3 in.]) and had incomplete epiphyseal closure, with a history of continued linear growth into adulthood despite otherwise normal pubertal development. He was normally masculinized and had bilateral axillary acanthosis nigricans. Serum estradiol and estrone concentrations were elevated, and serum testosterone concentrations were normal. Serum follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone concentrations were increased. Glucose tolerance was impaired, and hyperinsulinemia was present. The bone mineral density of the lumbar spine was 0.745 g per square centimeter, 3.1 SD below the mean for age-matched normal women; there was biochemical evidence of increased bone turnover. The patient had no detectable response to estrogen administration, despite a 10-fold increase in the serum free estradiol concentration. Conformation analysis of his estrogen-receptor gene revealed a variant banding pattern in exon 2. Direct sequencing of exon 2 revealed a cytosine-to-thymine transition at codon 157 of both alleles, resulting in a premature stop codon. The patient's parents were heterozygous carriers of this mutation, and pedigree analysis revealed consanguinity. CONCLUSIONS: Disruption of the estrogen receptor in humans need not be lethal. Estrogen is important for bone maturation and mineralization in men as well as women.\n",
      "Recessive mutations in ALS2 (juvenile amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) are causative for early-onset upper motor neuron diseases, including infantile ascending hereditary spastic paralysis (IAHSP). The goal of this study is to identify novel disease-causing ALS2 mutations.Mutations in ALS2 were screened by direct sequencing of complementary DNA obtained from patients' lymphoblasts.We report a novel ALS2 missense mutation in patients affected by IAHSP. This homozygous G669A mutation in exon 4 is predicted to result in a tyrosine substitution at cysteine 156 of the RCC1 (regulator of chromatin condensation)-like domain, encoding a putative guanine exchange factor for Ran guanosine triphosphatase, leading to a loss of ALS2 function due to instability of mutant protein.These results highlight the important role of the RCC1-like domain in ALS2 stability and function that is essential for upper motor neuron maintenance.\n",
      "We report two sisters born to consanguineous parents with an identical syndrome consisting of severe mental retardation and epilepsy, hypoplastic terminal phalanges, and anteriorly displaced anus. Further metabolic and genetic testing failed to detect the etiology. A whole genome linkage scan showed homozygosity for a 28-Mb region on chromosome 1p, and a 65-Mb region spanning most of chromosome 14. These results are consistent with an autosomal recessive condition that is similar to, but likely distinct from, Coffin-Siris syndrome.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: The 17p13.3 deletion syndrome (or Miller-Dieker syndrome, MDS, MIM 247200) is characterized by lissencephaly, mental retardation and facial dysmorphism. The phenotype is attributed to haploinsufficiency of two genes present in the minimal critical region of MDS: PAFAH1B1 (formerly referred to as LIS1) and YWHAE. Whereas isolated PAFAH1B1 deletion causes lissencephaly, YWHAE is a candidate for the dysmorphic phenotype associated with MDS. OBJECTIVE: We describe clinical, neuroradiological and molecular data in four patients with a 17p13.3 deletion distal to PAFAH1B1 involving YWHAE. RESULTS: All patients presented with mild or moderate developmental delay and pre and/or post-natal growth retardation. Patients A, B and C had neuro-imaging anomalies: leucoencephalopathy with macrocephaly (patients A and C), Chiari type 1 malformation (patient A) and paraventricular cysts (patient C). Patient B had patent ductus arteriosus and pulmonary arterial hypertension. Patient C had unilateral club foot. Patient D had enlarged Virchow Robin spaces, microcornea, and chorioretinal and lens coloboma. Array-CGH revealed de novo terminal 17p13.3 deletions for patient A and B, and showed interstitial 17p13.3 deletions of 1.4 Mb for patient C and of 0.5 Mb for patient D. In all patients, PAFAH1B1 was not deleted. CONCLUSION: Our patients confirm that 17p deletion distal to PAFAH1B1 have a distinctive phenotype : mild mental retardation, moderate to severe growth restriction, white matter abnormalities and developmental defects including Chiari type 1 malformation and coloboma. Our patients contribute to the delineation and clinical characterization of 17p13.3 deletion distal to PAFAH1B1 and highlight the role of the region containing YWHAE in brain and eye development and in somatic growth.\n",
      "Frontonasal dysplasias are rare congenital malformations of frontonasal process-derived structures, characterized by median cleft, nasal anomalies, widely spaced eyes, and cranium bifidum occultum. Several entities of syndromic frontonasal dysplasia have been described, among which, to date, only a few have identified molecular bases. We clinically ascertained a cohort of 124 individuals referred for frontonasal dysplasia. We identified six individuals with a similar phenotype, including one discordant monozygous twin. Facial features were remarkable by nasal deformity with creased ridge and depressed or absent tip, widely spaced eyes, almond-shaped palpebral fissures, and downturned corners of the mouth. All had apparently normal psychomotor development. In addition, upper limb anomalies, frontonasal encephalocele, corpus callosum agenesis, choanal atresia, and congenital heart defect were observed. We identified five reports in the literature of patients presenting with the same phenotype. Exome sequencing was performed on DNA extracted from blood of two individuals, no candidate gene was identified. In conclusion, we report six novel simplex individuals presenting with a specific frontonasal dysplasia entity associating recognizable facial features, limb and visceral malformations, and apparently normal development. The identification of discordant monozygotic twins supports the hypothesis of a mosaic disorder. Although previous patients have been reported, this is the first series, allowing delineation of a clinical subtype of frontonasal dysplasia, paving the way toward the identification of its molecular etiology.\n",
      "BACKGROUND:Duplication of the pituitary gland (DPG) is a rare craniofacial developmental anomaly occurring during blastogenesis with postulated etiology such as incomplete twinning, teratogens, median cleft face syndrome or splitting of the notochord. The complex craniocaudal spectrum of blastogenesis defects associated with DPG is examined with an illustrative case. CASE DESCRIPTION:We report for the first time in the medical literature some unique associations with DPG, such as a clival encephalocele, third cerebral peduncle, duplicate odontoid process and a double tongue with independent volitional control. This patient also has the previously reported common associations such as duplicated sella, cleft palate, hypertelorism, callosal agenesis, hypothalamic enlargement, nasopharyngeal teratoma, fenestrated basilar artery and supernumerary teeth. This study also reviews 37 cases of DPG identified through MEDLINE literature search from 1880 to 2011. It provides a detailed analysis of the current case through physical examination and imaging. CONCLUSION:The authors propose that the developmental deformities associated with duplication of pituitary gland (DPG) occur as part of a developmental continuum, not as chance associations. Considering the fact that DPG is uniquely and certainly present throughout the spectrum of these blastogenesis defects, we suggest the term DPG-plus syndrome.\n",
      "Gorlin-Chaudhry-Moss syndrome (OMIM 233500) is a rare congenital malformation syndrome with the cardinal manifestations of craniofacial dysostosis, hypertrichosis, underdeveloped genitalia, ocular, and dental anomalies. Since 1960, only six affected individuals have been reported. We report a 4-year and 6-month-old female patient with this phenotype and review the clinical presentation of all patients known so far. Previously unreported malformations of the extremities, larynx, and nose are also described, expanding the phenotype of this rare syndrome. Array-CGH analysis did not show pathological deletions or duplications.\n",
      "Four sibs of non-consanguineous parents who had myotonia from late infancy are described. Mild to moderate mental retardation, severe bone abnormalities of the vertebral column (mainly in the thoracolumbar region), and short stature were also observed. Autosomal recessive inheritance is demonstrated. These cases are compared with reported cases of the Schwartz-Jampel syndrome.\n",
      "We present a male child at 3 years old with Anophthalmia-Plus Syndrome (APS). He has asymmetry of the face and head, left choanal atresia, a sunken facial appearance, microphthalmia in the right eye, severe microphthalmia in the left eye, bilateral low-set ears, scarring from cleft palate surgery. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sections revealed decreased right globe volume, an undeveloped left globe, decreased left optical nerve thickness, Chiari type 2 malformation, left choanal atresia and cleft palate. Echocardiography and abdominal ultrasonography were normal. The patient has a 45 dB conductive hearing loss in the left ear. Repeated thyroid function tests were evaluated as compatible with central hypothyroidism. We report a Fryns Anophthalmia-Plus Syndrome in a child with unusual findings including central hypothyroidism, chiari type 2 malformation, conductive hearing loss and developmental regression. Summary of the features reported in the present case and all 14 previous cases that might be defined as APS.\n",
      "We describe four children from two consanguineous families with distinctive hand and foot anomalies including preaxial brachydactyly, together with phalangeal duplication, symphalangism and hyperphalangism of fingers I-III. These anomalies are remarkably similar to those described in a previous case report. Additional features were noted both in this case and, to variable degrees, in the four children reported here. These included sensorineural deafness, optic atrophy, mild facial dysmorphism, orodental anomalies and developmental delay. Autosomal recessive inheritance was previously suggested as the patient had a similarly affected brother and his parents were consanguineous. These four cases provide additional evidence for a novel, autosomal recessive disorder involving limb and other associated anomalies.\n",
      "Glutamine deficiency with hyperammonemia due to an inherited defect of glutamine synthetase (GS) was found in a 2 year old patient. He presented neonatal seizures and developed chronic encephalopathy. Thus, GS deficiency leads to severe neurological disease but is not always early lethal.\n",
      "A decade after the designation of MED13L as a gene and its link to intellectual disability (ID) and dextro-looped transposition of great arteries in 2003, we previously described a recognizable syndrome due to MED13L haploinsufficiency. Subsequent reports of 22 further patients diagnosed by genome-wide testing further delineated the syndrome with expansion of the phenotypic spectrum and showed reduced penetrance for congenital heart defects. We now report two novel patients identified by whole exome sequencing, one with a de novo MED13L truncating mutation and the other with a de novo missense mutation. The first patient indicates some facial resemblance to Kleefstra syndrome as a novel differential diagnosis, and the second patient shows, for the first time, recurrence of a MED13L missense mutation (p.(Asp860Gly)). Notably, our in silico modelling predicted this missense mutation to decrease the stability of an alpha-helix and thereby affecting the MED13L secondary structure, while the majority of published missense mutations remain variants of uncertain significance. Review of the reported patients with MED13L haploinsufficiency indicates moderate to severe ID and facial anomalies in all patients, as well as severe speech delay and muscular hypotonia in the majority. Further common signs include abnormal MRI findings of myelination defects and abnormal corpus callosum, ataxia and coordination problems, autistic features, seizures/abnormal EEG, or congenital heart defects, present in about 20-50% of the patients. With reference to facial anomalies, the majority of patients were reported to show broad/prominent forehead, low set ears, bitemporal narrowing, upslanting palpebral fissures, depressed/flat nasal bridge, bulbous nose, and abnormal chin, but macroglossia and horizontal eyebrows were also observed in √¢ÀÜ¬º30%. The latter are especially important in the differential diagnosis of 1p36 deletion and Kleefstra syndromes, while the more common facial gestalt shows some resemblance to 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. Despite the fact that MED13L was found to be one of the most common ID genes in the Deciphering Developmental Disorders Study, further detailed patient descriptions are needed to explore the full clinical spectrum, potential genotype-phenotype correlations, as well as the role of missense mutations and potential mutational hotspots along the gene.\n",
      "We report two brothers with a previously undescribed type of mitochondrial encephalomyopathy and associated aminoacidopathy. Both have growth failure, progressive intellectual decline, deafness, neurologic dysfunction, exercise intolerance, lactic acidosis, and abnormal plasma and cerebrospinal fluid amino acid levels (elevated levels of alanine and low levels of threonine, methionine, citrulline, tryptophan, ornithine, arginine, and lysine). A muscle biopsy specimen taken from the younger, more severely affected brother showed abnormal mitochondrial morphology. Activities of the following enzymes in cultured fibroblasts from both boys were normal: pyruvate dehydrogenase, pyruvate carboxylase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, cytochrome oxidase, reduced nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide-cytochrome c reductase, and succinate cytochrome c reductase. Fibroblast mitochondria from the younger boy showed undetectable (less than 1% of control values) adenosine triphosphate synthesis with pyruvate and malate, whereas adenosine triphosphate synthesis with succinate was 70% of control values. These data indicate probably deficient activity of complex I of the electron transport chain. The boys' mother has progressive neurosensory hearing loss; their sister is clinically normal. Both mother and sister have many of the biochemical abnormalities found in the boys. It is possible, but not proved, that this disorder is inherited through maternal mitochondria.\n",
      "Xp21 continuous gene deletion syndrome is characterized by complex glycerol kinase deficiency (GK), adrenal hypoplasia congenital (NROB1), intellectual disability and/or Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The clinical features depend on the size of the deletion, as well as on the number and the nature of the encompassed genes. More than 100 male patients have been reported so far, while only a few cases of symptomatic female carriers have been described. We report here detailed clinical features and X chromosome inactivation analysis in two unrelated female patients with overlapping Xp21 deletions presenting with intellectual disability and inconstant muscular symptoms.\n",
      "The iron-sulfur-containing DNA helicases XPD, FANCJ, DDX11, and RTEL represent a small subclass of superfamily 2 helicases. XPD and FANCJ have been connected to the genetic instability syndromes xeroderma pigmentosum and Fanconi anemia. Here, we report a human individual with biallelic mutations in DDX11. Defective DDX11 is associated with a unique cellular phenotype in which features of Fanconi anemia (drug-induced chromosomal breakage) and Roberts syndrome (sister chromatid cohesion defects) coexist. The DDX11-deficient patient represents another cohesinopathy, besides Cornelia de Lange syndrome and Roberts syndrome, and shows that DDX11 functions at the interface between DNA repair and sister chromatid cohesion.\n",
      "Dentin dysplasia type I is a rare hereditary disturbance of dentin formation characterized clinically by nearly normal appearing crowns and severe hypermobility of teeth. Radiographic analysis shows obliteration of all pulp chambers, short, blunted, and malformed roots, and periapical radiolucencies of noncarious teeth. This paper presents 2 cases demonstrating both classic and atypical features of type I dentin dysplasia in the mixed and permanent dentitions. The clinical, radiographic, and histopathologic\\findings of this condition and treatment are described.\n",
      "A 30-year-old nulliparous woman was seen for a detailed ultrasound scan at 20 weeks of gestation. The scan revealed a male fetus with truncus arteriosus, membranous ventricular septal defect, absent thymus and sacral meningomyelocele. A 46,XY karyotype with a 22q11 deletion was detected. The parents chose to terminate the pregnancy. The pathological autopsy showed normal facial structures, minimal ventricular dilatation in the brain and a sacral meningomyelocele. Overlapping toes and a left claw-hand were also noted. An aplastic thymus with absent parathyroid glands was detected. The cardiac examination was consistent with the ultrasound diagnosis. The parental karyotypes were both normal. Kousseff syndrome is caused by a chromosome 22q11 deletion. It includes sacral meningomyelocele and conotruncal heart defects, unlike DiGeorge syndrome. Obstetricians should consider this a not so rare entity when they detect conotruncal abnormalities and a meningomyelocele as part of a 22q11.2 deletion syndrome.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: The authors report a three-generation family with four male patients presenting with a novel type of X-chromosomal leukoencephalopathy associated with skeletal abnormalities. METHODS: The index patient and his brother reached their early motor milestones in due time and had normal language development. Between the ages of 2 and 3 years, first signs of spastic paraplegia were noticed. Furthermore, the patients developed tremor, ataxia, optic atrophy, and spastic tetraparesis. Both boys had broad wrists and knees without significant contractures. A maternal uncle and a granduncle had the same disease. RESULTS: Leukoencephalopathy (MRI, MRS) and metaphyseal chondrodysplasia (X-ray, MRI) were diagnosed. MRS showed a reduction of choline-containing compounds in the white matter. An autopsy on one of the patients, who died at age 37 years, revealed an orthochromatic type of leukoencephalopathy. In bone and cartilage tissue, unspecific signs of a mild chondrodysplasia were found. At the PLP gene locus an obligate recombination was observed, which excludes the Pelizaeus-Merzbacher locus on Xq21-22. However, affected males share a fragment of the long arm of chromosome X. CONCLUSION: The authors report a new type of leukoencephalopathy associated with metaphyseal chondrodysplasia located on Xq25-q27.\n",
      "We report on a case of Raine syndrome with a mutation in FAM20C and typical phenotypic features consisting of midface hypoplasia, hypoplastic nose, choanal atresia, wide fontanelle, exophthalmos, generalized osteosclerosis and intracranial calcification. New features in our patient are cerebellar hypoplasia and pachygyria. We review the literature and conclude that the triad of hypoplastic nose, exophthalmos and generalized osteosclerosis and/or intracranial calcification is consistent in all molecularly confirmed cases.\n",
      "VPS45-associated severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) is a rare disorder characterized by life-threating infections, neutropenia, neutrophil and platelet dysfunction, poor response to filgrastim, and myelofibrosis with extramedullary hematopoiesis. We present a patient with SCN due to a homozygous c.1403C>T (p.P468L) mutation in VPS45, critical regulator of SNARE-dependent membrane fusion. Structural modeling indicates that P468, like the T224 and E238 residues affected by previously reported mutations, cluster in a VPS45 \"hinge\" region, indicating its critical role in membrane fusion and VPS45-associated SCN. Bone marrow transplantation, complicated by early graft failure rescued with stem cell boost, led to resolution of the hematopoietic phenotype.\n",
      "We report on a 17 6/12-year-old boy with nephronophthisis, retinitis pigmentosa, left upper eyelid ptosis, enopthalmos, transmissive deafness, GH and TSH deficiency, and mild skeletal dysplasia. A similar case was reported by Bianchi et al. [1988: Helv Paediatr Acta 43:449-455] in another Italian patient. Here we confirm the previous observations and argue that both patients might be affected by a new syndrome.\n",
      "Congenital hereditary bilateral abductor vocal cord paralysis has been found in a father, his son and daughter. Though the disorder was previously believed to be inherited in a sex-linked manner, it now appears that there is an autosomal dominant variant. The vocal cord paralysis was associated with swallowing difficulty during infancy in all three of the family members. Although both the son and daughter required tracheostomies during the neonatal period, both manifested improvement of vocal cord movement during infancy so that decannulation was possible before 14 months of age. Localized delay in neurologic maturation is suspected as the etiology.\n",
      "Pierson syndrome (PS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder, caused by mutations in the laminin Œ≤2 (LAMB2) gene. It is characterized by congenital nephrotic syndrome, microcoria, and neurodevelopmental deficits. Several mutations with genotype-phenotype correlations have been reported, often with great clinical variability. We hereby report a novel homozygous nonsense mutation in the LAMB2 gene, associated with a severe phenotype presentation.We describe a term male infant born from consanguineous parents. The mother previously lost three children in the neonatal period, secondary to undefined renal disease, had two spontaneous abortions, and gave birth to one healthy daughter. The index case presented at birth with bilateral microcoria, severe hypotonia, respiratory distress, and congenital nephrotic syndrome associated with anuria and severe renal failure requiring peritoneal dialysis. The patients' clinical follow-up was unfavorable, and the newborn died at 7¬†days of life, after withdrawal of life support. Genetic analysis revealed a homozygous nonsense mutation at position c.2890C>T causing a premature stop codon (p.R964*) in LAMB2 gene.We here describe a novel nonsense homozygous mutation in LAMB2 gene causing a severe neonatal presentation of Pierson syndrome. This new mutation expands the genotype-phenotype spectrum of this rare disease and confirms that truncating mutations might be associated with severe clinical features.\n",
      "Nablus mask-like facial syndrome (NMLFS) has many distinctive phenotypic features, particularly tight glistening skin with reduced facial expression, blepharophimosis, telecanthus, bulky nasal tip, abnormal external ear architecture, upswept frontal hairline, and sparse eyebrows. Over the last few years, several individuals with NMLFS have been reported to have a microdeletion of 8q21.3q22.1, demonstrated by microarray analysis. The minimal overlapping region is 93.98-96.22√¢‚Ç¨‚Ä∞Mb (hg19). Here we present clinical and microarray data from five singletons and two mother-child pairs who have heterozygous deletions significantly overlapping the region associated with NMLFS. Notably, while one mother and child were said to have mild tightening of facial skin, none of these individuals exhibited reduced facial expression or the classical facial phenotype of NMLFS. These findings indicate that deletion of the 8q21.3q22.1 region is necessary but not sufficient for development of the NMLFS. We discuss possible genetic mechanisms underlying the complex pattern of inheritance for this condition.\n",
      "The skeletal dysplasia characteristic of acrodysostosis resembles the Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy seen in patients with pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1a, but defects in the Œ±-stimulatory subunit of the G-protein (GNAS), the cause of pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1a, are not present in patients with acrodysostosis. We report a germ-line mutation in the gene encoding PRKAR1A, the cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent regulatory subunit of protein kinase A, in three unrelated patients with acrodysostosis and resistance to multiple hormones. The mutated subunit impairs the protein kinase A response to stimulation by cAMP; this explains our patients' hormone resistance and the similarities of their skeletal abnormalities with those observed in patients with pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1a.\n",
      "Hypoxia-inducible factors are transcription factors controlling energy, iron metabolism, erythropoiesis, and development. When these proteins are dysregulated, they contribute to tumorigenesis and cancer progression. However, mutations in genes encoding Œ± subunits of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF-Œ±) have not previously been identified in any cancer. Here we report two novel somatic gain-of-function mutations in the gene encoding hypoxia-inducible factor 2Œ± (HIF2A) in two patients, one presenting with paraganglioma and the other with paraganglioma and somatostatinoma, both of whom had polycythemia. The two mutations were associated with increased HIF-2Œ± activity and increased protein half-life.\n",
      "We report on a father and his 4-year-old son sharing a characteristic dysmorphic facial phenotype (including hyperteleroism, prominent forehead, and wide nasal bridge), macrocephaly, hearing loss, palatal clefting, developmental delay, hypotonia and bony abnormalities including marked cranial sclerosis and sclerosis of the ribs and long bones, which evolved in severity in the son between the ages of 2 and 4 years. The father's radiographs also showed prominent coarse striations, patchy metaphyseal sclerotic plaques, markedly increased bone density and cortical thickening of long bones, and significant degenerative changes in the thoracic spine. The son has an additional history of sleep apnea resulting from multi-level airway obstruction that includes adenoid hypertrophy, lingual tonsil hypertrophy, subglottic stenosis, and supra-arytenoid tissue consistent with laryngomalacia and tracheomalacia. The clinical, radiographic, and genetic findings in father and son are consistent with a sclerosing skeletal dysplasia syndrome with similarities to mixed sclerosing bone dysplasia (MSBD) including metaphyseal plaques, osteopathia striata, and cranial sclerosis (OS-CS). This family may represent one of the first descriptions of familial inheritance and evolving phenotype in MSBD. The evidence for male-male transmission would support the existence of an autosomal mechanism of inheritance for a novel form of MSBD with characteristic syndromic features.\n",
      "We report on a fetus with cranio-facial anomalies, a narrow thorax, imperforate anus with cloacal cyst, and a genitourinary malformation with absent uterus, vagina, and external genitalia. Major thoracic defects were seen on roentgenographic examination, including absent vertebrae and ribs, a supernumerary vertebra, a hemivertebra, and rib fusion. These findings are compatible with Casamassima-Morton-Nance syndrome. The patient was the carrier of a translocation t(6;9)(p12;q12), inherited from the mother. Although the occurrence of this rearrangement may be coincidental, it may also indicate a possible locus for this autosomal recessive thoracic dysplasia.\n",
      "We report a female patient with severe mental retardation and multiple congenital anomalies. These consist of unusual facies (grooved, nasal tip, ptosis, malformed auricles), abnormal digits, and congenital heart and renal defects. These findings strongly resemble the NFDR syndrome, first described by Freire-Maia et al.\n",
      "A case of congenital pancreatic cysts detected antenatally by ultrasound is presented. This is the second case detected antenatally. Congenital pancreatic cysts should be included in the differential diagnosis of upper abdominal cystic masses in the fetus and newborn infant.\n",
      "We report a 19 year-old patient carrying a terminal 20p microdeletion. She displayed clinical features resembling those of two other previously described patients. We suggest that a specific phenotype can be associated with this chromosomal anomaly. Mental retardation, epilepsy, and dysmorphic signs including low-set ears and overfolded helices seem highly characteristic of this syndrome and may define major diagnostic criteria of a recognizable phenotype. Delayed closure of fontanella, delayed permanent teeth eruption, visual disturbances, prominent ear lobes, prominent nasal root and ridge, thin upper lip and brachydactyly may represent inconstant minor criteria.\n",
      "We report a consanguineous Lebanese family where six individuals had disproportionate short stature, short limbs, and bilateral genu varum that were apparent after 2 years of age. Major radiographic features in infancy included flared, cupped, and ragged metaphyses of all long bones, delayed maturation of the scaphoid, trapezoid, and trapezium bones, wide and slightly irregular ribs, short femoral necks, flat femoral heads, and irregularity of the iliac crest. Radiographs of an affected adult showed diminished metaphyseal changes and slightly short femoral necks, when compared to the younger patients. We suggest that this family is affected with the Spahr type of metaphyseal chondrodysplasia. Sequencing of RMRP, and a haplotype analysis using highly informative markers around the COL10A1 excluded both genes from being pathogenic in this family. We are aware of only two previous reports of families with clinical features similar to the Spahr type of metaphyseal chondrodysplasia.\n",
      "A Bedouin family is described with an unusual form of spinocerebellar degeneration. Spastic ataxia was found to be associated with congenital cataracts, macular corneal dystrophy and non-axial myopia, in the absence of retardation of somatic or mental maturation. Immunological abnormalities were common. Genetic analysis revealed that the pedigree is expressing the transmission and segregation of a single mutant autosomal recessive gene.\n",
      "Klippel-Feil anomaly (KFA) can be seen in a number of syndromes. We describe an apparently novel syndromic association with KFA.Clinical phenotyping of two consanguineous families followed by combined autozygome/exome analysis.Two patients from two apparently unrelated families shared a strikingly similar phenotype characterised by KFA, myopathy, mild short stature, microcephaly, and distinctive facies. They shared a single founder autozygous interval in which whole exome sequencing revealed a truncating mutation in MYO18B. There was virtually complete loss of the transcript in peripheral blood, indicative of nonsense-mediated decay. Electron microscopy of muscle confirms abnormal myosin filaments with accompanying myopathic changes.Deficiency of MYO18B is linked to a novel developmental disorder which combines KFA with myopathy. This suggests a widespread developmental role for this gene in humans, as observed for its murine ortholog.\n",
      "An MYH2 mutation p.(Glu706Lys) was originally described in a family with autosomal dominant inheritance, where the affected family members presented with multiple congenital contractures and ophthalmoplegia, progressing to a proximal myopathy in adulthood. Another patient with a dominant mutation p.(Leu1870Pro) was described, presenting as a congenital myopathy with ophthalmoplegia. Here, we present a patient with symptoms beginning at age 16 years, of prominent distal but also proximal weakness, bulbar involvement and ophthalmoplegia. Initially, clinically classified as oculopharyngodistal myopathy, the patient was found to carry a novel, de novo MYH2 mutation c.5630T>C p.(Leu1877Pro). This expands the phenotype of dominant MYH2 myopathies with the clinical phenotype overlapping the oculopharyngodistal myopathy spectrum.\n",
      "Macrosomia, obesity, macrocephaly, and ocular abnormalities syndrome (MOMO syndrome) has been reported in only four patients to date. In these sporadic cases, no chromosomal or molecular abnormality has been identified thus far. Here, we report on the clinical, cytogenetic, and molecular findings in a child of healthy consanguineous parents suffering from MOMO syndrome. Conventional karyotyping revealed an inherited homozygous balanced reciprocal translocation (16;20)(q21;p11.2). Uniparental disomy testing showed bi-parental inheritance for both derivative chromosomes 16 and 20. The patient's oligonucleotide array-comparative genomic hybridization profile revealed no abnormality. From the homozygous balanced reciprocal translocation (16;20)(q21;p11.2), a positional cloning strategy, designed to narrow 16q21 and 20p11.2 breakpoints, revealed the disruption of a novel gene located at 20p11.23. This gene is now named LINC00237, according to the HUGO (Human Genome Organization) nomenclature. The gene apparently leads to the production of a non-coding RNA. We established that LINC00237 was expressed in lymphocytes of control individuals while normal transcripts were absent in lymphocytes of our MOMO patient. LINC00237 was not ubiquitously expressed in control tissues, but it was notably highly expressed in the brain. Our results suggested autosomal recessive inheritance of MOMO syndrome. LINC00237 could play a role in the pathogenesis of this syndrome and could provide new insights into hyperphagia-related obesity and intellectual disability.\n",
      "Acrocephalopolydactylous dysplasia, (Elejalde syndrome) is a rare condition; only six cases have been reported to date. We describe two infants born with Elejalde syndrome (ES); compare the clinical, pathological, and histological findings with those of known cases of Elejalde syndrome. The post-mortem histology study of the skin shows hyperplasia of connective tissues, a diagnostic sign in this condition. We describe cardiomegaly, cleft palate, and cryptorchidism not reported previously.\n",
      "The association of palmoplantar keratoderma (PPK) with the development of cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), dental anomalies, severe hypogenitalism with hypospadias, abnormal development of gonads with ambiguous external genitalia, gynecomastia, altered plasma sex hormones levels, and hypertriglyceridemia has not, to our knowledge, been reported previously. We describe it in 4 brothers with 46,XX karyotype, whereas the 5 sisters of their consanguineous parents were unaffected. This family may represent a new syndrome. The PPK was of the classical nonepidermolytic histologic type. The proband also had a laryngeal carcinoma diagnosed in his early forties and nodular testicular hyperplasia of Leydig cells.\n",
      "Two three-year-old boys with dwarfism (height ages 1-4/2 and 1-11/12 years) and delayed bone ages (1-4/12 and 1-9/12 years) had normal growth hormone (GH) responses after stimulation and low levels of somatomedin. Unlike patients with Laron syndrome, the two patients generated normal levels of somatomedin after administration of exogenous hGH. Treatment with hGH (2 IU every other day) brought about a significant increase in the growth rate of both patients. The growth rate of the first patient increased from 2 cm/year before treatment to 12 cm/year on therapy. The growth rate of the second patient was 4.5 cm/year before treatment, and 8.3 cm/year while on treatment. The two cases represent a new syndrome of dwarfism which may be caused by secretion of a biologically inactive but immunoreactive GH.\n",
      "We report on three young children, two girls and one boy, with pre- and postnatal growth deficiency, hypotonia, psychomotor retardation with notably impaired speech development, hypotrophy of the distal extremities, small hands and feet, small and widely spaced teeth, eczematous skin, and, in two of them, a partial agenesis of the corpus callosum. To our knowledge this specific combination of features has not been reported before. Since the two girls are sisters and the boy is the product of a consanguineous marriage, the inheritance of this new syndrome appears to be autosomal recessive.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE:To clarify the phenotype in a bone dysplasia termed \"spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia with accumulation of glycoprotein in the chondrocytes\" by Stanescu et al. DESIGN AND PATIENTS:Subjects comprised two definitive cases of one family and one probable case of another family. Histologic examination in one patient warranted the diagnosis of the first family, whereas the diagnosis of the second family was based solely on clinical and radiologic grounds. RESULTS:Pedigrees revealed an autosomal dominant mode of transmission. All three patients shared painful large joints with joint restriction, progressive contracture with osseous expansion of the finger joints, and normal height despite the presence of a short trunk. Moderate platyspondyly, hypoplastic ilia, epiphyseal flattening with metaphyseal splaying of the tubular bones, and most characteristically, broad, elongated femoral necks with striking coxa valga were identical in all patients, but the patient of the second family showed severe brachydactyly unlike the other two patients. Histologic examination revealed PAS-positive, amylase-resistant intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies in the chondrocytes, corresponding to dilated rough endoplasmic reticulum filled with moderately electron-dense materials found by electron microscopy. CONCLUSION:The manifestations of our patients are sufficiently characteristic to constitute a distinct entity.\n",
      "We report three unrelated fetuses presenting with anencephaly, spinal dysraphism, cleft lip and palate and limb reduction defects. Review of the literature suggests that this association may be more commonly found than previously recognized and may indicate severe disturbance in early embryogenesis.\n",
      "CONTEXT:Adhesion molecule deficiency type 1 is a rare disease that should be suspected in any patient whose umbilical cord presents delay in falling off, and who presents recurrent severe infections. Early diagnostic suspicion and early treatment improve the prognosis. CASE REPORT:The case of a four-month-old boy with recurrent hospitalizations because of severe bronchopneumonia and several episodes of acute otitis media with non-purulent drainage of mucus and positive bacterial cultures is presented. His medical history included neonatal sepsis and delayed umbilical cord detachment. Laboratory studies showed marked leukocytosis with predominance of neutrophils and decreased CD11b and CD18. These were all compatible with a diagnosis of leukocyte adhesion deficiency type I [LAD type 1].\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Ring chromosome 6 is a rare constitutional abnormality that generally occurs de novo. The related phenotype may be highly variable ranging from an almost normal phenotype to severe malformations and mental retardation. These features are mainly present when genetic material at the end of the chromosome is lost. The severity of the phenotype seems to be related to the size of the deletion. About 25 cases have been described to date, but the vast majority reports only conventional cytogenetic investigations. CASE PRESENTATION: Here we present an accurate cyto-molecular characterization of a ring chromosome 6 in a 16-months-old Caucasian girl with mild motor developmental delay, cardiac defect, and facial anomalies. The cytogenetic investigations showed a karyotype 46,XX,r(6)(p25q27) and FISH analysis revealed the absence of the signals on both arms of the chromosome 6. These results were confirmed by means of array-CGH showing terminal deletions on 6p25.3 (1.3 Mb) and 6q26.27 (6.7 Mb). Our data were compared to current literature. CONCLUSIONS: Our report describes the case of a patient with a ring chromosome 6 abnormality completely characterized by array CGH which provided additional information for genotype-phenotype studies.\n",
      "Thioredoxin 2 (TXN2; also known as Trx2) is a small mitochondrial redox protein essential for the control of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species homeostasis, apoptosis regulation and cell viability. Exome sequencing in a 16-year-old adolescent suffering from an infantile-onset neurodegenerative disorder with severe cerebellar atrophy, epilepsy, dystonia, optic atrophy, and peripheral neuropathy, uncovered a homozygous stop mutation in TXN2. Analysis of patient-derived fibroblasts demonstrated absence of TXN2 protein, increased reactive oxygen species levels, impaired oxidative stress defence and oxidative phosphorylation dysfunction. Reconstitution of TXN2 expression restored all these parameters, indicating the causal role of TXN2 mutation in disease development. Supplementation with antioxidants effectively suppressed cellular reactive oxygen species production, improved cell viability and mitigated clinical symptoms during short-term follow-up. In conclusion, our report on a patient with TXN2 deficiency suggests an important role of reactive oxygen species homeostasis for human neuronal maintenance and energy metabolism.\n",
      "Short rib polydactyly syndrome (SRPS) type 2 (Majewski syndrome) is a rare inherited, autosomal recessive, lethal skeletal dysplasia characterized by horizontally located short ribs, pre- and postaxial polysyndactyly, and micromelia, with characteristic short ovoid tibiae. There may or may not be visceral involvement. We report a case of SRPS type 2 that was diagnosed by antenatal USG at 28 weeks of gestation; the diagnosis was subsequently confirmed by postnatal radiography, fetal autopsy, and histopathology.\n",
      "We report a patient showing the phenotype described by Kapur and Toriello (Am J Med Genet 41:423-425, 1991) in two sibs. Clinical manifestations include severe mental retardation, cleft lip/palate, and distinctive nose, eye, and intestinal defects. This additional case contributes to a better definition of the apparently new MCA/MR syndrome proposed by Kapur and Toriello.\n",
      "We report on a syndrome of progressive joint stiffness, glaucoma, and lens dislocation observed in three generations and compare it with two previous records of short stature, lens ectopia, and articular limitation. This family confirms the existence of a dominant Weill-Marchesani-like syndrome. We suggest that it could be related to the Moore-Federman syndrome. We coin the acronym GEMSS syndrome (Glaucoma, Ectopia, Microspherophakia, Stiff joints, Short stature) to distinguish this dominant Weill-Marchesani-like syndrome from the classic, recessively inherited syndrome.\n",
      "Four individuals from 2 generations of a family had a hidrotic type of ectodermal dysplasia (ED). Males and females were similarly affected. They had trichodysplasia, with absent eyebrows and eyelashes; normal teeth, onychodysplasia; normal sweating; mild retrognathia; abnormal dermatoglyphics; and mental retardation. Additional variable manifestations included irregular menses, high implanted or prominent ears, caf√É¬©-au-lait spot, keratosis pilaris, supernumerary nipple, and mild hearing loss. Their previously undescribed condition could be classified as an ED of 1-3 (trichoonychial) subgroup of group A according to Freire-Maia's classification and is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait.\n",
      "Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy (FCMD) is frequent in Japan, due to a founder mutation of the fukutin gene (FKTN). Outside Japan, FKTN mutations have only been reported in a few patients with a wide spectrum of phenotypes from Walker-Warburg syndrome to limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD2M). We studied four new Caucasian patients from three unrelated families. All showed raised serum CK initially isolated in one case and muscular dystrophy. Immunohistochemical studies and haplotype analysis led us to search for mutations in FKTN. Two patients (two sisters) presented with congenital muscular dystrophy, mental retardation, and posterior fossa malformation including cysts, and brain atrophy at Brain MRI. The other two patients had normal intelligence and brain MRI. Sequencing of the FKTN gene identified three previously described mutations and two novel missense mutations. Outside Japan, fukutinopathies are associated with a large spectrum of phenotypes from isolated hyperCKaemia to severe CMD, showing a clear overlap with that of FKRP.\n",
      "Vitiligo-spastic syndrome is a very characteristic syndrome that is both clinically and genetically heterogeneous. Most cases have been reported previously in Arab populations. A case in a patient of North European white extraction is reported and compared with previously reported cases.\n",
      "We report clinical observations and cytogenetic studies of an inherited partial trisomy 8q and partial monosomy 18p. A full trisomy 8 syndrome (Warkany syndrome) is a clinically recognized syndrome. Partial trisomy 8q has been reported sporadically in the literature with variable phenotypes. Partial monosomy 18p, deletion of the short arm of chromosome 18, is also a well-recognized syndrome. This is the first report to the best of our knowledge of partial trisomy for distal 8q and partial monosomy for distal 18p occurring together in a patient.\n",
      "We report the clinical and electrophysiologic characteristics of eight patients (four men and four women) with a hereditary neuropathy with probable thermosensitivity (HTN) of autosomal dominant inheritance. Patients presented reversible episodes of ascending muscle weakness, paresthesiae, and areflexia apparently triggered by an elevation of body temperature over 38.5 degrees C. Mean age at onset was 13 +/- 12 (SD; range 6 to 43). Four patients had suffered up to five attacks. EMG and pathologic findings were compatible with a reversible demyelinating neuropathy such as Guillain-Barr√© syndrome. We excluded loci causing other hereditary demyelinating neuropathies, such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type I (CMT type I) and hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP), by linkage analysis; thus, HTN is not allelic to either CMT type I or to HNPP.\n",
      "Four reports have been published on an association between acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and primary lymphedema, with or without congenital deafness. We report seven new cases, including one extended family, confirming this entity as a genetic syndrome. The lymphedema typically presents in one or both lower limbs, before the hematological abnormalities, with onset between infancy and puberty and frequently affecting the genitalia. The AML is often preceded by pancytopenia or myelodysplasia with a high incidence of monosomy 7 in the bone marrow (five propositi and two relatives). Associated anomalies included hypotelorism, epicanthic folds, long tapering fingers and/or neck webbing (four patients), recurrent cellulitis in the affected limb (four patients), generalized warts (two patients), and congenital, high frequency sensorineural deafness (one patient). Children with lower limb and genital lymphedema should be screened for hematological abnormalities and immunodeficiency.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Episodic ataxia (EA) is variably associated with additional neurologic symptoms. At least 4 genes have been implicated. Recently, a mutation in the SLC1A3 gene encoding the glutamate transporter EAAT1 was identified in a patient with severe episodic and progressive ataxia, seizures, alternating hemiplegia, and migraine headache. The mutant EAAT1 showed severely reduced uptake of glutamate. The syndrome was designated EA6 and shares overlapping clinical features with EA2, which is caused by mutations in CACNA1A. OBJECTIVE: To test the role of the SLC1A3 gene in EA. DESIGN: Genetic and functional studies. We analyzed the coding region of the SLC1A3 gene by direct sequencing. SETTING: Academic research. PATIENTS: DNA samples from 20 patients with EA (with or without interictal nystagmus) negative for CACNA1A mutations were analyzed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We identified 1 novel EAAT1 mutation in a family with EA and studied the functional consequences of this mutation using glutamate uptake assay. RESULTS: We identified a missense C186S mutation that segregated with EA in 3 family members. The mutant EAAT1 showed a modest but significant reduction of glutamate uptake. CONCLUSIONS: We broadened the clinical spectrum associated with SLC1A3 mutations to include milder manifestations of EA without seizures or alternating hemiplegia. The severity of EA6 symptoms appears to be correlated with the extent of glutamate transporter dysfunction.\n",
      "Sorsby syndrome is a dominantly inherited combination of bilateral macular colobomas and apical dystrophy of the hands and feet (brachydactyly type B). We report on a further three affected members of the family originally described by Sorsby. Two of these have a single kidney, two have hearing loss, and one has a uterine anomaly.\n",
      "Filippi syndrome is an autosomal recessive condition characterized by syndactyly of fingers and toes, microcephaly, growth retardation and abnormal facies. We are describing a boy who presented with syndactyly, mental retardation, microcephaly, depressed nasal bridge and growth retardation. In addition he had some dental abnormalities like missing bilateral lateral incisors and delayed eruption of teeth. We concluded it to be Filippi syndrome by studying pathognomic clinical features and reviewed the literature. This is the second case report from India.\n",
      "Hyperekplexia is a rare neurogenetic disorder characterized by startle. Accurate diagnosis of this notorious mimicker of epilepsy is important to prevent life-threatening apnoea. We report a novel case of concomitant GLRA1-related hyperkeplexia and myoclonic epilepsy. A toddler with daily paroxysms of head drops and falls presented with epileptic myoclonus on EEG, however, whole-exome sequencing revealed hyperekplexia-related GLRA1 mutation. The boy eventually developed spells induced by noise and surprise. All his spells remitted upon treatment with clonazepam. Paediatricians and paediatric neurologists should be aware of this possible mixed presentation in order to appropriately tailor medication regimens and treatment goals.

      "A previously undescribed fatal multisystem syndrome involving the eyes, ears, lungs, intestines, and kidneys occurred in sibs. They both presented during early childhood with cataracts, otitis media, intestinal malabsorption, chronic respiratory infection, and failure to thrive. Later, they developed recurrent pneumonia (one was shown to have immotile bronchial cilia) and progressive azotemia leading to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) by late childhood. Both died of overwhelming infection (sepsis, meningitis). An autosomal recessive mode of inheritance is proposed since the normal parents were distant cousins, and 4 other sibs were normal.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE:DYT16 is an autosomal recessive dystonia-parkinsonism due to putative mutations at PRKRA gene. The aim of this study was to describe clinical features providing video documentation of patients with DYT16 dystonia. METHODS:We examined and videotaped all homozygous carriers of the DYT16 gene. RESULTS:We identified two phenotypes, generalised dystonia and dystonia-parkinsonism non-responsive to levo-dopa, with three patients belonging to each of the groups. There was inter-individual and intra-family phenotypic heterogeneity. CONCLUSIONS:DYT16 is a rare autosomal recessive dystonia characterised by generalised dystonia or dystonia-parkinsonism. Patients are refractory to pharmacological therapy.\n",
      "In 1983 Sommer described a new syndrome in a mother and her infant daughter which was subsequently called the syndrome of craniofacial, hand anomalies and sensorineural deafness. The syndrome consisted of a normal calvarium with a flat facial profile, hypertelorism and small palpebral fissures with an antimongoloid slant, a depressed nasal bridge with a button tip and slitlike nares and a small \"pursed\" mouth. Profound sensorineural hearing loss and ulnar deviation of the hands with flexion contractures of digits three, four and five was evident. The family had another child, a son, two years after the birth of the index case that had the exact manifestations as his mother and sister. Because of three affected family members in two generations and a phenotype of midfacial anomalies and dystopia canthorum resembling Waardenburg syndrome, a search for mutations in the PAX3 gene was undertaken. A missense mutation in the paired domain of PAX3 (Asn47Lys) was detected. We have provided a 20-year follow-up of a syndrome characterized by craniofacial anomalies, hearing loss and hand deformities and which is caused by a PAX3 missense mutation.\n",
      "Three patients born to the same set of consanguineous parents presented with antenatal skin oedema, hypotonia, cardiomyopathy and tubulopathy. The enzymatic activities of multiple mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes were reduced in muscle. Marked reduction of 12s rRNA, the core of the mitochondrial small ribosomal subunit, was found in fibroblasts. Homozygosity mapping led to the identification of a mutation in the MRPS22 gene, which encodes a mitochondrial ribosomal protein. Transfection of the patient cells with wild-type MRPS22 cDNA increased the 12s rRNA content and normalised the enzymatic activities. Quantification of mitochondrial transcripts is advisable in patients with multiple defects of the mitochondrial respiratory chain.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE: Genomic duplications that lead to autism and other human diseases are interesting pathological lesions since the underlying mechanism almost certainly involves dosage sensitive genes. We aim to understand a novel genomic disorder with profound phenotypic consequences, most notably global developmental delay, autism, psychosis, and anorexia nervosa. METHODS: We evaluated the affected individuals, all maternally related, using childhood autism rating scale (CARS) and Vineland Adaptive scales, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) brain, electroencephalography (EEG), electromyography (EMG), muscle biopsy, high-resolution molecular karyotype arrays, Giemsa banding (G-banding) and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) experiments, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequencing, X-chromosome inactivation study, global gene expression analysis on Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed lymphoblasts, and quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). RESULTS: We have identified a novel Xq12-q13.3 duplication in an extended family. Clinically normal mothers were completely skewed in favor of the normal chromosome X. Global transcriptional profiling of affected individuals and controls revealed significant alterations of genes and pathways in a pattern consistent with previous microarray studies of autism spectrum disorder patients. Moreover, expression analysis revealed copy number-dependent increased messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in affected patients compared to control individuals. A subset of differentially expressed genes was validated using qRT-PCR. INTERPRETATION: Xq12-q13.3 duplication is a novel global developmental delay and autism-predisposing chromosomal aberration; pathogenesis of which may be mediated by increased dosage of genes contained in the duplication, including NLGN3, OPHN1, AR, EFNB1, TAF1, GJB1, and MED12.\n",
      "Clinical immunology has traditionally relied on accurate phenotyping of the patient's immune dysfunction for the identification of a candidate gene or genes for sequencing and molecular confirmation. Although this is also true for other branches of medicine, the marked variability in immune-related phenotypes and the highly complex network of molecules that confer normal host immunity are challenges that clinical immunologists often face in their quest to establish a specific genetic diagnosis.We sought to identify the underlying genetic cause in a consanguineous family with chronic inflammatory bowel disease-like disorder and combined immunodeficiency.We performed exome sequencing followed by autozygome filtration.A truncating mutation in LPS-responsive beige-like anchor (LRBA), which abolished protein expression, was identified as the most likely candidate variant in this family.The combined exome sequencing and autozygosity mapping approach is a powerful tool in the study of atypical immune dysfunctions. We identify LRBA as a novel immunodeficiency candidate gene the precise role of which in the immune system requires future studies.\n",
      "Two siblings with peculiar facies, deafness, cleft palate, male pseudohermaphroditism, and growth and psychomotor retardation were reported. The similarity of both the dysmorphic features and the clinical course suggests a new syndrome, which inheritance is considered to be autosomal recessive.\n",
      "Hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor (HPT-JT) was first observed by Jackson in 1958 in a family who exhibited hyperparathyroidism and recurrent pancreatitis. The author noticed the presence of jaw tumors in the affected family and reported them as fibrous dysplasia. However, it was not until 1990 that a familial variety of hyperparathyroidism with fibro-osseous jaw tumors was recognized as HPT-JT syndrome and reported as a clinically and genetically distinct syndrome. Hyperparathyroidism generally arises from glandular hyperplasia or parathyroid adenomas, with only about 1% of cases resulting from parathyroid carcinoma. However, parathyroid carcinoma develops in about 15% of HPT-JT patients. The true incidence of HPT-JT is unknown, although the prevalence of about 100 published cases suggests its rarity. Twenty percent of HPT-JT cases have renal hamartomas or tumors, and female patients with HPT-JT have been reported to have carcinoma of the uterus. This syndrome appears to arise from a variety of mutations that deactivate the tumor suppressor gene CDC73 (also known as HRPT2) and its production of the tumor suppressor protein parafibromin. Functional parafibromin has 531 amino acids, and mutations result in a short nonfunctional protein. CDC73 disorders exhibit dominant germline gene behavior, with varying degrees of penetration. In most cases an affected person has 1 parent with the condition, which raises the need for family investigation and genetic counseling. We report a case of HPT-JT syndrome in a male patient who presented to the local community hospital 6 years previously with a history of back pain. Investigations showed elevated serum parathyroid hormone and calcium levels, and a technetium 99m sestamibi parathyroid scan showed increased activity at the site of the lower left gland that proved to be a substernal parathyroid carcinoma. The patient's parathyroid hormone level dropped from 126 to 97 pg/mL at 5 minutes and was 65 pg/mL at 10 minutes after excision of the gland, and the calcium chemistry findings returned to normal. Parathyroid histologic analysis showed substantial cytologic atypia with nuclear pleomorphism and prominent nucleoli, but infrequent mitoses. Although the capsule was described as showing foci of vascular invasion by the carcinoma, there has been no evidence of recurrence. Six years later, the patient presented with bilateral mandibular cemento-ossifying fibromas, but no evidence of hyperparathyroidism. The larger left tumor was excised and immediately reconstructed with an autogenous iliac crest bone graft, and the right lesion was enucleated. There has been no recurrence in 12 months. This case illustrates that the hyperparathyroidism and the fibro-osseous tumors are independent features of the persistent germline tumor suppressor gene (CDC73) mutation. The syndromic fibro-osseous tumors are odontogenic cemento-ossifying fibromas, which only occur in the jaws.\n",
      "In this case we report the autopsy findings of a four-month-old boy with the diagnosis of Shwachman-Diamond syndrome. The clinical and pathologic findings are discussed with emphasis on the differential diagnosis of cystic fibrosis and a brief review of current literature.\n",
      "PPP3CA encodes calmodulin-binding catalytic subunit of calcineurin, a ubiquitously expressed calcium/calmodulin-regulated protein phosphatase. Recently de novo PPP3CA variants were reported as a cause of disease in 12 subjects presenting with epileptic encephalopathy and dysmorphic features. We describe a boy with similar phenotype and severe early onset epileptic encephalopathy in whom a novel de novo c.1324C>T (p.(Gln442Ter)) PPP3CA variant was found by whole exome sequencing. Western blot experiments in patient's cells (EBV transformed lymphocytes and neuronal cells derived through reprogramming) indicate that despite normal mRNA abundance the protein expression level is strongly reduced both for the mutated and wild-type protein. By in vitro studies with recombinant protein expressed in E. coli we show that c.1324C>T (p.(Gln442Ter)) results in constitutive activation of the enzyme. Our results confirm the role of PPP3CA defects in pathogenesis of a distinct neurodevelopmental disorder including severe epilepsy and dysmorphism and provide further functional clues regarding the pathogenic mechanism.\n",
      "A syndrome with distinctive facies, poor muscle tone, absent deep tendon reflexes, tapered fingers, excessive fingerprint arches, genu valgum and mild-moderate mental retardation has occurred in four males in two generations of a white family of European ancestry. The facies are characterised by square configuration, tented upper lip, and thickening of the helices, upper eyelids, and alae nasi. At birth and at maturity, growth (head circumference, height, weight) of affected males is comparable to or greater than unaffected male sibs. Moderate impairment of cognitive function was documented (IQ scores between 40-51). Carriers show no heterozygote manifestations. This X linked condition appears to be different from other syndromes with mental retardation, although there are certain similarities with the alpha thalassaemia-mental retardation syndrome (ATR-X). Linkage analysis found tight linkage to DXS1166 and DXS995 in Xq13 and Xq21 respectively.\n",
      "Circumscribed palmar or plantar hypokeratosis is a rare dermatosis characterized by a solitary, well-circumscribed patch with scaly borders chiefly on the palm or sole; it usually occurs in middle-aged or elderly women. We report the case of a 52-year-old Korean woman with two characteristic lesions of circumscribed palmar hypokeratosis on the left palm. Clinically, the lesions simulated porokeratosis of Mibelli, but histologically there was no cornoid lamellation in the serial sections and there were the characteristic histopathological features of circumscribed palmar or plantar hypokeratosis including a stair-like configuration with an abrupt thinning of the stratum corneum and a decreased granular layer. We also review the 16 cases of circumscribed palmar or plantar hypokeratosis reported in the published work.\n",
      "Two sisters are described with a disorder characterised by mental retardation, congenital cataract, progressive spinocerebellar ataxia, sensorineural deafness, and signs of peripheral neuropathy. Progressive hearing loss, ataxia, and polyneuropathy became evident in the third decade. The differential diagnosis of this syndrome is discussed including the syndromes described by Berman et al and Koletzko et al.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Mutations in genes coding for 2 desmosomal proteins, desmoglein 1 and desmoplakin, have been shown to cause autosomal dominant keratoderma palmoplantaris striata. OBSERVATIONS: We describe a family affected with a diffuse nonstriated form of palmoplantar keratoderma. Histopathologic examination of skin biopsy specimens disclosed cell-cell disadhesion in the suprabasal layers of the epidermis, as previously described in keratoderma palmoplantaris striata. We therefore genotyped all family members using microsatellite markers encompassing 3 keratoderma palmoplantaris striata-associated loci. Haplotype analysis suggested linkage of the disease to 18q12.1, which harbors the DSG1 gene, encoding desmoglein 1. Mutation analysis eventually led to the identification of a causative recurrent nonsense mutation in this gene. CONCLUSIONS: Mutations in DSG1 are not exclusively associated with striated palmoplantar keratoderma. The present study illustrates the efficacy of an integrative diagnostic approach to palmoplantar keratodermas involving clinical assessment, pathologic examination, microsatellite marker screening, and mutational analysis.\n",
      "Recently a distinct spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia (SEMD) was reported in three members of a Jewish family. We present a 3.5-year-old Mexican boy with disproportionate short stature, peculiar face, short neck, small chest, abdominal distension, lumbar lordosis, short limbs, marked genua vara, and joint laxity. Roentgenologic findings include short long bones, wide and flared metaphyses with irregularities, delayed epiphyseal ossification, platyspondyly and morphological changes of vertebral bodies and fibular overgrowth. The striking resemblance of this patient to those previously reported confirms this form of SEMD as a distinct entity. Autosomal recessive inheritance is supported and the designation SEMD Shohat type is proposed.\n",
      "Based on two independent personal cases and a pair of sibs from the literature, we delineate a new category of bone dysplasia with cup-shaped large metaphyses, for which the name metaphyseal acroscyphodysplasia is suggested. The main clinical features are severe growth retardation, micromelia predominating in the lower limbs, knee flexion, and severe brachydactyly. The radiological aspect of the knees is very specific: the lower femoral and upper tibial epiphyses embed themselves in their metaphyses, which are severely cup-shaped. Premature central epiphyso-metaphyseal fusion and gross deformation, or even coalescence, of the femoral condyles may occur. The femoral diaphyses are very short and broad, and there is progressive coxa valga. Bowed and/or short stubby tibiae with cone-shaped metaphyses, and varus deformity of the tibio-astragalian joint are other features. Slight deformations of the long bones occur in the upper limb. Severe brachydactyly, brachymesophalangy, phalangeal and metacarpal cone-shaped epiphyses and irregular, bent and shortened diaphyses are the main signs of hand involvement. Psychomotor retardation is present in 3/4. Autosomal recessive inheritance is likely.\n",
      "This is a report of an additional patient affected by hemifacial myohyperplasia (HMH). We postulate that this condition originates around the fourth gestational week at any step of cranial muscle development from somitomeres to branchial arches, most probably due to prolonged period of proliferation during cranial muscle development, subsequent abnormal contact between cranial neural crest (CNC) cells and cranial myoblasts, and an impaired interaction among CNC cells and cranial myoblasts derivatives. HMH may represent another example of somatic mosaicism and its features can be explained by a combination of morphostatic and morphodynamic mechanisms of pattern formation during development. Here we suggest that HMH is a sequence in which the primary defect is hyperplasia of the facial muscles and the other findings are secondary to this.\n",
      "Familial cutaneous collagenoma is an inherited condition characterized by the presence of multiple dermal nodules symmetrically distributed on the trunk and upper arms. In this study, six patients, the proband, his four siblings and a niece, representing a kindred of fifty-two subjects, were examined for aymptomatic cutaneous nodules mainly on the back and chest. The individual lesions varying from a few millimetres to several centimetres in size, were indurated, and showed minimal epidermal changes. Histologically, the nodules were characterized by an excessive accumulation of dense, coarse collagen fibres in the dermis. The elastic fibres appeared diminished in number, and in some areas they were abnormally thin and fragmented. The lesions, therefore, were connective tissue naevi of the collagen type. On the basis of the family history and histological observations the patients were diagnosed as having familial cutaneous collagenoma. Examination of the family pedigree indicated that the dermal nodules in familial cutaneous collagenoma were inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. It was also observed that the lesions had an onset at the age of 15 to 19 years, and their number increased significantly during pregnancy. It is conceivable that familial cutaneous collagenoma is an inherited condition whose expression may be under a hormonal control.\n",
      "We report on a 58-year old woman with microcephaly, mild dysmorphic features, bilateral keratoconus, digital abnormalities, short stature and mild cognitive delay. Except for keratoconus, the phenotype was suggestive for Feingold syndrome type 2 (FGLDS2, MIM 614326), a rare autosomal dominant disorder described in six patients worldwide, due to the haploinsufficiency of MIR17HG, a micro RNA encoding gene. Karyotype showed a de novo deletion on chromosome 13q, further defined by array-Comparative Genomic Hybridization (a-CGH) to a 17.2-Mb region. The deletion included MIR17HG, as expected by the FGLDS2 phenotype, and twelve genes from the keratoconus type 7 locus. Because our patient presented with keratoconus, we propose she further refines disease genes at this locus. Among previously suggested candidates, we exclude DOCK9 and STK24, and propose as best candidates IPO5, DNAJC3, MBNL2 and RAP2A. In conclusion, we report a novel phenotypic association of Feingold syndrome type 2 and keratoconus, a likely contiguous gene syndrome due to a large genomic deletion on 13q spanning MIR17HG and a still to be identified gene for keratoconus.\n",
      "Two brothers aged 75 and 61 years, born from non-consanguineous non-affected parents, had spinocerebellar ataxia and impaired proprioception in the lower limbs, associated with sensorineural deafness, amyotrophy of the hands and spastic paraparesis. The older patient also had vitiligo of the right hand, and both displayed likely dysendocrine features. The disease was present since the second-third decade and showed a slow course. An EMG confirmed a neurogenic disorder strictly localized to the distal upper limbs. This new phenotype of heredoataxia is compared with previously reported similar syndromes and, in particular, with diseases featuring localized amyotrophy of the hands.\n",
      "Two patients with triphalangeal thumbs-ectrodactyly syndrome are described. The first case is a 4-year-old female with triphalangeal thumbs, preaxial polydactyly with rudimentary polydactyly of the 3rd finger of the right hand and ectro-syndactyly of feet. Her stillborn sister had triphalangeal thumbs and ectrodactyly of feet. The mother has triphalangeal thumbs, brachy-syndactyly of the left foot and ectro-syndactyly of the right one. The maternal grandmother has syndactyly of 1st, 2nd, 3rd toes and hypoplasia of the 3rd toe on the right foot. The second case is sporadic and shows triphalangeal thumbs, preaxial polydactyly of the right hand and bilateral lobster-claw feet. Our observations confirm the variability of clinical expression and support the autosomal dominant inheritance of the syndrome.\n",
      "We describe a proband and his mother who appear to have a new dominant syndrome of mental retardation: pterygium colli, unusual features, and digital anomalies. The craniofacial abnormalities include brachycephaly, epicanthus inversus, angulated eyebrows, upward slanting of the palpebral fissures, ptosis, hypertelorism, and prominent low set, posteriorly rotated ears. The digits are remarkable for proximally displaced small thumbs, widened interphalangeal joints, and broad terminal phalanges.\n",
      "IMPORTANCE: To provide clinical and genetic diagnoses for patients' conditions, it is important to identify and characterize the different subtypes of spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA). OBJECTIVE: To clinically and genetically characterize a Spanish kindred with pure SCA presenting with altered vertical eye movements. DESIGN Family study of ambulatory patients. Electro-oculographic and genetics studies were performed in 2 referral university centers. SETTING: Primary care institutional center in Spain. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-six participants from a large Spanish kindred were clinically examined, and 33 family members were genetically examined. Detailed clinical data were obtained from 9 affected relatives. Two ataxic siblings and 2 asymptomatic family members were examined using an enhanced clinical protocol for a follow-up period of 7 years. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: High-density genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays, along with microsatellite analysis, and genetic linkage studies were performed. Whole-exome sequencing was used for 2 affected relatives. For most patients, the initial symptoms included falls, dysarthria, or clumsiness followed by a complete cerebellar syndrome. For all 9 affected relatives, we observed altered vertical eye movements, as initial ocular signs for 3 of them and for the 2 asymptomatic family members, all having inherited the risk haplotype. Neuroimaging showed isolated cerebellar atrophy. RESULTS: Initial genome-wide linkage analysis revealed suggestive linkage to chromosome 1p32. Multipoint analysis and haplotype reconstruction further traced this SCA locus to a 0.66-cM interval flanked by D1S200 and D1S2742 (z(max) = 6.539; P < .0001). The causative mutation was unidentified by exome sequencing. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: We report a new subtype of SCA presenting in patients as slow progressing ataxia with altered vertical eye movements linked to a 11-megabase interval on 1p32. The Human Genome Nomenclature Committee has assigned this subtype of ataxia the designation SCA37.\n",
      "We present two new patients with the recently described mitochondrial m.3242G > A mutation. Although the mutation is situated next to the well known m.3243A > G mutation, the most common alteration associated with mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome, the clinical presentation is quite different, but characteristic. All three m.3242G > A patients presented in the neonatal period with hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathy, generalized muscle hypotonia and lactic acidosis. Two additionally had creatine kinase elevation, renal tubular acidosis/dysfunction and showed a mild clinical course with a favourable psychomotor development. The third patient had more neurological involvement and died in infancy. The mutation occurred de novo in the two patients where maternal investigations were performed. The combination of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and renal tubular acidosis/renal tubular dysfunction is clinically distinctive and may represent a separate entity.\n",
      "Two sisters with autosomal recessive cerebellar hypoplasia and severe nonprogressive retinal pigmentary disease are presented. This syndrome has been previously described in only 1 patient. The retinal changes may be difficult to discern and we suggest that all patients with congenital ataxia have a detailed ophthalmologic assessment, including electroretinography.\n",
      "An oculocerebral hypopigmentation syndrome consisting of growth retardation, dolichocephaly, cataracts, high arched palate, small, widely spaced teeth, generalized hypopigmentation, psychomotor retardation, progressive neurological manifestations and hypochromic anemia is described in sibs. The finding of parental consanguinity supports autosomal recessive inheritance. The syndrome resembles the Cross syndrome (1,2).\n",
      "Approximately 5% of patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) have deletions of the entire NF1 gene. The phenotype usually includes early onset, large number of neurofibromas, presence of congenital anomalies, cognitive deficiency, and variable dysmorphic features and growth abnormalities. Connective tissue abnormalities are not generally recognised as a part of NF1 microdeletion syndrome, but mitral valve prolapse, joint laxity, and/or soft skin on the palms have been reported in a few patients. We describe clinical findings in six newly diagnosed patients with NF1 microdeletions, five of whom presented with connective tissue abnormalities. A literature review of the clinical findings associated with NF1 microdeletion was also performed. Our report confirms that connective tissue dysplasia is common in patients with NF1 microdeletions. Given the potential for associated cardiac manifestation, screening by echocardiogram may be warranted. Despite the large number (>150) of patients with known NF1 microdeletions, the clinical phenotype remains incompletely defined. Additional reports of patients with NF1 microdeletions, including comprehensive clinical and molecular information, are needed to elucidate possible genotype-phenotype correlation.\n",
      "A 50-year-old man (the proband) experienced recurring attacks of ocular irritation and had had bilateral ring-shaped anterior corneal opacity since adolescence. Corneal sensation was normal. The proband's 15-year-old daughter also had recurring episodes of ocular irritation and bilateral fleck-like anterior corneal opacities. The proband's deceased father and brother reportedly had similar corneal lesions from adolescence. We believe that the corneal findings in this family may be similar to those found in patients with the Grayson-Wilbrandt variant of Reis-B√ºcklers' corneal dystrophy.\n",
      "PURPOSE:A small case series with a neurodegenerative disorder involving central nervous system and related to Seipin mutations was recently reported. Herein we describe clinical and EEG features of three patients presenting with Progressive Myoclonus Epilepsy (PME) and Congenital Generalized Lipodystrophy type 2 (CGL2) related to novel Seipin mutations. METHODS:The EEG-clinical picture was evaluated at epilepsy onset and in the follow-up period. The molecular analysis of BSCL2, Laforin and Malin genes was performed to patients and/or their parents by Denaturing High Performance Liquid Chromatography and automated nucleotide sequencing. Skin specimens collected from a patient were processed for histochemical and ultrastructural analysis. RESULTS:The CGL2-PME syndrome co-segregated with two different BSCL2 genotypes: the homozygosity for c.782_783dupG involving exon 8 (two cases), or the compound heterozygosity for c.782_783dupG/c.828_829delAA (one case). Periodic-Acid Schiff positive osmiophilic material in the cytoplasm of fibrocytes and eccrine-gland cells were found in skin specimens. The lack of Lafora's bodies in skin specimens and the molecular analysis excluding mutations in Laforin and Malin genes ruled out Lafora disease. CONCLUSION:The spectrum of CGL2 associated to BSCL2 gene mutations may include PMEs. Selected mutations in BSCL2 gene seem to be related to PMEs in patients with CGL2 phenotype.\n",
      "Acro-dermato-ungual-lacrimal-tooth (ADULT) syndrome is a rare, autosomal dominant form of ectodermal dysplasia due to TP63 mutations. ADULT syndrome is much less common than the more classical forms of TP63-associated ectodermal dysplasias, such as ectrodactyly-ectodermal dysplasia-cleft lip/palate (EEC) syndrome and ankyloblepharon-ectodermal defects-cleft lip/palate syndrome. ADULT syndrome is characterized by ectrodactyly, syndactyly, and excessive freckling, in addition to more typical ectodermal defects, including hypodontia, lacrimal duct anomalies, hypotrichosis, and onychodysplasia. Unlike some of the other TP63-associated ectodermal dysplasias, ADULT syndrome lacks clefting and ankyloblepharon. Here, we report a three-generation family with ADULT syndrome due to an R243W mutation in TP63, a mutation that has previously been described in one patient with ADULT syndrome and eight unrelated patients with EEC syndrome.\n",
      "A new 7p22.1 microduplication syndrome characterized by intellectual disability, speech delay and craniofacial dysmorphisms, such as macrocephaly, hypertelorism and ear anomalies, has been outlined by the description of two patients with interstitial microduplications confined to 7p22.1 and the recently defined minimal overlapping 430¬†kb critical region including five genes. Here we report on the first adult patient aged 35 years with moderate intellectual disability, psychomotor delay, facial dysmorphisms, cryptorchidism and cardiac anomalies, who carries two close microduplications at 7p22.1 of about 900 and 150¬†kb, respectively. The proximal smaller duplication includes three coding genes and maps outside the minimal described overlapping duplicated region, while the larger one represents the smallest 7p22.1 microduplication reported so far, as it encompasses the entire minimal region with only four additional genes. We compare the phenotype of our patient with that of the few reported cases and discuss on candidate genes in order to enhance the knowledge on genotype-phenotype correlation in 7p22.1 duplication syndrome.\n",
      "Seven members from three generations of a Saudi family presented with porokeratosis punctata palmaris et plantaris (PPPP). In our series of patients, the disorder began in their early 20s, seemed to be transmitted as a dominant trait, and affected males only. The elementary lesion was a tiny keratotic spine, and the involvement was strictly limited to the volar aspects of the hands and to the soles of the feet. Histological studies showed a columnar parakeratosis that resembled the cornoid lamella of porokeratosis, but other clinical and histological traits tended to make PPPP an entity that was distinct from true porokeratosis. There have been only six reports in the literature on genuine PPPP before this series.\n",
      "We describe 2 brothers with congenital microcephaly and moderately severe mental retardation. The presence of identical and symmetrical digital anomalies suggests that this constellation represents a clinically recognizable recessively inherited mental retardation syndrome. Recognition of the clinical diagnosis should provide accurate genetic counseling to parents of a single affected child.\n",
      "Eight mutations in the ALS2 gene have been described as causing autosomal-recessive juvenile-onset forms of the motor neuron diseases amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, primary lateral sclerosis and hereditary spastic paraplegia. All mutations are small deletions that are predicted to result in a frameshift and premature truncation of the alsin protein. Here we describe a ninth ALS2 mutation, in two siblings affected by infantile-onset ascending spastic paraplegia with bulbar involvement. This mutation is predicted to result in the substitution of an amino acid by a stop codon, and thus is the first nonsense mutation detected in this gene. It is probable that full-length alsin is required for the proper development and/or functioning of upper motor neurons.\n",
      "AIMS:To establish a clinical and molecular diagnosis in a family with late onset lattice corneal dystrophy. METHODS:Linkage analysis, single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis, and direct sequencing of genomic DNA were performed. A review of the patients' clinical symptoms and signs was undertaken. RESULTS:Linkage to chromosome 9q34 was established and a mutation in the gelsolin gene was found in affected individuals. Numerous symptoms experienced by the patients were attributable to this mutation. CONCLUSION:A diagnosis of amyloidosis type V (familial amyloidosis, Finnish type, FAF/Meretoja syndrome/gelsolin related amyloidosis) was made. This is the first case of amyloidosis type V described in the UK. This emphasises the importance of recognition of the extraocular manifestations of eye disease both in the diagnosis and management of the patient. In addition, these findings can help molecular geneticists in their search for disease-causing mutations.\n",
      "Two brothers are described with a syndrome characterized by mental retardation, atypical absence, atonic and generalized tonic-clonic seizures, and bilateral symmetrical slow spike and wave discharges on electroencephalograms. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed dysplastic cortex probably representing pachygyria primarily over the parietal regions bilaterally in both patients. The presence of an identical clinical, electroencephalographic, and cortical developmental abnormality on imaging studies in these brothers suggests that a genetic mechanism may play a role in some developmental disorders of the cerebral cortex.\n",
      "We present prenatal and postnatal features of a patient with severe achondroplasia with developmental delay and acanthosis nigricans (SADDAN). Mutation analysis confirmed the clinical diagnosis by detecting the FGFR3 Lys650Met mutation. This case, one of only six with molecular analysis reported in the literature, confirms the severe morbidity and adds to the reports with early mortality associated with SADDAN. Clinical-radiological characteristics of all reported cases of SADDAN are reviewed and discussed.\n",
      "The increasing use of array-CGH in malformation syndromes with intellectual disability could lead to the description of new contiguous gene syndrome by the analysis of the gene content of the microdeletion and reverse phenotyping. Thanks to a national and international call for collaboration by Achropuce and Decipher, we recruited four patients carrying de novo overlapping deletions of chromosome 9q33.3q34.11, including the STXBP1, the LMX1B and the ENG genes. We restrained the selection to these three genes because the effects of their haploinsufficency are well described in the literature and easily recognizable clinically. All deletions were detected by array-CGH and confirmed by FISH. The patients display common clinical features, including intellectual disability with epilepsy, owing to the presence of STXBP1 within the deletion, nail dysplasia and bone malformations, in particular patellar abnormalities attributed to LMX1B deletion, epistaxis and cutaneous-mucous telangiectasias explained by ENG haploinsufficiency and common facial dysmorphism. This systematic analysis of the genes comprised in the deletion allowed us to identify genes whose haploinsufficiency is expected to lead to disease manifestations and complications that require personalized follow-up, in particular for renal, eye, ear, vascular and neurological manifestations.\n",
      "A 31-year-old male patient with ectodermal dysplasia and acanthosis nigricans is described. Clinical findings included hypotrichosis, hypohidrosis, palmoplantar hyperkeratosis, nail dystrophy, early onset loss of permanent dentition, mental retardation, and acanthosis nigricans. The findings suggest the diagnosis of Lelis syndrome, as described on the basis of seven unrelated cases. A review concerning this condition is also presented.\n",
      "Griscelli syndrome (GS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutation in the MYO5A (GS1), RAB27A (GS2), and MLPH (GS3) genes, characterized by a common feature, partial albinism. The common variant of three, GS type 2, in addition, shows primary immunodeficiency which leads to recurrent infections and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. We, herewith, describe a case of GS type 2, in a 4-year-old male child who presented with chronic and recurrent fever, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and secondary neurological deterioration; highlighting the cytological and histopathological features of lymph nodes. Hair shaft examination of the child confirmed the diagnosis.\n",
      "The human zona pellucida is composed of four glycoproteins (ZP1, ZP2, ZP3, and ZP4) and has an important role in reproduction. Here we describe a form of infertility with an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance, characterized by abnormal eggs that lack a zona pellucida. We identified a homozygous frameshift mutation in ZP1 in six family members. In vitro studies showed that defective ZP1 proteins and normal ZP3 proteins colocalized throughout the cells and were not expressed at the cell surface, suggesting that the aberrant ZP1 results in the sequestration of ZP3 in the cytoplasm, thereby preventing the formation of the zona pellucida around the oocyte.\n",
      "Congenital or acquired cellular deficiencies in humans have the potential to reveal much about normal hematopoiesis and immune function. We show that a recently described syndrome of monocytopenia, B and NK lymphoid deficiency additionally includes the near absence of dendritic cells. Four subjects showed severe depletion of the peripheral blood HLA-DR(+) lineage(-) compartment, with virtually no CD123(+) or CD11c(+) dendritic cells (DCs) and very few CD14(+) or CD16(+) monocytes. The only remaining HLA-DR(+) lineage(-) cells were circulating CD34(+) progenitor cells. Dermal CD14(+) and CD1a(+) DC were also absent, consistent with their dependence on blood-derived precursors. In contrast, epidermal Langerhans cells and tissue macrophages were largely preserved. Combined loss of peripheral DCs, monocytes, and B and NK lymphocytes was mirrored in the bone marrow by complete absence of multilymphoid progenitors and depletion of granulocyte-macrophage progenitors. Depletion of the HLA-DR(+) peripheral blood compartment was associated with elevated serum fms-like tyrosine kinase ligand and reduced circulating CD4(+)CD25(hi)FoxP3(+) T cells, supporting a role for DC in T reg cell homeostasis.\n",
      "Here, we report the case of an incidental finding of lamellar calcification of the falx cerebri in a routine computed tomography scan of the head after an accidental trauma. This lamellar calcification led to the diagnosis of Gorlin-Goltz syndrome (GGS) in the patient and her daughter. Lamellar calcification of the falx cerebri is a pathognomonic feature of GGS. Our case report highlights the importance of a multidisciplinary diagnostic approach to GGS.\n",
      "In 1983, Fitzsimmons et al. reported four brothers with an unrecognized disorder characterized by intellectual disability, spastic paraplegia, and palmo-plantar hyperkeratosis (OMIM 309500). In this report, we describe a family in which two males, maternal half-brothers, had learning disabilities. Both patients also showed spasticity in the lower limbs and palmo-plantar hyperkeratosis. The mother of the affected boys had learning difficulties but did not show any dermatological symptoms. This report confirms that the association of features reported by Fitzsimmons et al. is a distinct entity and further suggests an X-linked mode of inheritance.\n",
      "We report on a consanguineous family with 6 children (out of 7) affected by a spondylo-ocular syndrome. Clinical features include cataract, loss of vision due to retinal detachment, facial dysmorphism, facial hypotonia, normal height with disproportional short trunk, immobile spine with thorakal kyphosis and reduced lumbal lordosis. On ophthalmological examination of the index patient, a dense cataract and complete retinal detachment could be detected on the right eye. On the left eye, an absent lens nucleus was found, but no retinal detachment. On radiological examination, there was generalized moderate osteoporosis; the spine showed marked platyspondyly and the bone age was advanced. On laboratory investigations, a normal excretion of amino acids, mucopolysaccharides and oligosaccharides could be found. The phenotypical spectrum observed in the 6 affected individuals was rather uniform. The karyotype was normal in all affected children. This hitherto undescribed combination of oculo-skeletal symptoms shows most resemblance with connective tissue disorders, suggesting a range of candidate genes for mutation analysis.\n",
      "We report five members of a family with dacryocystitis associated with osteopoikilosis. The inheritance is autosomal dominant. Review of the literature revealed no other report of this kind of association. Osteopoikilosis must not be considered as a coincidental radiographic finding but as part of a systemic disorder.\n",
      "Developmental glaucoma can occur as an isolated or syndromic condition and is genetically heterogeneous. We describe a three-generation family affected with developmental glaucoma, myopia, and/or retinal defects associated with variable craniofacial/dental, auditory, brain, renal, and limb anomalies. Whole-exome sequencing identified a heterozygous c.124T>√Ç¬†C, p.(Trp42Arg) allele in ADAMTSL1; cosegregation analysis confirmed the presence of this allele in four affected family members. The mutation affects a highly conserved residue and is strongly predicted to have a deleterious effect on protein function. Trp42 is normally modified by protein C-mannosylation, an unusual post-translational modification. Comparison of ADAMTSL1-WT (also known as punctin-1) and ADAMTSL1-p.Trp42Arg in vitro demonstrated that the latter was not secreted from transfected cells but retained intracellularly. Moreover, ADAMTSL1-p.Trp42Arg reduced secretion of cotransfected wild-type ADAMTSL1, suggesting a dominant negative effect for this mutation. These data imply a multisystem role for ADAMTSL1 and present the first disease-associated variant affecting a C-mannosylation motif.\n",
      "We report on a case of apparent germline mosaicism in a family of two sisters carrying a novel 19p13.13 deletion. The 11-year-old proposita was referred for evaluation of macrocephaly, moderate intellectual disability (ID), and episodic ataxia. Array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) detected a 399√¢‚Ç¨‚Ä∞kb microdeletion with breakpoints within genes NFIX and CACNA1A. A similar deletion was also seen in the elder sibling who presented with macrocephaly, ID, and strabismus. The deletions were confirmed to be de novo after the parental aCGH analysis suggesting that this is an example of germinal mosaicism. This study contributes additional information for the newly identified 19p13 deletion syndrome and clarifies the clinical roles of genes in the involved region. This case of apparent germline mosaicism represents the only known family in the cohort of 1,800 patients analyzed by our group.\n",
      "Array CGH (comparative genomic hybridization) screening of large patient cohorts with mental retardation and/or multiple congenital anomalies (MR/MCA) has led to the identification of a number of new microdeletion and microduplication syndromes. Recently, a recurrent copy number variant (CNV) at chromosome 16p11.2 was reported to occur in up to 1% of autistic patients in three large autism studies. In the screening of 4284 patients with MR/MCA with various array platforms, we detected 22 individuals (14 index patients and 8 family members) with deletions in 16p11.2, which are genomically identical to those identified in the autism studies. Though some patients shared a facial resemblance and a tendency to overweight, there was no evidence for a recognizable phenotype. Autism was not the presenting feature in our series. The assembled evidence indicates that recurrent 16p11.2 deletions are associated with variable clinical outcome, most likely arising from haploinsufficiency of one or more genes. The phenotypical spectrum ranges from MR and/or MCA, autism, learning and speech problems, to a normal phenotype.\n",
      "We report a boy who presented with mild mandibulofacial dysostosis, growth retardation with microcephaly, bilateral hearing loss, thoracic deformity with a cardiac valvular lesion and bilateral cryptorchidism. The pattern of malformations differs from the classical Treacher Collins syndrome. We consider it to be mandibulofacial dysostosis (MFD), Toriello type with some additional features.\n",
      "We present prenatal diagnosis and molecular genetic analysis of mosaic trisomy 17 and a review of the literature of mosaic trisomy 17 at amniocentesis.A 42-year-old woman underwent amniocentesis at 17¬†weeks of gestation because of advanced maternal age, which revealed a karyotype of 47,XX,+17[4]/46,XX[17]. Prenatal ultrasound findings were unremarkable. She underwent repeat amniocentesis at 20¬†weeks of gestation. Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), array comparative genomic hybridization, and quantitative fluorescent polymerase chain reaction assays were applied to uncultured amniocytes. Conventional cytogenetic analysis was applied to cultured amniocytes and cord blood. Interphase FISH was applied to uncultured urinary cells postnatally.At repeat amniocentesis, molecular genetic analysis of uncultured amniocytes revealed no genomic imbalance in array comparative genomic hybridization, no uniparental disomy 17 in quantitative fluorescent polymerase chain reaction, and 4.7% (5/105¬†cells) mosaic trisomy 17 in interphase FISH analysis. Conventional cytogenetic analysis of cultured amniocytes revealed a karyotype of 46,XX (17/17 colonies). A phenotypically normal baby was delivered at 38¬†weeks of gestation. The cord blood had a karyotype of 46,XX. Interphase FISH analysis of uncultured urinary cells revealed 5.6% (5/90¬†cells) mosaic trisomy 17. The neonate manifested normal growth and psychomotor development during follow-ups.Low-level mosaicism for trisomy 17 detected by amniocentesis without ultrasound abnormality can be associated with a favorable outcome. Molecular genetic analysis of uncultured amniocytes at repeat amniocentesis is useful for genetic counseling. A review of the literature shows a correlation between an adverse fetal outcome and a higher trisomy 17 mosaicism level at amniocentesis associated with ultrasound abnormality.\n",
      "To clarify the phenotypic variability of Coffin-Siris syndrome, we present a review of the literature and 18 new cases. We performed a questionnaire study of patients ascertained through an international support group. Information on their sibs was available for comparison. The most frequent findings include some degree of mental retardation or developmental delay, \"coarse\" facial appearance, feeding difficulties, frequent infections, and hypoplastic to absent fifth fingernails and fifth distal phalanges. We discuss the key manifestations for diagnosis, medical and developmental implications, and possible pathogenesis.\n",
      "The NONO protein has been characterized as an important transcriptional regulator in diverse cellular contexts. Here we show that loss of NONO function is a likely cause of human intellectual disability and that NONO-deficient mice have cognitive and affective deficits. Correspondingly, we find specific defects at inhibitory synapses, where NONO regulates synaptic transcription and gephyrin scaffold structure. Our data identify NONO as a possible neurodevelopmental disease gene and highlight the key role of the DBHS protein family in functional organization of GABAergic synapses.\n",
      "Colobomatous macrophthalmia with microcornea syndrome (MIM 602499) is a very rare eye malformation. To date, only two families with a total number of eight patients have been reported. We report on 13 additional cases in a single three-generation family and describe the eye findings and quantitative parameters of corneal curvature and axial ocular dimensions. All affected relatives had bilateral involvement with typical inferonasal iris coloboma, chorioretinal coloboma, microcornea, and varying degrees of axial enlargement associated with myopia. Additional findings included flatter corneal curvatures and shallower anterior chambers. Iridocorneal angle abnormalities associated with elevation of intraocular pressure were detected in three patients. The pedigree confirms the autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance with complete penetrance.\n",
      "Congenital agenesis of the scrotum and labia majora is very exceptional. To date, only 6 cases of scrotal agenesis have been reported. To our knowledge, the anomalies of the labioscrotal folds in siblings have not yet been reported. We report the complete agenesis of the scrotum and labia majora within the 3 members of the same family. Additionally, successful reconstruction of the neoscrotum was performed for the first time for congenital scrotal agenesis.\n",
      "We report two cases of an axial osteosclerosis with histopathologic findings of osteomesopyknosis in siblings. Osteomesopyknosis is a benign hereditary osteosclerosis that can show a radiologic pattern similar to blastic metastatic disease. The aim of this article is to inform radiologists about the existence of this benign condition and its various radiologic manifestations. Therefore, we discuss the principal differential diagnosis and point out the key imaging findings of osteomesopyknosis in order to avoid overdiagnosis in future cases.\n",
      "Thyroglossal duct cysts are one of the most commonly encountered benign neck lumps found in the paediatric population. Despite their relative frequency, reports of familial inheritance are rare. A total of 21 patients with hereditary thyroglossal duct cysts from seven families worldwide have been reported. The most common inheritance pattern is dominant, with a minority possibly representing a recessive aetiology. We describe a further instance of dominantly inherited thyroglossal duct cysts in two generations.\n",
      "We describe two females (aunt and niece) with variable manifestations of arhinia, choanal atresia, microphthalmia, and hypertelorism. In the literature there is only one report on this syndrome in sibs. We hypothesize autosomal dominant inheritance with reduced penetrance.\n",
      "In Finland, 3 patients have been diagnosed with Nager syndrome (NS) during the last 17 years. Thus the incidence for NS in Finland is 3:1,000,000. The craniofacial structures and dental development of these patients were studied clinically and radiographically at the age of 3-4 years, and compared to age-matched controls and to the norms of the Finnish population. The striking structural finding was a severely short, retrognathic and posteriorly rotated mandible. Especially the ramus was deficient; its height was, on average, less than one-third of that of the control group. All children were tracheostomized neonatally. At the age of 3-4, the lower pharyngeal airway was still severely obstructed or completely closed. Nasopharyngeal airway was wide and the soft palate was missing in all patients. All patients had a complete deciduous dentition, but agenesis of permanent teeth (ranging from 2-10 missing teeth) was observed in each patient. Accelerated dental development was found in two subjects. Condylar ankylosis or severely limited mouth opening were observed. The present findings give new information and quantify earlier observations of craniofacial structures and dental development in NS. Analysis of facial structures suggests that if surgical intervention is needed to enable better breathing, the goal of the structural correction should be aimed at the most deficient structure, namely the ramus height. As a result of severe dentofacial deviation, a treatment process through the growth requires multidisciplinary teamwork of surgeons, pediatrists, orthodontists and prosthodontists.\n",
      "We report on two sibs, brother and sister, with a multiple congenital anomaly/mental retardation syndrome consisting of severe growth and mental retardation, seizures, retinal abnormalities, osteodysplasia, brachydactyly, prognathism, and dental malocclusion. These clinical findings were present in both patients and seem to be consistent with the phenotype of the Gurrieri syndrome. The new features described in these sibs could expand the clinical spectrum of the Gurrieri syndrome and confirm the existence of this rare autosomal recessive condition.\n",
      "Cytosolic phospholipase A2alpha (cPLA2alpha) hydrolyzes arachidonic acid from cellular membrane phospholipids, thereby providing enzymatic substrates for the synthesis of eicosanoids, such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Considerable understanding of cPLA2alpha function has been derived from investigations of the enzyme and from cPLA2alpha-null mice, but knowledge of discrete roles for this enzyme in humans is limited. We investigated a patient hypothesized to have an inherited prostanoid biosynthesis deficiency due to his multiple, complicated small intestinal ulcers despite no use of cyclooxygenase inhibitors. Levels of thromboxane B2 and 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid produced by platelets and leukotriene B4 released from calcium ionophore-activated blood were markedly reduced, indicating defective enzymatic release of the arachidonic acid substrate for the corresponding cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenases. Platelet aggregation and degranulation induced by adenosine diphosphate or collagen were diminished but were normal in response to arachidonic acid. Two heterozygous single base pair mutations and a known SNP were found in the coding regions of the patient's cPLA2alpha genes (p.[Ser111Pro]+[Arg485His; Lys651Arg]). The total PLA2 activity in sonicated platelets was diminished, and the urinary metabolites of prostacyclin, prostaglandin E2, prostaglandin D2, and thromboxane A2 were also reduced. These findings characterize what we believe is a novel inherited deficiency of cPLA2.\n",
      "Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD) pathophysiology remains largely unknown. Its treatment is not codified and usually disappointing. Interferon (IFN)-Œ± therapy lacks efficacy for some life-threatening manifestations and has a poor tolerance profile. Because interleukin (IL)-1Ra synthesis is naturally induced after stimulation by IFN-Œ±, we hypothesized that recombinant IL-1Ra (anakinra) might have some efficacy in ECD. We treated 2 patients who had poor tolerance or contraindication to IFN-Œ± with anakinra as a rescue therapy and measured their serum C-reactive protein, IL-1Œ≤, IL-6, and monocytic membranous IL-1Œ± (mIL-1Œ±) levels before, under, and after therapy. Another untreated ECD patient and 5 healthy subjects were enrolled as controls. After treatment, fever and bone pains rapidly disappeared in both patients, as well as eyelid involvement in one patient. In addition, retroperitoneal fibrosis completely or partially regressed, and C-reactive protein, IL-6, and mIL-1Œ± levels decreased to within the normal and control range. Beside injection-site reactions, no adverse event was reported. Therefore, our results support a central role of the IL-1 network, which seemed to be overstimulated in ECD. Its specific blockade using anakinra thereby opens new pathophysiology and therapeutic perspectives in ECD.\n",
      "We describe a patient homozygous for a novel mutation in COG7, coding for one of the subunits of the Conserved Oligomeric Golgi complex, involved in retrograde vesicular trafficking. His brother showed a similar clinical syndrome and glycosylation defect but no DNA could be obtained from this patient. This mutation, c.170-7A > G, activates a cryptic splice acceptor and leads to the insertion of 2 amino acids at protein level (p.56-57insAT). The insertion disturbs the structure and function of the Conserved Oligomeric Golgi complex. In comparison to the previously described patients with a different COG7 mutation, intrauterine growth retardation and dysmorphic features were absent and there was a longer survival.\n",
      "Two Jewish Ashkenazi male sibs are reported as having a new syndrome consisting of a white forelock, distinct facial features associated with congenital malformations involving the eye, cardio-pulmonary and skeletal systems. It is postulated that the etiology of this disorder is genetic and transmitted either as an autosomal recessive or X-linked recessive conditions.\n",
      "We describe a new early-onset neuromuscular disorder due to a homozygous loss-of-function variant in the kyphoscoliosis peptidase gene (KY). A 7.5-year-old girl with walking difficulties from 2 years of age presented with generalized muscle weakness; mild contractures in the shoulders, hips and feet; cavus feet; and lordosis but no scoliosis. She had previously been operated with Achilles tendon elongation. Whole-body MRI showed atrophy and fatty infiltration in the calf muscles. Biopsy of the vastus lateralis muscle showed variability in fiber size, with some internalized nuclei and numerous very small fibers with variable expression of developmental myosin heavy chain isoforms. Some small fibers showed abnormal sarcomeres with thickened Z-discs and small nemaline rods. Whole-exome sequencing revealed a homozygous one-base deletion (c.1071delG, p.(Thr358Leufs*3)) in KY, predicted to result in a truncated protein. Analysis of an RNA panel showed that KY is predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle in humans. A recessive variant in the murine ortholog Ky was previously described in a spontaneously generated mouse mutant with kyphoscoliosis, which developed postnatally and was caused by dystrophy of postural muscles. The abnormal distribution of Xin and Ky-binding partner filamin C in the muscle fibers of our patient was highly similar to their altered localization in ky/ky mouse muscle fibers. We describe the first human case of disease associated with KY inactivation. As in the mouse model, the affected child showed a neuromuscular disorder - but in contrast, no kyphoscoliosis.\n",
      "We have evaluated an infant with a striking combination of craniofacial anomalies, arachnodactyly, and severe developmental failure. She died at the age of 5 months during a recurrent apneic episode. She also had protruding eyes, downward slant of palpebral fissures, short upturned nose, midface hypoplasia, micrognathia, extreme under-development of the epiglottis, and severe feeding difficulties. The patient closely resembled four other previously reported patients. It is suggested that these five patients represent the same malformation syndrome, a well-recognizable separate entity. Our patient also had a pericentric inversion of chromosome 10; a possible association of this with the phenotype cannot be excluded.\n",
      "Gomez-Lopez-Hern√°ndez syndrome (GLHS) is a rare neurocutaneous syndrome characterized by a triad of findings: partial alopecia of the scalp, trigeminal anaesthesia, and rhombencephalosynapsis. GLHS is also known as cerebello-trigeminal-dermal dysplasia. Besides this triad, a number of varying traits have been described in 35 previously reported cases. Reported here is a case of a four-year-old boy, born out of consanguineous marriage, presenting with the classic triad of findings, i.e. partial alopecia of the scalp, trigeminal anaesthesia, and rhombencephalosynapsis. To the extent known, this is the first case of GLHS reported from India. If a child presents with alopecia and rhom-bencephalosynapsis, GLHS should be considered in the differential diagnosis. A host of studies can be used to determine the exact pathogenesis, and confirming the diagnosis of GLHS is an important step in prenatal testing for at-risk pregnancies.\n",
      "Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL) is a genetically heterogeneous group of lysosomal diseases that collectively compose the most common Mendelian form of childhood-onset neurodegeneration. It is estimated that √¢ÀÜ¬º8% of individuals diagnosed with NCL by conservative clinical and histopathologic criteria have been ruled out for mutations in the nine known NCL-associated genes, suggesting that additional genes remain unidentified. To further understand the genetic underpinnings of the NCLs, we performed whole-exome sequencing on DNA samples from a Mexican family affected by a molecularly undefined form of NCL characterized by infantile-onset progressive myoclonic epilepsy (PME), vision loss, cognitive and motor regression, premature death, and prominent NCL-type storage material. Using a recessive model to filter the identified variants, we found a single homozygous variant, c.550C>T in KCTD7, that causes a p.Arg184Cys missense change in potassium channel tetramerization domain-containing protein 7 (KCTD7) in the affected individuals. The mutation was predicted to be deleterious and was absent in over 6,000 controls. The identified variant altered the localization pattern of KCTD7 and abrogated interaction with cullin-3, a ubiquitin-ligase component and known KCTD7 interactor. Intriguingly, murine cerebellar cells derived from a juvenile NCL model (CLN3) showed enrichment of endogenous KCTD7. Whereas KCTD7 mutations have previously been linked to PME without lysosomal storage, this study clearly demonstrates that KCTD7 mutations also cause a rare, infantile-onset NCL subtype designated as CLN14.\n",
      "We report on a consanguineous Lebanese family in which a sister and brother had developmental delay, dysmorphic facial appearance, narrow chest, prominent abdomen, and short limbs. Neonatal radiographs disclosed a bell-shaped thorax, short ribs, some with a cupped end, severe platyspondyly, square iliac bones, horizontal acetabula with medial and lateral spurs, hypoplastic ischia, short long bones, slight widening of the distal femoral metaphyses, and absence of epiphyseal ossification of the knees. The girl died at age 9 months as a result of respiratory insufficiency. A clinical and radiological follow-up of the boy showed that the axial hypotonia, minor anomalies, and short stature were still present, whereas the bone abnormalities had improved. Differential diagnosis suggests that this is a new type of chondrodysplasia.\n",
      "We report on a family in which a mother and her 3 daughters have delayed psychomotor development and/or psychosis, hydrocephalus with white matter alterations, arachnoid cysts, skeletal anomalies consisting of brachydactyly, and Sprengel anomaly. Biochemical and cytogenetic analyses were normal on all 4 patients. The pattern of inheritance, clinical manifestations, and variability of expression suggest that this is a new hydrocephalus syndrome possibly transmitted as an X-linked dominant trait.\n",
      "AIMS:To estimate the prevalence of Usher syndrome in the city of Birmingham, and to establish a database of patients who have been classified into different clinical subtypes essential for future gene mutation analysis. METHODS:Symptomatic cases of Usher syndrome (US) resident in the city of Birmingham in June 1994 were ascertained through multiple sources. Ophthalmic and audiological reassessment together with examination of medical records and patient questionnaires allowed classification of three subtypes, US 1, US 2, and US 3. In addition, family pedigrees were examined and blood was taken from index patients for DNA extraction. RESULTS:In the population aged over 15 years the prevalence was 6.2 per 100 000 population for all US subtypes. The prevalence for US 1 and US 2 was 5.3 per 100 000 population. This is greater than previously reported. In the age group 30-49 years the prevalence approached 1 in 10 000. Clinical classification found 33% US 1, 47% US 2, and 20% US 3. CONCLUSION:This higher prevalence rate and greater frequency of US 2 and US 3 may reflect a more complete ascertainment.\n",
      "Collagenous gastritis (CG) is characterized by patchy subepithelial collagen bands. Effective treatment and the clinical and histological outcome of CG in children are poorly defined. The aim of this study is to summarize the published literature on the clinical outcome and response to therapy of pediatric CG including two new cases. We performed a search in Pubmed, OVID for related terms; articles including management and clinical and/or endo-histologic follow up information were included and abstracted. Reported findings were pooled in a dedicated database including the corresponding data extracted from chart review in our patients with CG. Twenty-four patients were included (17 females) with a mean age of 11.7 years. The clinical presentation included iron deficiency anemia and dyspepsia. The reported duration of follow up (in 18 patients) ranged between 0.2-14 years. Despite most subjects presenting with anemia including one requiring blood transfusion, oral iron therapy was only documented in 12 patients. Other treatment modalities were antisecretory measures in 13 patients; proton pump inhibitors (12), or histamine-2 blockers (3), sucralfate (5), prednisolone (6), oral budesonide in 3 patients where one received it in fish oil and triple therapy (3). Three (13%) patients showed no clinical improvement despite therapy; conversely 19 out of 22 were reported with improved symptoms including 8 with complete symptom resolution. Spontaneous clinical resolution without antisecretory, anti-inflammatory or gastroprotective agents was noted in 5 patients (4 received only supplemental iron). Follow up endo-histopathologic data (17 patients) included persistent collagen band and stable Mononuclear cell infiltrate in 12 patients with histopathologic improvement in 5 patients. Neither collagen band thickness nor mononuclear cell infiltrate correlated with clinical course. Intestinal metaplasia and endocrine cell hyperplasia were reported (1) raising the concern of long term malignant transformation. In summary, CG in children is a chronic disease, typically with a variable clinical response and an indolent course that is distinct from the adult phenotype. Long term therapy usually included iron supplementation but cannot be standardized, given the chronicity of the disease, variability of response and potential for adverse events.\n",
      "Autosomal dominant optic atrophy (ADOA) is the most common inherited optic atrophy. Clinical features of ADOA include a slowly progressive bilateral loss of visual acuity, constriction of peripheral visual fields, central scotomas, and color vision abnormalities. Although ADOA is the most commonly inherited optic atrophy, autosomal recessive, X-linked, mitochondrial, and sporadic forms have also been reported. Four families with X-linked optic atrophy (XLOA) were previously described. One family was subsequently linked to Xp11.4-Xp11.2 (OPA2). This investigation studied one multi-generation family with an apparently X-linked form of optic atrophy and compared their clinical characteristics with those of the previously described families, and determined whether this family was linked to the same genetic locus. Fifteen individuals in a three-generation Idaho family underwent complete eye examination, color vision testing, automated perimetry, and fundus photography. Polymorphic markers were used to genotype each individual and to determine linkage. Visual acuities ranged from 20/30 to 20/100. All affected subjects had significant optic nerve pallor. Obligate female carriers were clinically unaffected. Preliminary linkage analysis (LOD score = 1.8) revealed that the disease gene localized to the OPA2 locus on Xp11.4-Xp11.2. Four forms of inherited optic neuropathy, ADOA, autosomal recessive optic atrophy (Costeff Syndrome), Leber hereditary optic neuropathy, and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease with optic atrophy, are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. Future identification of the XLOA gene will reveal whether this form of optic atrophy is also associated with a mitochondrial defect. Identification of the XLOA gene will advance our understanding of the inherited optic neuropathies and perhaps suggest treatments for these diseases. An improved understanding of inherited optic neuropathies may in turn advance our understanding of acquired optic nerve diseases, such as glaucoma and ischemic optic neuropathy.\n",
      "MRXS5 or Pettigrew syndrome was described 20 years ago in a four generation family including nine affected individuals presenting with facial dysmorphism, intellectual disability, Dandy-Walker malformation and inconstant choreoathetosis. Four individuals had iron deposition in the basal ganglia seen on MRI or at autopsy. The mutation causing Pettigrew has remained elusive since the initial description of the condition. We report the identification of a mutation in the X-linked AP1S2 gene in the original Pettigrew syndrome family using X-chromosome exome sequencing. We report additional phenotype details for several of the affected individuals, allowing us to further refine the phenotype corresponding to this X-linked intellectual disability syndrome. The AP1S2 c.426+1‚ÄâG>T mutation segregates with the disease in the Pettigrew syndrome family and results in loss of 46 amino acids in the clathrin adaptor complex small chain domain that spans most of the AP1S2 protein sequence. The mutation reported here in AP1S2 is the first mutation that is not predicted to cause a premature termination of the coding sequence or absence of the AP1S2 protein. Although most of the families affected by a mutation in AP1S2 were initially described as having different disorders assigned to at least three different OMIM numbers (MIM 300629, 300630 and 304340), our analysis of the phenotype shows that they are all the same syndrome with recognition complicated by highly variable expressivity that is seen within as well as between families and is probably not explained by differences in mutation severity.\n",
      "Bruck syndrome (BS) is an extremely rare form of osteogenesis imperfecta characterized by congenital joint contracture, multiple fractures and short stature. We described the phenotypes of BS in two Chinese patients for the first time. The novel compound heterozygous mutations c.764_772dupACGTCCTCC (p.255_257dupHisValLeu) in exon 5 and c.1405G>T (p.Gly469X) in exon 9 of FKBP10 were identified in one proband. The novel compound heterozygous mutations c.1624delT (p.Tyr542Thrfs*18) in exon 14 and c.1880T>C (p.Val627Ala) in exon 17 of PLOD2 were identified in another probrand. Intravenous zoledronate was a potent agent for these patients, confirmed the efficacy of bisphosphonates on this disease. In conclusion, the novel causative mutations identified in the patients expand the genotypic spectrum of BS.\n",
      "We present a family with a radiologically distinct new form of autosomal dominant spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, presenting with cervical instability and attendant neurological compromise and emphasise the radiological characteristics which delineate this condition. Cervical vertebral abnormalities, including malformation of the odontoid process, have been observed in some forms of spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, but rarely lead to neurological sequelae, in contrast to the pedigree we describe.\n",
      "Cap myopathy is a rare congenital myopathy characterized by cap structures located at the periphery of the muscle fiber. Cap structures consist of disarranged thin filaments with enlarged Z discs. The clinical presentation and natural history of cap myopathy is variable and overlaps with other congenital myopathies.We describe a 10-year-old boy with cap myopathy and contrast him with 20 other individuals reported in the literature.Our patient presented at birth with hypotonia and weakness and subsequently developed respiratory failure in infancy. He is ambulatory but has increasing fatigue and requires a wheelchair by midafternoon. His muscle biopsy at 3 months revealed a nemaline myopathy and secondary fiber-type disproportion with type 1 hypotrophy and predominance. A repeat muscle biopsy at age 6 years revealed numerous peripherally located cap-like structures containing nemaline rods and exhibited a spectrum of Z-disk and myofibrillar abnormalities. Molecular genetic testing was performed for NEB, TPM2, TPM3, ACTA1, TNNT1, SEPN1, SMN1, DMPK, FSHMD1A, and mtDNA. A known pathogenic mutation, c.1152+1G>A, and a previously unreported variant, c.1782+4_1782+5delAG, were detected in NEB.Our patient has a more severe phenotype than most reported patients and is the first patient with cap myopathy to have a mutation in NEB. Our case supports the identification of cap myopathy as a congenital myopathy with significant overlapping features with nemaline myopathies and further elucidates the phenotype of this disease.\n",
      "Hyponatraemia with hyperkalaemia in infancy is a typical presentation of congenital adrenal hyperplasia. In the presence of pyelonephritis, the same biochemical picture can occur with transient type 1 pseudohypoaldosteronism (PHA-1) also termed type 4 renal tubular acidosis. Recognition of PHA-1 enables appropriate management thus avoiding unnecessary investigations and treatment. To improve awareness of this condition, we present a case series to highlight the clinical and biochemical features of PHA-1.A retrospective chart review of patients diagnosed with transient PHA-1 at a tertiary children's hospital in Western Australia was conducted.Five male infants (32√¢‚Ç¨‚Ä∞days to 6 months) with transient PHA-1 were identified. Failure to thrive was the most common symptom with hyponatraemia on presentation. Two infants had antenatally diagnosed bilateral hydronephrosis and urinary tract infection (UTI) on admission. Two infants were treated for congenital adrenal hyperplasia and received hydrocortisone. All infants had UTI and required parenteral antibiotics. The condition was transient and hyponatraemia corrected by day 4 in all infants. There was no correlation between plasma sodium and aldosterone levels. The severity of PHA-1 was independent of the underlying renal anomaly. Four infants had hydronephrosis and vesicoureteric reflux. Surgical intervention was required in two infants.PHA-1 may be precipitated by UTI or urinary tract anomalies in early infancy. Urine analysis should be performed in infants with hyponatraemia. Diagnosis of PHA-1 facilitates appropriate renal investigations to reduce long-term morbidity.\n",
      "Calcifications of the basal ganglia are described under the heading of \"Fahr's syndrome\". The clinical pattern is variable and the syndrome may be sporadic or familial. This study describes a personal series of 14 cases of encephalopathy with calcification of the basal ganglia and reviews the literature cases. A four-group classification is proposed. The first group includes encephalopathy, microcephaly, dwarfism, retinal degeneration or optic atrophy, symmetrical patchy demyelination with calcifications and probable autosomal recessive inheritance. Some cases have an early onset, a rapid evolution. Others have a later onset, longer course and retinal degeneration. In the second group, the children suffer from a congenital encephalopathy or a cerebral palsy without clear deterioration, without short stature, ocular impairment or persistent CSF abnormalities. This group has not been reported in the literature. The cases do not seem to be genetic. The precise cause in unknown but a sporadic non progressive anoxo-ischemic, or viral prenatal disease is suggested. In the third group, the association of encephalopathy, microcephaly, and persistent CSF lymphocytosis, has a high recurrence rate. The pathogenesis is still a matter of dispute. The fourth group is characterized by autosomal dominant calcifications of the basal ganglia with or without neurological abnormalities. Finally calcium metabolism disorders and mitochondrial encephalomyopathy may be associated with calcifications of the basal ganglia.\n",
      "Craniosynostosis, caused by early fusion of one or more cranial sutures, can affect the coronal or lambdoid sutures, or include premature fusion of the sagittal (scaphocephaly) or metopic suture (trigonocephaly). Often occurring as isolated finding, their co-existence in a craniosynostosis syndrome is infrequent. We describe a four-generation family with variable expression of a craniosynostosis phenotype with scaphocephaly and a particularly severe trigonocephaly. Molecular analysis revealed a missense mutation in the MSX2-associated with the Boston-type craniosynostosis syndrome-affecting the same amino-acid residue as in the original Boston family. Besides unique features such as the cranial sutures involved, minor limb abnormalities and incomplete penetrance, our patients share with the original family autosomal dominant inheritance and the presence of multiple endocranial erosions on CT imaging. Though these findings appear to be important diagnostic clues for MSX2-related craniosynostosis, it is noteworthy that the first affected generation in this family presented merely with isolated sagittal or unicoronal craniosynostosis and cutaneous syndactyly. Molecular analysis of MSX2 should therefore be considered in patients with isolated scaphocephaly/unicoronal synostosis, especially in the presence of a family history for craniosynostosis or syndactyly.\n",
      "An identical pattern of malformations was found in two brothers both having microcephaly and severe developmental delay. Additionally, they had hypotelorism, epicanthic folds, and convergent strabismus. There was shortening of either the radius or the tibia and shortening of the first metacarpals. Persistently dorsally flexed fingers and toes were noted, all of which are unusually long. Both boys had a high-pitched voice and were unable to communicate verbally at the age of 4.5 years. They both developed short stature. One brother has anal atresia; the other had a pulmonary artery atresia, VSD, ASD, and an over-riding aorta. This apparently new syndrome is possibly an autosomal, or a X-linked recessive trait.\n",
      "A Caucasian family was verified to have 11 affected persons (7 women and 4 men) in four generations. A mild and variable clinical picture (dry, thin skin, dental involvement, and nail alteration) was verified in all the affected, with the exception of the propositus who has a more severe clinical picture, besides also having trichodysplasia. The segregation ratio (11 normal: 10 affected) verified in the offspring of the affected and other criteria permit the hypothesis of an autosomal dominant gene. This pure dysplasia was compared to 27 other conditions belonging to the tricho-odonto-onychial subgroup and proved to be different from all the others.\n",
      "The clinical and radiological features are described in male and female siblings with a unique form of spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia. In addition to generalized platyspondyly with epiphyseal and metaphyseal involvement, these children also have thin tapering fingers with accentuated palmar creases and abnormal dentition with oligodontia and pointed incisors. Parental consanguinity suggests that this is an autosomal recessive disorder.\n",
      "Steinfeld syndrome, which was first reported in 1982, is characterized by holoprosencephaly, phocomelia, clefting, congenital heart defects, and other anomalies. There have been two additional reports since then. This report describes a fetus with clinical features consistent with Steinfeld syndrome and it is the first patient with this condition to have extensive genetic evaluation. This appears to be an autosomal dominant syndrome with widely variable expression. The clinical features of this syndrome are reviewed.\n",
      "Aromatase deficiency (AD) is a very rare disorder resulting from mutations in the CYP19A1 gene encoding aromatase, a cytochrome P450 enzyme that plays a pivotal role in androgen conversion to estrogens. AD is inherited in an autosomal recessive trait, and to date only 35 cases have been described in the literature. Herein, we depict a new patient reared as a male, who presented at the age of 21 years with no palpable testis, hypoplastic scrotum, penis-like phallus (3 cm), and penoscrotal hypospadias. The patient was born to consanguineous parents, his karyotype was 46,XX, and SRY was negative. Pelvic sonar showed a small hypoplastic uterus, and no testis could be identified. Serum testosterone was within the reference range of females along with high gonadotropins. Pathology of gonadal biopsy showed ovarian stroma negative for oocytic follicle consistent with streak gonads. All these data were suggestive of AD, which was subsequently confirmed by molecular investigation of the CYP19A1 gene. A homozygous splice site mutation in the donor splice site of exon 9 was identified, c.1263 + 1G>T. This is the first report of such a rare disorder in an Egyptian patient. Our results reinforce the importance of considering AD in patients with 46,XX disorders of sex development after ruling out congenital adrenal hyperplasia.\n",
      "A clinical, genetic and epidemiological study of hereditary ataxias and paraplegias was conducted within a defined area (Cantabria) in Northern Spain from 1974 to 1986. The series comprised 48 index cases and 65 affected relatives. On prevalence day, 103 patients were alive, giving a prevalence of 20.2 cases per 100,000. There were 24 patients (18 families) with Friedreich's ataxia (FA), 12 (6 families) with early onset cerebellar ataxia (EOCA) differing from FA, 6 (3 families) with dominantly transmitted late onset cerebellar ataxia (LOCA), 11 with 'idiopathic' LOCA, 49 (9 families) with 'pure' hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), and 1 patient with congenital cerebellar ataxia. The prevalence found here is comparable with the highest figures described in previous surveys. This may in part be due to the great number of secondary cases in our series. A high frequency of parental consanguinity occurred in FA patients, 'pseudodominant' inheritance being observed in 1 family. The clinical features were those of classical FA except for later onset and slower course in 1 family, and retained tendon reflexes in the lower limbs in 2 cases. Such data indicate the need for modification of the essential criteria for the disease. EOCA included 4 patients with normoreflexic ataxia and 1 patient with ataxia and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone deficiency. In addition, there were 7 patients from 2 unrelated families with a homogeneous syndrome characterized by autosomal recessive inheritance, cerebellar ataxia, retinitis pigmentosa and sensory neuropathy. This syndrome is therefore a well defined nosological entity to be added to the list of autosomal recessive mendelian phenotypes. The clinical picture of patients with LOCA was either a 'pure' cerebellar or a 'cerebellar-plus' syndrome. Genetic subgroups of 'pure' HSP were autosomal dominant type I in 5 families and type II in 2, and autosomal recessive in 2 families.\n",
      "UNLABELLED: We report a Spanish family affected from a late onset, hand-involved and autosomal dominant distal myopathy associated to Caveolin-3 mutation. Signs of muscle hyperexcitability and hyperckemia were observed in the youngest relatives but not motor symptoms. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Neurological examination was performed in all members of the family. Muscle biopsy sample was taken from the proband and DNA genomics was amplified for the two exons of Cav-3 by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in all the affected members and in three asymptomatic relatives. RESULTS: Signs of muscle hyperexcitability and hyperckemia were observed in the affected members from early ages. Cav-3 expression was greatly reduced in the sarcolemma of the proband's muscle. Genetic studies revealed a G --> A transition at nucleotide position 80 in exon 1 of the Cav-3 gene (c.80G>A), generating a Arg --> Gln change at codon 27 (p.R27Q) of the amino acid chain in heterozygous state, while no mutation was found in unaffected members. CONCLUSIONS: Signs of muscle hyperexcitability and hyperckemia at early ages may predict the development of a late onset autosomal dominant hand-involved myopathy associated to Cav-3 mutation in the family reported herein.\n",
      "We present a family segregating for an autosomal dominant syndrome of hypotelorism, cleft palate/uvula, high-arched palate and mild mental retardation. Although these findings may suggest a form of holoprosencephaly, no holoprosencephaly was found on MRI of the proposita. Results of genetic studies were normal including FISH for deletion of 22q11, karyotype analysis, fragile X testing, high-resolution comparative genomic hybridization and SEPT9, SHH mutation analysis. The syndrome is reminiscent of the infrequently recognized autosomal dominant Schilbach-Rott syndrome.\n",
      "Three unrelated children are reported with intrauterine proportionate growth retardation and facial dysmorphism (broad nose, flat malar area, large mouth, pointed chin), microcephaly, hypo/aplasia of the terminal fifth digits, and (sub)normal intelligence. Radiological findings include hypo/aplasia or fusion of the distal phalanges of the fifth finger and toe, brachymesophalangism V, and nail dysplasia or aplasia. One child had cystic adenomatoid disease of the lung. The pattern of anomalies presented by these children closely resembles a syndrome incompletely delineated in 1971 by Senior in six children, which has often been considered to be a mild form of Coffin-Siris syndrome. We suggest that this is an independent entity (BOD syndrome). The aetiology is still unknown. Differential diagnosis and nosological difficulties are discussed.\n",
      "Heterozygous germline mutations in MTOR have been shown to underlie Smith-Kingsmore syndrome, a rare autosomal dominant syndrome characterized by macrocephaly, developmental delay, and dysmorphic facial features. Recently, two unrelated families with the MTOR mutation, c.5395G>A p.(Glu1799Lys), were reported. Here, we describe siblings from a non-consanguineous German family in whom we identified the same heterozygous missense mutation in MTOR. Remarkably, in all reported families with Smith-Kingsmore syndrome and the MTOR c.5395G>A mutation, including the family described herein, healthy parents of recurrently affected children do not have detectable levels of the mutation in tested tissues, lending credence to gonadal mosaicism as the underlying mechanism. Furthermore, the glutamic acid at position 1799 was shown to present a recurrent somatic mutation site in several cancers, including colon cancer, pointing to a somatic mutational hotspot in MTOR. Importantly, we highlight the occurrence of multiple intestinal polyps in the older sibling. Further patients are required to establish definitively whether polyp formation forms part of the SKS clinical spectrum. ¬© 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\n",
      "We present a dysmorphic syndrome in eight males of the same family (four brothers, three cousins and one uncle) that is characterised by: mental retardation, facial dysmorphia, abnormal growth of teeth, skin dimple at the lower back, clinodactyly, patella luxation, malformation of lower limbs, abnormalities of the fundus of the eye and subcortical cerebral atrophy. These physical defects do not correspond to any previously described syndrome, which suggests that it is a new syndrome. According to the model of heredity this syndrome could be due to a mutant gene situated in the X-chromosome.\n",
      "We report a sister and brother born to consanguineous parents presenting with severe hypodontia, fine hair, and onychodysplasia. Five other relatives are similarly affected. The comparison with other ectodermal dysplasias is presented and discussed. The possibility of a new autosomal recessive form of ectodermal dysplasia is raised.\n",
      "A \"new\" syndrome was identified by McPherson and Clemens [1996: Am J Med Genet 62:58-60] in a brother and sister with bilateral cleft lip and palate, hypertelorism, flat facial profile, flat occiput, and complex heart defects. The brother also had a bilobed tongue and the sister had malrotation of the intestine and bifid thumbs. We describe three brothers with similar anomalies apart from the bilobed tongue, malrotation of the intestine, and bifid thumbs. McPherson and Clemens [1996: Am J Med Genet 62:58-60] suggested autosomal recessive inheritance. Our observation of three affected brothers also raises the possibility of X-linked recessive inheritance.\n",
      "Background Combined immunodeficiencies are marked by inborn errors of T-cell immunity in which the T cells that are present are quantitatively or functionally deficient. Impaired humoral immunity is also common. Patients have severe infections, autoimmunity, or both. The specific molecular, cellular, and clinical features of many types of combined immunodeficiencies remain unknown. Methods We performed genetic and cellular immunologic studies involving five unrelated children with early-onset invasive bacterial and viral infections, lymphopenia, and defective T-cell, B-cell, and natural killer (NK)-cell responses. Two patients died early in childhood; after allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation, the other three had normalization of T-cell function and clinical improvement. Results We identified biallelic mutations in the dedicator of cytokinesis 2 gene (DOCK2) in these five patients. RAC1 activation was impaired in the T cells. Chemokine-induced migration and actin polymerization were defective in the T cells, B cells, and NK cells. NK-cell degranulation was also affected. Interferon-Œ± and interferon-Œª production by peripheral-blood mononuclear cells was diminished after viral infection. Moreover, in DOCK2-deficient fibroblasts, viral replication was increased and virus-induced cell death was enhanced; these conditions were normalized by treatment with interferon alfa-2b or after expression of wild-type DOCK2. Conclusions Autosomal recessive DOCK2 deficiency is a new mendelian disorder with pleiotropic defects of hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic immunity. Children with clinical features of combined immunodeficiencies, especially with early-onset, invasive infections, may have this condition.

      "Mutations in the RFX6 gene were recently described to underlie a distinct autosomal recessive syndrome of neonatal diabetes comprising intestinal atresia and hepatobiliary abnormalities. Until now, only six patients harboring RFX6 mutations have been reported. We report on a new case due to a novel homozygous splice site mutation and update on the clinical outcome of a previously reported patient. In addition we review the clinical and molecular features of all RFX6 mutated cases to better characterize the syndrome. Our results suggest that despite the early postnatal fulminant course, patients who survive may expect a relatively favorable prognosis.\n",
      "Congenital tracheo-or-bronchobiliary fistula is a rare anomaly. Here, we present a malnourished child with persistent and recurrent respiratory symptoms. Flexible bronchoscopy and imaging studies were carried out to ascertain the diagnosis, anatomy and associated anomalies prior to surgery. Patient underwent successful corrective surgery with complete resolution of symptoms.\n",
      "We report on syringomyelia of the thoracic spinal cord in two sisters without a Chiari or any other malformation. In both cases syringomyelia was determined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Spinal MRI showed a syringomyelia between T6-T8 levels in the first sibling and between T7- T9 in the second sibling. The cranio-cervical junction was normal and tonsiller ectopia was not present. Neurological examination of both sisters was normal. They did not undergo surgery as they had mild symptoms without neurological deficit and the size of the syrinx was small. Familial syringomyelia is a very rare finding and extremely rare at only the thoracic level. Genetic and environmental factors seem to be involved in familial syringomyelia.\n",
      "Hypomyelinating disorders of the central nervous system are still a diagnostic challenge, as many patients remain without genetic diagnosis. Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) pattern recognition and whole exome sequencing, we could ascertain compound heterozygous mutations in RARS in 4 patients with hypomyelination. Clinical features included severe spasticity and nystagmus. RARS encodes the cytoplasmic arginyl-tRNA synthetase, an enzyme essential for RNA translation. This protein is among the subunits of the multisynthetase complex, which emerges as a key player in myelination.\n",
      "The Adams-Oliver syndrome (AOS) is defined as aplasia cutis congenita (ACC) with transverse terminal limb defects (TTLD). Frequencies of associated anomalies are not well characterized. Six causative genes have been identified: ARHGAP31, DOCK6, EOGT, RBPJ, NOTCH1, and DLL4. We review 385 previously described individuals (139 non-familial and 246 familial probands and family members) and add clinical data on 13 previously unreported individuals with AOS. In addition to ACC and TTLD, the most commonly associated anomalies included a wide variety of central nervous system (CNS) anomalies and congenital heart defects each seen in 23%. CNS anomalies included structural anomalies, microcephaly, vascular defects, and vascular sequelae. CNS migration defects were common. Cutis marmorata telangiectasia congenita (CMTC) was found in 19% of the study population and other vascular anomalies were seen in 14%. Hemorrhage was listed as the cause of death for five of 25 deaths reported. A relatively large number of non-familial probands were reported to have hepatoportal sclerosis with portal hypertension and esophageal varices. Non-familial probands were more likely to have additional anomalies than were familial probands. The data reported herein provide a basis for refining the diagnostic features of AOS and suggest management recommendations for probands newly diagnosed with AOS. √Ç¬© 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\n",
      "Mutations in FARS2 are known to cause dysfunction of mitochondrial translation due to deficient aminoacylation of the mitochondrial phenylalanine tRNA. Here, we report three novel mutations in FARS2 found in two patients in a compound heterozygous state. The missense mutation c.1082C>T (p.Pro361Leu) was detected in both patients. The mutations c.461C>T (p.Ala154Val) and c.521_523delTGG (p.Val174del) were each detected in one patient. We report abnormal in vitro aminoacylation assays as a functional validation of the molecular genetic findings. Based on the phenotypic data of previously reported subjects and the two subjects reported here, we conclude that FARS2 deficiency can be associated with two phenotypes: (i) an epileptic phenotype, and (ii) a spastic paraplegia phenotype.\n",
      "Cryptogenic multifocal ulcerating stenosing enteritis (CMUSE) is an extremely rare, but devastating, disease of unknown aetiology. We investigated the genetic basis of this autosomal recessive condition in a pair of affected siblings who have 40-year histories of catastrophic gastrointestinal and extraintestinal disease.Genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism homozygosity mapping in the two affected family members combined with whole-exome sequencing of one affected sibling. This was followed by confirmatory Sanger sequencing of the likely disease-causing sequence variant and functional studies in affected and unaffected family members.Insertion/deletion variation analysis revealed the presence of a homozygous 4 bp deletion (g.155574_77delGTAA) in the PLA2G4A gene, located in the splice donor site directly after exon 17 (the penultimate exon) of the gene in both affected siblings. This introduces a frameshift of 10 amino acids before a premature stop codon (p.V707fsX10), which is predicted to result in the loss of 43 amino acids (residues 707-749) at the C-terminus of cytosolic phospholipase A2-Œ± (cPLA(2)Œ±). cPLA(2)Œ± protein expression was undetectable in the gut of both siblings, with platelet aggregation and thromboxane A(2) production, as functional assays for cPLA(2)Œ± activity, grossly impaired.We have identified mutations in PLA2G4A as a cause of CMUSE in two affected siblings. Further studies are needed to determine if mutations in this gene are also responsible for disease of a similar phenotype in other cases.\n",

      "Mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis (mtFAS) is an evolutionarily conserved pathway essential for the function of the respiratory chain and several mitochondrial enzyme complexes. We report here a unique neurometabolic human disorder caused by defective mtFAS. Seven individuals from five unrelated families presented with childhood-onset dystonia, optic atrophy, and basal ganglia signal abnormalities on MRI. All affected individuals were found to harbor recessive mutations in MECR encoding the mitochondrial trans-2-enoyl-coenzyme A-reductase involved in human mtFAS. All six mutations are extremely rare in the general population, segregate with the disease in the families, and are predicted to be deleterious. The nonsense c.855T>G (p.Tyr285‚àó), c.247_250del (p.Asn83Hisfs‚àó4), and splice site c.830+2_830+3insT mutations lead to C-terminal truncation variants of MECR. The missense c.695G>A (p.Gly232Glu), c.854A>G (p.Tyr285Cys), and c.772C>T (p.Arg258Trp) mutations involve conserved amino acid residues, are located within the cofactor binding domain, and are predicted by structural analysis to have a destabilizing effect. Yeast modeling and complementation studies validated the pathogenicity of the MECR mutations. Fibroblast cell lines from affected individuals displayed reduced levels of both MECR and lipoylated proteins as well as defective respiration. These results suggest that mutations in MECR cause a distinct human disorder of the mtFAS pathway. The observation of decreased lipoylation raises the possibility of a potential therapeutic strategy.\n",
      "Recurrent encephalopathy affecting cerebellar and extrapyramidal structures was observed in five members of two families. The syndrome is characterized by sudden onset of truncal ataxia, occasionally accompanied by lethargy and impairment of speech. Choreic and athetoid movements were present, and there was loss of deep tendon reflexes with presence of pathological reflexes. Onset of the disease was early in childhood. Attacks lasted for days to weeks; residual symptoms comprising speech impairment and incoordination were seen in some patients. Both sexes were affected. The pedigrees suggest autosomal dominant inheritance. Pathogenesis remains unexplained by the laboratory studies done; metabolic or immunological processes predisposed by genetic factors are suggested. Similar reports from the literature are discussed; no identical family could be found.\n",
      "Acro-dermato-ungual-lacrimal-tooth (ADULT) syndrome is a rare form of autosomal dominant ectodermal dysplasia due to mutations in the TP63 gene, a locus that has also been implicated in other syndromic forms of ectodermal dysplasia. It shares many phenotypic characteristics with other TP63 gene mutation syndromes, often making an accurate diagnosis difficult. Long-term management and follow-up of the various sequelae of ectodermal dysplasia require an accurate diagnosis. We report a familial case of ADULT syndrome in a daughter, mother, and son and provide a brief review of the clinical characteristics of this syndrome.\n",
      "We describe two sisters with a PEHO-like syndrome. The first-born had early epileptic spasms with hypsarrhythmia, visual inattention with optic atrophy, progressive microcephaly and absence of development. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging revealed periventricular white matter changes. Cerebellar hypoplasia, characteristic of true PEHO syndrome, was absent. The MRI changes were interpreted as periventricular leucomalacia due to prenatal ischaemia, and a low recurrence risk was suggested. Subsequently, the younger sister was born similarly affected. The PEHO syndrome (progressive encephalopathy, hypsarrhythmia and optic atrophy) is a rare, autosomal recessive, encephalopathy of infancy. Diagnosis is clinical but cerebellar hypoplasia on neuroimaging is regarded as an additional necessary criterion. A heterogeneous group of PEHO-like patients, who lack cerebellar hypoplasia but have varying supratentorial abnormalities, have been reported. This is the second report of siblings with a PEHO-like syndrome, and supports the existence of a distinct, autosomal recessive condition in which neuroimaging abnormalities may be misinterpreted.\n",
      "Cleft lip and palate are the most common congenital craniofacial anomaly in humans. The presence of oral synechia along with cleft palate is a rare syndrome. We encountered one case that had a cleft palate accompanied by congenital oral synechia due to a membranous adhesion between the floor of the mouth and the free margin of the cleft palate.\n",
      "Pediatric cases of Spigelian hernias are rare. Only a few reports on this condition, in combination with ipsilateral cryptorchidism and testis in the hernia sac, have been published. We report on Spigelian hernia in a 3-week-old boy containing both the ipsilateral testis, without a gubernaculum and an incarcerated loop of the small intestine. It has been suggested that the combination of Spigelian hernia and ipsilateral cryptorchidism is part of a new syndrome. We discuss whether the lack of a gubernaculum and an inguinal canal reported in other similar cases may be additional elements of this new syndrome. We present a comprehensive overview of pediatric patients with Spigelian-cryptorchidism syndrome reported in the English language literature. In 75% of male infants with Spigelian hernia, there is an associated ipsilateral cryptorchidism, and in 87% of these patients, the testis is found inside the hernia sac. Thus, the surgeon dealing with a congenital Spigelian hernia should look for an undescended testis and be prepared to find it in the hernia sac.\n",
      "This paper reports on a 36-year-old woman with GAPO syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive condition characterized by growth retardation (G), alopecia (A), pseudoanodontia (P), and optic atrophy (O). Her parents are consanguineous and one of her sisters is also affected. Since the first description by Anderson and Pindborg in 1947, 27 individuals have been reported with this diagnosis. They were from at least 19 different families (four of them from Brazil, including the present one), suggesting a founder effect. The phenotype of this condition, initially considered as the result of an ectodermal dysplasia, could be attributed to the accumulation of extracellular connective tissue matrix and its progressive character must be pointed out. The clinical findings, especially ophthalmological features that include bilateral glaucoma, are reviewed and discussed.\n",
      "The 5q31.3 microdeletion syndrome has recently emerged as a distinct clinical entity, and we report two new patients with de novo deletions of this region, bringing the total to seven. Similarly to previously reported cases, the phenotype of our patients is characterized by marked hypotonia, apnea, developmental delay, and feeding difficulties. Both patients had abnormal movements which did not correlate with epileptiform activity on electroencephalogram (EEG). Developmental brain changes on neuroimaging consisted of abnormalities predominantly affecting the white matter and frontal lobes. The 5q31.3 deleted regions overlap those of previously reported cases, and allow further refinement of the shortest region of overlap to 101√¢‚Ç¨‚Ä∞kb, including only three genes. Of these, the purine-rich element binding protein A (PURA) gene has an established role in brain development, and we propose that haploinsufficiency for this gene is primarily responsible for the neurodevelopmental features observed.\n",
      "Interstitial deletions of chromosome band 14q24.1q24.3 are apparently very rare. We report on three unrelated patients with overlapping de novo deletions of sizes 5.4, 2.8, and 2.3‚ÄâMb in this region. While some clinical problems such as intestinal malrotation, cryptorchidism, and ectopic kidney were only observed in single patients, all three patients had mild intellectual disability, congenital heart defects (truncus arteriosus, pulmonary atresia, atrial septal defect, and/or ventricular septal defect), brachydactyly, hypertelorism, broad nasal bridge, and thin upper lips. Likely haploinsufficiency of one or several of the 19 genes in the common deleted interval (ACTN1, DCAF5, EXD2, GALNTL1, ERH, SLC39A9, PLEKHD1, CCDC177, KIAA0247, LOC100289511, SRSF5, SLC10A1, SMOC1, SLC8A3, ADAM21P1, COX16, SYNJ2BP, SYNJ2BP-COX16, ADAM21) was responsible for these manifestations, but apart from SMOC1, mutations in which cause autosomal recessive Waardenburg anophthalmia syndrome, and ACTN1, mutations in which are associated with congenital macrothrombocytopenia, no disease associations have so far been reported for the other genes. Functional studies and a systematic search for mutations or chromosome aberrations in this region will elucidate the role of individual genes in the clinical manifestations and will provide insight into the underlying biological mechanisms.\n",
      "Leukocyte adhesion deficiency type II is a hereditary disorder of neutrophil migration caused by mutations in the guanosine diphosphate-fucose transporter gene (SLC35C1). In these patients, inability to generate key fucosylated molecules including sialyl Lewis X leads to leukocytosis and recurrent infections, in addition to short stature and developmental delay. We report two brothers with short stature and developmental delay who are compound heterozygotes for novel mutations in SLC35C1 resulting in partial in vivo defects in fucosylation. Specifically, plasma glycoproteins including immunoglobulin G demonstrated marked changes in glycoform distribution. While neutrophil rolling on endothelial selectins was partially impeded, residual adhesion proved sufficient to avoid leukocytosis or recurrent infection. These findings demonstrate a surprising degree of immune redundancy in the face of substantial alterations in adhesion molecule expression, and show that short stature and developmental delay may be the sole presenting signs in this disorder.\n",
      "We present a family in which five members over three generations have a syndrome characterized by camptodactyly, flattened bodies of cervical vertebrae, and a variable degree of thoracic scoliosis. After excluding other camptodactyly syndromes, it was concluded that this association of anomalies probably represents a new autosomal dominant syndrome.\n",

      "We describe a new case of Ermine phenotype. The patient had the striking pattern of skin and hair involvement that characterize the condition, global developmental delay, growth retardation, microcephaly, and bilateral hearing loss. Results of extensive workup for several other neurologic, metabolic, mitochondrial, genetic and chromosomal conditions were normal. Microscopic examination demonstrated normal numbers of melanocytes and variable amounts of pigment depending on the degree of pigmentation in the region biopsied. Ultrastructure of melanosomes was abnormal suggesting a defect in melanin synthesis. Ermine phenotype has a distinct clinical presentation compared to other syndromes associated with abnormal pigment and deafness. Therefore, this should be included as an independent condition in the differential diagnosis. Additional phenotypic and pathologic descriptions are needed to better define this condition clinically, pathologically, and genetically.\n",
      "In 1973, Jones and Smith described two maternal male first cousins with a similar pattern of malformation, including mental retardation, cubitus valgus, and unusual facies. The purpose of this report is to describe three additional cases, a 10-year-old male and his 30-year-old maternal uncle and an unrelated 15-year-old boy, bringing to five the total number of individuals with this disorder. The principal features include moderate mental retardation, mild microcephaly, a short philtrum, deep-set, downslanting palpebral fissures, multiple nevi, and striking cubitus valgus. Documentation of this disorder in two maternal male first cousins as well as in a male and his maternal uncle support an X-linked recessive mode of inheritance for this condition.\n",
      "The ADULT syndrome (Acro-Dermato-Ungual-Lacrimal-Tooth, OMIM 103285) is a rare ectodermal dysplasia associated with limb malformations and caused by heterozygous mutations in p63. ADULT syndrome has clinical overlap with other p63 mutation syndromes, such as EEC (OMIM 604292), LMS (OMIM 603543), AEC (106260), RHS (129400) and SHFM4 (605289). ADULT syndrome characteristics are ectrodactyly, ectodermal dysplasia, mammary gland hypoplasia and normal lip and palate. The latter findings allow differentiation from EEC syndrome. LMS differs by milder ectodermal involvement. Here, we report three new unrelated ADULT syndrome families, all with mutations of arginine 298. On basis of 16 patients in five families with R298 mutation, we delineate the ADULT syndrome phenotype. In addition, we have documented a gain-of-function effect on the dNp63gamma isoform caused by this mutation. We discuss the possible relevance of oral squamous cell carcinoma in one patient, who carries this p63 germline mutation.\n",
      "We report on two unrelated patients with an apparently new syndrome. In each family they are the only affected members, their parents are not consanguineous, and paternal and maternal ages are not advanced. At birth each patient was noted to have a marked Robin phenotype (cleft of the secondary palate and micrognathia) plus rhizomelic shortness. Delay in the appearance of long bone epiphyses was noted and followed by small fragmented and later very flat epiphyses of all long bones. The fibulae are short and radial heads dislocated. Scoliosis and marked genu valgum developed in both. Both patients have normal intelligence, vision, and hearing. Both have mildly upward slanting palpebral fissures, broad nasal tip, and apparent hypertelorism.\n",
      "Marchiafava-Bignami disease (MBD) is a rare disorder of an unknown aetiology but strongly associated with alcoholism. MBD primarily affects the corpus callosum leading to confusion, dysarthria, seizures and frequently to death. Over 250 cases from all races and from almost all nationalities have been reported, most cases being alcoholics. We report two cases with a favourable outcome. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a typical lesion of the corpus callosum, in both patients. The patients, a 44-year-old male and a 40-year-old female, presented with depressed consciousness and a variety of other symptoms, but finally made a reasonably good recovery leading to home discharge. To the best of our knowledge, only one additional case of MBD from Scandinavia has been published. As alcoholism is a major public health problem in Scandinavia, we assume that MBD is underdiagnosed and/or under-reported. Non-specific general symptoms and encephalopathy in an alcoholic may harbour undiagnosed MBD. We suggest that the incidence of MBD may be higher and its prognosis may be milder than generally believed.\n",
      "INTRODUCTION: Adenosarcoma of the uterus is a rare tumor composed of benign epithelial and malignant stromal components, usually encountered in young women. Till date, more than 100 cases of mullerian adenosarcoma of the cervix with homologous elements have been reported. However, only 15 cases of mullerian adenosarcoma of the cervix with heterologous elements are reported. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We describe a case of mullerian adenosarcoma with heterologous elements of rhabdomyosarcoma and benign cartilage presenting as a cervical polyp in a young girl. The clinicopathological features and management of this rare entity is reviewed. CONCLUSION: Cervical adenosarcomas are rare tumors that may appear in reproductive age. Optimal therapy is still unclear, and a long-term follow-up is essential. Such cases need to be reported as accumulation of individual cases will be able to provide knowledge about its optimal therapy and prognosis.\n",
      "The present study describes seven patients with Nance-Horan syndrome, all referred to a specialized oral care unit in the Central Denmark Region. A literature search on \"Nance Horan Syndrome\" resulted in 53 publications among which 29 reported on dental findings. Findings reported in these papers have been systematized to obtain an overview of the reported findings and the terminology on dental morphology. All seven patients included in the present study showed deviations of crown morphology on incisors and/or molars. The only consistent and very clear dental aberration was alterations in the tooth morphology that is screwdriver-shaped incisors and bud molars being most pronounced in the permanent dentition, but were also present in the primary dentition. In addition, three patients had supernumerary teeth, and three had dental agenesis. In conclusion, a dental examination as a part of the diagnostic process may reveal distinct characteristics of the dental morphology, which could be of diagnostic value and facilitate an early diagnosis. In the description of molar morphology in NHS patients, it is recommended to use the term \"bud molar.\" The combination of congenital cataract, screwdriwer-shaped incisors and bud-shaped molars is a strong clinical indication of Nance-Horan syndrome. ¬© 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\n",
      "BACKGROUND: The central nervous system originates ontogenetically from the ectoderm and therefore numerous neurocutaneous syndromes exist. OBJECTIVE: We describe a novel neurocutaneous syndrome with characteristic epidermal papules and plaques associated with mild psychomotor retardation and epilepsy with a good prognosis. METHODS: We investigated history, clinical features, laboratory parameters including karyotype, histopathological and immunohistological examination, electron microscopy, HPV infection, EEG and neurologic imaging in patients with an unusual symptom complex. RESULTS: Six children are reported with characteristic keratotic papules and plaques of 'gem-like' appearance, randomly distributed on the trunk and the proximal part of the limbs. Four patients were unrelated and two were siblings. The cutaneous lesions appeared congenitally or developed soon after birth. The skin lesions were rounded or of an irregularly polycyclic shape, ranging from 0.5 to 1.5 cm in diameter. A few to eighteen lesions were present. The lesional surface was rough and of white or yellowish color. Histopathological examination showed acanthokeratosis, but immunostaining for keratins and melanocytes, electron microscopy and laboratory results were within normal range. During the natural course of the disease the lesions were stable and asymptomatic. All but one of our six patients developed neurologic signs and symptoms during the first year of life, in the form of epilepsy and psychomotor delay. Five children had low intellectual performance together with EEG abnormalities and some had MRI changes of the brain. One patient had marked language impairment. The central nervous system involvement had a peculiar benign and self-limiting course and total normalization occurred in one case. LIMITATIONS: We present only a small series of patients. CONCLUSION: Cutaneous lesions showing identical clinical and microscopical features, but without any extracutaneous abnormalities, have recently been described by Torrelo et al. [J Am Acad Dermatol 2011;64:888-892] under the designation 'papular epidermal nevus with \"skyline\" basal cell layer (PENS)'. An association of such nevi with neurologic abnormalities had so far only been published in the 'Atlas of Genodermatoses' edited by Caputo and Tadini. We believe that this unique and otherwise undescribed symptom complex is a new neurocutaneous phenotype that may be called PENS syndrome. Whether this new syndrome can be categorized as a distinct phenotype within the group of epidermal nevus syndromes remains speculative and has to be clarified by further investigations.\n",
      "We report on the 46th patient with Schinzel-Giedion syndrome (SGS) and the first observation of splenopancreatic fusion in this syndrome. In the antenatal period, a male fetus was found to have bilateral hydronephrosis. Postnatally, in keeping with a diagnosis of SGS, there were large fontanelles, ocular hypertelorism, a wide, broad forehead, midface retraction, a short, upturned nose, macroglossia, and a short neck. Other anomalies included cardiac defects, widened and dense long bone cortices, cerebral ventriculomegaly, and abnormal fundi. Splenopancreatic fusion, usually encountered in trisomy 13, was found on autopsy. Schinzel-Giedion syndrome is likely a monogenic condition for which neither the heritability pattern nor pathogenesis has yet been determined. A clinical diagnosis may be made by identifying the facial phenotype, including prominent forehead, midface retraction, and short, upturned nose, plus one of either of the two other major distinguishing features: typical skeletal abnormalities or hydronephrosis. Typical skeletal anomalies include a sclerotic skull base, wide supraoccipital-exoccipital synchondrosis, increased cortical density or thickness, and broad ribs. Other highly supportive features include neuroepithelial tumors (found in 17%), hypertrichosis, and brain abnormalities. Severe developmental delay and poor survival are constant features in reported patients.\n",
      "Satoyoshi syndrome (SS) (OMIM 600705) is a rare multisystemic disorder of unknown etiology characterized by progressive painful intermittent muscle spasm, alopecia universalis, diarrhea, short stature, amenorrhea, and secondary skeletal abnormalities mimicking a metaphyseal chondrodysplasia. To date all reported cases have been sporadic. We describe a 26-year-old Mexican woman, a product of consanguineous parents with clinical characteristics of SS. Our patient, also showed skeletal anomalies not previously reported that seems to be a coincidental finding.\n",
      "We describe a female child with a ring chromosome 3, found after investigation for short stature. Her karyotype was 46,XX,r(3)(p26-q29). Her phenotype mainly differs from that of the nine patients previously reported with ring chromosome 3, by the presence of hypoplastic right thumb and bilateral coloboma of the iris.\n",
      "Alpha feto-protein (AFP) is a major plasma protein produced by the yolk sac and the liver during the fetal period. During the second trimester of pregnancy, APF and betahCG serum concentrations are commonly used for screening Down syndrome. AFP deficiency is rare (estimated to be 1/105,000 newborns) and only one sequence alteration has previously been reported in the AFP gene. We report a new mutation in exon 5 of the AFP gene, leading to a total absence of AFP on 2nd-trimester maternal serum screening for Down syndrome, confirmed on the amniotic fluid. Despite this, fetal development and birth were normal. After PCR-amplification, the whole AFP gene was sequenced. The new mutation was a guanine to adenine transition in position 543 creating a premature stop codon in position 181. In order to search for eventual modifications of the amniotic fluid profile, proteins were separated by electrophoresis and compared with 10 normal amniotic fluids sampled at the same developmental age (18 weeks). In the amniotic fluid of our patient albumin rate was reduced whereas alpha1 and beta protein fractions were increased, suggesting that AFP deficiency may modify the distribution of protein fractions. This observation emphasizes the complex molecular mechanisms of compensation of serum protein deficiency. Studies on other families with AFP deficiency are necessary to confirm this observation.\n",
      "We report on a patient with a constellation of anomalies including hamartomas of the tongue, polysyndactyly, and atrioventricular canal. A similar association has been previously described by Orstavik et al in two sibs. The clinical spectrum of the oralfacial-digital syndrome (OFDS) type II includes all these features. In particular, congenital heart defect, mainly atrioventricular canal, has been described in a few cases. It has been previously suggested that these latter patients may be affected by a variant of OFDS type II. We propose to distinguish this orocardiodigital variant and point out the association of the syndrome with atrioventricular canal.\n",
      "The main factor influencing the sex determination of an embryo is the genetic sex determined by the presence or absence of the Y chromosome. However, some individuals carry a Y chromosome but are phenotypically female (46,XY females) or have a female karyotype but are phenotypically male (46,XX males). 46,XX maleness is a rare sex reversal syndrome affecting 1 in 20,000 newborn males. Molecular analysis of sex-reversed patients led to the discovery of the SRY gene (sex-determining region on Y). The presence of SRY causes the bipotential gonad to develop into a testis. The majority of 46, SRY-positive XX males have normal genitalia; in contrast SRY-negative XX males usually have genital ambiguity. A small number of SRY-positive XX males also present with ambiguous genitalia. Phenotypic variability observed in 46,XX sex reversed patients cannot be explained only by the presence or absence of SRY despite the fact that SRY is considered to be the major regulatory factor for testis determination. There must be some other genes either in the Y or other autosomal chromosomes involved in the definition of phenotype. In this article, we evaluate four patients with 46,XX male syndrome with various phenotypes. Two of these cases are among the first reported to be diagnosed prenatally.\n",
      "GRID2 is a member of the ionotropic glutamate receptor family of excitatory neurotransmitter receptors. GRID2 encodes the glutamate receptor subunit delta-2, selectively expressed in cerebellar Purkinje cells. The phenotype associated with loss of GRID2 function was described only in mice until now, characterized by different degrees of cerebellar ataxia and usually relatively mild abnormalities of the cerebellum. This work describes for the first time the human phenotype associated with homozygous partial deletion of GRID2 in 3 children in one large consanguineous Turkish family. Homozygous deletion of exons 3 and 4 of GRID2 (94¬†153¬†589-94¬†298¬†037¬†bp) in the proband and similarly affected cousins, and heterozygous deletions in parental DNA were shown using Affymetrix¬Æ 6.0 single-nucleotide polymorphism array, confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. The phenotype includes nystagmus, hypotonia with marked developmental delay in gross motor skills in early infancy followed by a static encephalopathy course with development of cerebellar ataxia, oculomotor apraxia, and pyramidal tract involvement.\n",
      "Interstitial deletions of the long arm of chromosome 12 are rare and only few cases have been reported in literature so far, with different phenotypic features related to size and gene content of deleted regions. Five patients reported a 12q15-q21 deletion, sharing a 1.3¬†Mb small region of overlap (SRO) and presenting with developmental delay, nasal speech and mild dysmorphic features. We identified by microarray analysis a new case of 12q15 deletion. Our patient clinical features allow the refinement of the SRO to CNOT2, KCNMB4, and PTPRB genes, improving genotype-phenotype correlations.\n",
      "Seven years follow-up and re-examinations of a boy and his mother with \"familial benign copper deficiency\" revealed repeatedly subnormal serum copper and normal caeruloplasmin levels with relatively good psychosomatic development in the 9-year-old index patient. 64Cu-uptake was elevated in the mother's and normal in the proband's fibroblasts. The pathomechanism of the condition remained unknown, but the biochemical findings and the clinical course did not correspond to any of the previously described forms of congenital defects of copper metabolism.\n",
      "Global developmental delay is a serious social problem. It is often unrecognized and the phenotypes are inadequately studied. To investigate the phenotypes of children with aspecific central nervous system (CNS) impairment (poor speech, maladaptive behavioral symptoms such as temper tantrums, aggressiveness, poor concentration and attention, impulsiveness, and mental retardation). SETTING: Tertiary care hospital. PATIENTS: Three children (two male siblings, and one unrelated girl). METHODS: We used the results from clinical neurological evaluations; imaging and electrodiagnostic studies; metabolic and genetic tests; skin biopsies and bone mineral densitometry. All three children suffered from (A) global developmental delay, (B) osteopenia, and (C) identical skin defects. The skin ultrastructural abnormalities were abnormal keratin differentiation, consisting of hyperkeratosis and granular layer thickening; sweat gland abnormalities, consisting of focal, cytoplasmic clear changes in eccrine secretory cells; and melanocyte abnormalities, with both morphological changes (reduced number and size without evident dendritic processes), and functional changes (defects in the migration of melanosomes in the keratinocytes). These patients present a previously unrecognized syndrome. We retain useful to report this new association, to be recognized, in the next future, as a specific key-sign of a well-defined genetic defect.\n",
      "A new neuro-ophthalmological syndrome has been described recently, consisting of paroxysmal tonic upward deviation of the eyes with ataxia. Episodes occur daily and are always relieved by sleep. Onset is usually under one year of age and the symptoms gradually disappear during childhood. The authors describe three new patients in whom an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance was a constant finding, as well as clumsiness and delayed acquisition of independent gait. Treatment with levodopa was of clear benefit.\n",
      "Mutations in alpha-B crystallin gene (CRYAB) have been described to cause congenital cataracts, dilated cardiomyopathy and myofibrillar myopathy. For skeletal myopathy, only three different mutations have been reported within the last decade. Here we describe for the first time the missense mutation p.Gly154Ser to be associated with a late-onset distal vacuolar myopathy with protein aggregates without respiratory or cardiac dysfunction, and without significant cataracts. The mutation affects a residue in a highly preserved domain of alpha-B crystallin and has been identified earlier in patients with isolated cardiomyopathy.\n",
      "We report three male siblings with mild mental retardation, congenital cataract, sensorineural deafness, hypogonadism, hypertrichosis and short stature. This combination has not been previously reported and we suggest this is a new syndrome. Although X-linked recessive inheritance cannot be fully excluded, we favour autosomal recessive inheritance because of parental consanguinity.\n",
      "We report here the identification of a patient with muscle-specific glycogen synthase deficiency. The 8-year-old patient showed no prior signs of distress before collapsing during a bout of exercise, resulting in death. Initial post-mortem analysis of tissues suggested death was due to metabolic complications of mitochondrial myopathy, but upon further examination it was found that the anomalies were indicative of mitochondrial proliferation and oxidative compensation. A homozygous two base pair deletion was identified in exon 2 of GYS1, and the parents and sibling were confirmed as heterozygous carriers of the deletion. This case highlights the importance of differentiating between mitochondrial compensatory phenomena and true mitochondrial disease, and suggests that GYS1 deficiency could be a common cause of sudden cardiac death in children. Children with abnormal cardiac responses to increased workloads as well as those with defined myocardial disease should therefore be tested for GYS1 deficiency.\n",
      "We report on a girl aged 7 years with normal mental development but an unusual form of mandibulofacial dysostosis. The hallmarks of the syndrome are a round, flat face, severe hypertelorism, downslanting palpebral fissures extending to the temples, a broad nasal base, anteverted nares, small, posteriorly rotated ears, a long, smooth philtrum, a thin upper lip, striking macrostomia, retrognathism with reduced height of the mandible, and irregularly placed teeth, some to them missing.\n",
      "Two sisters showed a similar disorder with cachexia, sensory deafness, and upper gastrointestinal abnormalities. The family pedigree suggests autosomal recessive inheritance of the disorder. Demyelinization demonstrated by a peripheral nerve biopsy may explain the basis for the manifestations. Only one family with this unique syndrome has been reported in the literature. The term \"The Groll-Hirschowitz Syndrome\" has been suggested, named after the two physicians who first described this condition.\n",
      "METHODS AND RESULTS: We identified de novo submicroscopic chromosome 14q11.2 deletions in two children with idiopathic developmental delay and cognitive impairment. Vancouver patient 5566 has a approximately 200 kb deletion and Vancouver patient 8326 has a approximately 1.6 Mb deletion. The Database of Chromosomal Imbalance and Phenotype in Humans using Ensembl Resources (DECIPHER) revealed a third patient with idiopathic developmental delay and cognitive impairment, DECIPHER patient 126, who has a approximately 1.1 Mb deletion of 14q11.2. The deletion of patient 5566 overlaps that of patient 126 and both of these deletions lie entirely within that of patient 8326. All three children have similar dysmorphic features, including widely-spaced eyes, short nose with flat nasal bridge, long philtrum, prominent Cupid's bow of the upper lip, full lower lip and similar auricular anomalies. CONCLUSION: The minimal common deletion region on chromosome 14q11.2 is only approximately 35 kb (from 20.897 to 20.932, University of California at Santa Cruz (UCSC) Genome Browser; build hg18, March 2006) and includes only two genes, SUPT16H and CHD8, which are good candidate genes for the phenotypes. The non-recurrent breakpoints of these patients, the presence of normal copy number variants in the region and the local genomic structure support the notion that this region has reduced stability.\n",
      "A 6 1/2 year old male presented with acrocephaly, brachydactyly, clinodactyly, mild syndactyly of the hands and feet, genu valgum, and marked obesity. Roentgenograms of the hands revealed hypoplasia or aplasia of the middle phalanges. Roentgenograms of the feet revealed hypoplasia of the middle phalanges and deformity of the proximal phalangeal epiphyses of the great toes. Chromosomes studies revealed a normal 46,XY karyotype, and psychological testing revealed low normal intelligence. Current data support autosomal recessive inheritance, although X-linkage cannot be excluded.\n",
      "Two teen-age XY brothers with mental retardation, short stature, obesity, genital abnormalities, and contractures of their hands are described. They have generalized osteoporosis and a history of frequent fractures. Their endocrinologic evaluation was normal except for mild glucose intolerance and delayed, but normal puberty. Although these brothers are similar to individuals with Prader-Willi syndrome, their unusual hand contractures, clinically significant osteoporosis, and lack of hypotonia indicate that they represent a different entity.\n",
      "Gershoni-Baruch syndrome is an extremely rare malformation complex characterized by omphalocele, diaphragmatic hernia, radial ray defects, and cardiovascular abnormalities. Autosomal recessive inheritance was suggested. To date, academic literature described only seven patients fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for the condition. None survived the neonatal period. This study reports the first individual with Gershoni-Baruch syndrome surviving past early infancy.\n",
      "X-linked dominant protoporphyria (XLDPP) was first reported in the genetics literature in 2008. It has a phenotype very similar to erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP), but is distinguished from EPP by higher concentrations of erythrocyte protoporphyrin (of which a high proportion is zinc-chelated), its apparently higher incidence of liver disease, and an X-linked dominant pattern of inheritance. Dermatologists should understand how XLDPP differs from EPP, in order to advise newly diagnosed patients correctly about the genetic implications and the long-term management strategy. We present a case series of XLDPP to introduce this condition to the dermatology literature.\n",
      "We studied two unrelated boys with intellectual disability (ID) and a striking facial resemblance suggestive of a hitherto unappreciated syndrome. Exome sequencing in both families identified identical de novo mutations in PACS1, suggestive of causality. To support these genetic findings and to understand the pathomechanism of the mutation, we studied the protein in vitro and in vivo. Altered PACS1 forms cytoplasmic aggregates in vitro with concomitant increased protein stability and shows impaired binding to an isoform-specific variant of TRPV4, but not the full-length protein. Furthermore, consistent with the human pathology, expression of mutant PACS1 mRNA in zebrafish embryos induces craniofacial defects most likely in a dominant-negative fashion. This phenotype is driven by aberrant specification and migration of SOX10-positive cranial, but not enteric, neural-crest cells. Our findings suggest that PACS1 is necessary for the formation of craniofacial structures and that perturbation of its functions results in a specific syndromic ID phenotype.\n",
      "Metachromatic leukodystrophy is a lysosomal storage disorder with an estimated incidence of 1:40,000. Magnetic resonance imaging at time of diagnosis often shows symmetric white matter involvement, sparing the arcuate fibers. A 25-month-old female child presented with a cranial neuropathy, a spastic gait, decreased leukocyte arylsulfatase-A activity, and elevated urinary sulfatides. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed multiple cranial nerve enhancement, without intraparenchymal white matter involvement.\n",
      "Cell survival critically depends on the integrity of mitochondria, which play a pivotal role during apoptosis. Extensive mitochondrial damage promotes release of pro-apoptotic factors from the intermembrane space of mitochondria. Released mitochondrial proteins include Smac/DIABLO and HTRA2/Omi, which inhibit the cytosolic E3 ubiquitin ligase XIAP and other inhibitors of apoptosis proteins.Here we investigated the cause of extreme hypertonia at birth, alternating with hypotonia, with the subsequent appearance of extrapyramidal symptoms, lack of psychomotor development, microcephaly, intractable seizures and early death in four patients from two unrelated families. The patients showed lactic acidemia, 3-methylglutaconic aciduria, intermittent neutropenia, evolving brain atrophy and disturbed cristae structure in muscle mitochondria.Using whole-exome sequencing, we identified missplicing mutation and a 5√¢‚Ç¨‚Ä¶bp deletion in HTRA2, encoding HTRA2/Omi. This protein was completely absent from the patients' fibroblasts, whose growth was impaired and which were hypersensitive to apoptosis. Expression of HtrA2/Omi or of the proteolytically inactive HTRA2/Omi protein restored the cells' apoptotic resistance. However, cell growth was only restored by the proteolytically active protein.This is the first report of recessive deleterious mutations in HTRA2 in human. The clinical phenotype, the increased apoptotic susceptibility and the impaired cell growth recapitulate those observed in the Htra2 knockout mice and in mutant mice with proteolytically inactive HTRA2/Omi. Together, they underscore the importance of both chaperone and proteolytic activities of HTRA2/Omi for balanced apoptosis sensitivity and for brain development. Absence of HTRA2/Omi is associated with severe neurodegenerative disorder of infancy, abnormal mitochondria, 3-methylglutaconic aciduria and increased sensitivity to apoptosis.\n",
      "A mentally retarded girl with congenital blepharophimosis, ptosis, hypoplastic teeth and other traits consistent with Ohdo syndrome is reported. Her mother had had surgery for blepharophimosis as a small child, but did not fulfil the other criteria for Ohdo syndrome. The mother had also been abusing alcohol prior to the pregnancy. Differential diagnoses and possible modes of inheritance are discussed.\n",
      "Inherited ataxias are heterogeneous disorders affecting both children and adults, with over 40 different causative genes, making molecular genetic diagnosis challenging. Although recent advances in next-generation sequencing have significantly improved mutation detection, few treatments exist for patients with inherited ataxia. In two patients with adult-onset cerebellar ataxia and coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) deficiency in muscle, whole exome sequencing revealed mutations in ANO10, which encodes anoctamin 10, a member of a family of putative calcium-activated chloride channels, and the causative gene for autosomal recessive spinocerebellar ataxia-10 (SCAR10). Both patients presented with slowly progressive ataxia and dysarthria leading to severe disability in the sixth decade. Epilepsy and learning difficulties were also present in one patient, while retinal degeneration and cataract were present in the other. The detection of mutations in ANO10 in our patients indicate that ANO10 defects cause secondary low CoQ10 and SCAR10 patients may benefit from CoQ10 supplementation.\n",
      "Mitochondrial presequence proteases perform fundamental functions as they process about 70¬†% of all mitochondrial preproteins that are encoded in the nucleus and imported posttranslationally. The mitochondrial intermediate presequence protease MIP/Oct1, which carries out precursor processing, has not yet been established to have a role in human disease.Whole exome sequencing was performed on four unrelated probands with left ventricular non-compaction (LVNC), developmental delay (DD), seizures, and severe hypotonia. Proposed pathogenic variants were confirmed by Sanger sequencing or array comparative genomic hybridization. Functional analysis of the identified MIP variants was performed using the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae as the protein and its functions are highly conserved from yeast to human.Biallelic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) or copy number variants (CNVs) in MIPEP, which encodes MIP, were present in all four probands, three of whom had infantile/childhood death. Two patients had compound heterozygous SNVs (p.L582R/p.L71Q and p.E602*/p.L306F) and one patient from a consanguineous family had a homozygous SNV (p.K343E). The fourth patient, identified through the GeneMatcher tool, a part of the Matchmaker Exchange Project, was found to have inherited a paternal SNV (p.H512D) and a maternal CNV (1.4-Mb deletion of 13q12.12) that includes MIPEP. All amino acids affected in the patients' missense variants are highly conserved from yeast to human and therefore S. cerevisiae was employed for functional analysis (for p.L71Q, p.L306F, and p.K343E). The mutations p.L339F (human p.L306F) and p.K376E (human p.K343E) resulted in a severe decrease of Oct1 protease activity and accumulation of non-processed Oct1 substrates and consequently impaired viability under respiratory growth conditions. The p.L83Q (human p.L71Q) failed to localize to the mitochondria.Our findings reveal for the first time the role of the mitochondrial intermediate peptidase in human disease. Loss of MIP function results in a syndrome which consists of LVNC, DD, seizures, hypotonia, and cataracts. Our approach highlights the power of data exchange and the importance of an interrelationship between clinical and research efforts for disease gene discovery.\n",
      "We report 4 patients and their extended families comprising 17 cases, all of whom had congenital exfoliative erythroderma resistant to treatment, associated with failure to thrive and hypoalbuminaemia. All died in the first year of life. This condition appears to be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and the underlying defect remains unknown.\n",
      "The association of dentinogenesis imperfecta (DI) with a distinct form of chondrodysplasia in a boy was reported by Goldblatt et al. [1991; Am J Med Genet 39:170-172] and has been given the name of Goldblatt syndrome or odontochondrodysplasia (ODCD; OMIM#184260). Since the original description, only four further individuals have been reported (one sib pair and two unrelated cases). We report on an additional six individuals, including a second sib pair (brother and sister), with clinical and radiographic features that cluster and thus confirm the nosologic status of this entity. The main radiographic features are congenital platyspondyly with coronal clefts, severe metaphyseal changes particularly of the hands, wrists, and knees, mesomelic limb shortening, and coxa valga. The main physical signs are short stature, joint laxity, narrow chest, scoliosis, and DI. This combination of clinical and radiographic findings allows clear recognition of this syndrome in early childhood. Of note, the signs that are present in the newborn period are not entirely specific and the differential diagnosis includes spondylometaphyseal dysplasia (SMD) Sedaghatian type or platyspondylic lethal dysplasia (PSLD) Torrance type. The occurrence of two sib pairs in a group of only 11 patients suggests an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. Overmodification of cartilage-extracted collagen 2 has been reported in two sibs, but mutation analysis of COL2A1 as well as of COMP, FGFR3, RMRP, and SBDS in one or more patients have given negative results, and the molecular etiology is as yet unknown.\n",
      "We describe an unusual infant with the diagnosis of alveolar capillary dysplasia who had a relatively prolonged life without extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). We have used this case as a springboard for a thorough review of the literature. This was a full-term female infant who presented with a picture of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn. She was treated as such, with various ventilatory modes, alkalinizing agents, surfactant therapy, tolazoline, prostacyclin and nitric oxide. Because of the prolonged clinical course the possibility of alveolar capillary dysplasia was raised. The parents refused ECMO. Despite all efforts she progressively deteriorated and died at 22 days of age. Macro- and microscopic examination of the lung at autopsy were diagnostic of alveolar capillary dysplasia. A detailed review of 39 cases published in the literature with comments regarding incidence, etiology, pathophysiology, clinical picture, diagnosis and treatment is presented.\n",
      "Identification of the molecular etiologies of primary immunodeficiencies has led to important insights into the development and function of the immune system. We report here the cause of combined immunodeficiency in 4 patients from 2 different consanguineous Qatari families with similar clinical and immunologic phenotypes. The patients presented at an early age with fungal, viral, and bacterial infections and hypogammaglobulinemia. Although their B- and T-cell numbers were normal, they had low regulatory T-cell and NK-cell numbers. Moreover, patients' T cells were mostly CD45RA(+)-naive cells and were defective in activation after T-cell receptor stimulation. All patients contained the same homozygous nonsense mutation in IKBKB (R286X), revealed by whole-exome sequencing with undetectable IKKŒ≤ and severely decreased NEMO proteins. Mutant IKKŒ≤(R286X) was unable to complex with IKKŒ±/NEMO. Immortalized patient B cells displayed impaired IŒ∫BŒ± phosphorylation and NFŒ∫B nuclear translocation. These data indicate that mutated IKBKB is the likely cause of immunodeficiency in these 4 patients.\n",
      "Patients with nonketotic hyperglycinemia and deficient glycine cleavage enzyme activity, but without mutations in AMT, GLDC or GCSH, the genes encoding its constituent proteins, constitute a clinical group which we call 'variant nonketotic hyperglycinemia'. We hypothesize that in some patients the aetiology involves genetic mutations that result in a deficiency of the cofactor lipoate, and sequenced genes involved in lipoate synthesis and iron-sulphur cluster biogenesis. Of 11 individuals identified with variant nonketotic hyperglycinemia, we were able to determine the genetic aetiology in eight patients and delineate the clinical and biochemical phenotypes. Mutations were identified in the genes for lipoate synthase (LIAS), BolA type 3 (BOLA3), and a novel gene glutaredoxin 5 (GLRX5). Patients with GLRX5-associated variant nonketotic hyperglycinemia had normal development with childhood-onset spastic paraplegia, spinal lesion, and optic atrophy. Clinical features of BOLA3-associated variant nonketotic hyperglycinemia include severe neurodegeneration after a period of normal development. Additional features include leukodystrophy, cardiomyopathy and optic atrophy. Patients with lipoate synthase-deficient variant nonketotic hyperglycinemia varied in severity from mild static encephalopathy to Leigh disease and cortical involvement. All patients had high serum and borderline elevated cerebrospinal fluid glycine and cerebrospinal fluid:plasma glycine ratio, and deficient glycine cleavage enzyme activity. They had low pyruvate dehydrogenase enzyme activity but most did not have lactic acidosis. Patients were deficient in lipoylation of mitochondrial proteins. There were minimal and inconsistent changes in cellular iron handling, and respiratory chain activity was unaffected. Identified mutations were phylogenetically conserved, and transfection with native genes corrected the biochemical deficiency proving pathogenicity. Treatments of cells with lipoate and with mitochondrially-targeted lipoate were unsuccessful at correcting the deficiency. The recognition of variant nonketotic hyperglycinemia is important for physicians evaluating patients with abnormalities in glycine as this will affect the genetic causation and genetic counselling, and provide prognostic information on the expected phenotypic course.\n",
      "The present report describes two sibs with lethal acrorenal developmental complex who were products of a nonconsanguinous marriage. Clinical and roentgenologic characteristics did not match any of the known types of fibuloulnar dysostosis. Distinct abnormalities included lethality at birth, facial anomalies, ear anomalies, symmetrical mesomelic shortness of long bones, fibular agenesis, normal vertebrae, oligosyndactyly of phalanges, congenital heart defect, and cystic or hypoplastic kidney. These cases suggest a new lethal form of recessively inherited fibuloulnar dysostosis with renal anomalies.\n",
      "We report on 2 phenotypic sisters, one with 46,XY; the other with 46,XX. The 2 girls had similar related internal malformations, including agonadism, hypoplasia of the right pulmonary artery, hypoplasia of the right lung, isolated dextrocardia with complex vitium cordis, and diaphragmatic hernia (only sib 1) or omphalocele (only sib 2). This combination of malformations did not fit into any of the previously described syndromes. For this syndrome we suggest the acronym PAGOD ([hypoplasia of the] pulmo, and pulmonary artery, agonadism, omphalocele/diaphragmatic defect, dextrocardia). The occurrence of a basically similar set of malformations in 2 unlike sex is interpreted as evidence for autosomal recessive inheritance. The different gonosomal status excludes the Y chromosome as a responsible factor. The peculiar finding of a 46,XX sex chromosome constitution combined with agonadism and an intact urogenitral tract emphasizes the concept of secondary regression of Wolffian and M√ºllerian structures. The associated malformations of mesodermal structures can be interpreted as midline defects. We suggest that, from the developmental field perspective, secondary regression of midline structures including the gonadal anlage explains the pathogenesis reasonably well.\n",
      "Osteolysis syndromes are characterized by resorption of affected bones with associated swelling and pain. Various forms of multicentric osteolysis syndromes including autosomal dominant and recessive carpal-tarsal osteolysis, Torg, Fran√É¬ßois, Whyte-Hemingway, Hajdu-Cheney, Winchester, and other forms have been described. Most present in pre-school years with extensive involvement and destruction of multiple bones. We present a sister-pair, both of whom presented in early teenage, i.e., 13 and 15.5 years, respectively, with bilateral ankle, knee, and later, wrist pain. Radiological examination revealed bilateral osteolysis of tali, scaphoids, and patellae, and short fourth metacarpals in both sisters. Further investigation revealed absence of renal involvement, a normal excretion of amino acids, mucopolysaccharides and oligosaccharides, and presence of chronic synovitis in both sisters. Both parents and a younger brother were without radiographic or clinical evidence of the disease and there was no history of consanguinity. Thus, our sister-pair presented with the same carpal and tarsal bone involvement at a much later age, with evidence of chronic synovitis, along with short fourth metacarpals (brachydactyly type E changes) and without renal disease, suggesting a new syndrome with probable autosomal recessive inheritance.\n",
      "A father and daughter with apparently unique clinical findings are described. The findings include persistent Wormian bones, blue sclerae, mandibular hypoplasia, shallow glenoid fossae and campomelia. Apparently it is an autosomal dominant trait. Although the disorder is in the osteogenesis imperfecta group, nevertheless it appears to be different and until the basic defect is found we have named it \"The Grant Syndrome\".\n",
      "It is still controversial if idiopathic focal myositis is a part of systemic polymyositis. We present here four patients, including identical twins, with focal myositis accompanied by the same HLA typings. Gradually developing unilateral calf muscle pain was an initial symptom in all patients. Neither muscular weakness nor creatine kinase (CK) elevation was observed, while minimal inflammatory findings such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) increase appeared in serum. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed localized abnormalities of calf muscles. Biopsy specimen was characterized by perimysial and endomysial inflammatory infiltration consisted of T cells and macrophages and rare necrotic fibers. Corticosteroid administrations ameliorated their symptoms and signs, though recurrence occurred along with decreasing doses. HLA typings common to all patients were A2, B62, Cw3, and DQ3, whereas HLA-D DNA typings were DQB1 *0303 for two patients, and DQB1*0302 for three patients. These findings suggest that at least some focal myositis may be a new disease unit, with a common genetic background but not a part of systemic polymyositis.\n",
      "A mother and two children with trichodysplasia, hypodontia, onychodysplasia (not present in the mother), mild skin alterations, bilateral inward deflection of the 4th toes, and other findings are described. This is an ectodermal dysplasia of the tricho-odonto-onychial subgroup probably due to an autosomal dominant gene.\n",
      "Lamb-Shaffer syndrome (OMIM: 616803) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by developmental delay, mild to moderate intellectual disability, speech delay, and mild characteristic facial appearance caused by SOX5 haploinsufficiency on chromosome 12p12.1. There are clinical variabilities among the patients with genomic alterations, such as intragenic deletions, a point mutation, and a chromosomal translocation of t(11;12)(p13;p12.1), in SOX5. We report herein a 5-year-old Japanese male with a de novo balanced reciprocal translocation t(12;20)(p12.1;p12.3) presenting a mild intellectual disability, speech delay, characteristic facial appearance, and autistic features. We determined the translocation breakpoints of the patient to be in intron 4 of SOX5 and the intergenic region in 20p12.3 via FISH and nucleotide sequence analyses. Thus, the present patient has SOX5 haploinsufficiency affecting 2 long forms of SOX5 and is the second reported case of Lamb-Shaffer syndrome caused by a de novo balanced reciprocal translocation. This report confirmed that haploinsufficiency of the 2 long forms of SOX5 presents common clinical features, including mild intellectual disability and autistic features, which could be useful for the clinical diagnosis of Lamb-Shaffer syndrome.\n",
      "To investigate the genetic cause for a child with developmental delay and congenital heart disease through molecular cytogenetic analysis.G-banded karyotyping and chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) were performed for the patient and his parents.The proband's karyotype was detected as ring chromosome 3, and a 3q26.3-25.3 deletion encompassing 45 genes has been found with CMA. Testing of both parents was normal.Clinical phenotype of the patient with ring chromosome 3 mainly depends on the involved genes. It is necessary to combine CMA and karyotyping for the diagnosis of ring chromosome, as CMA can provide more accurate information for variations of the genome.\n",
      "Dentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is a rare, autosomal dominant, clinically heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder characterised clinically by progressive dementia, ataxia, chorea, myoclonic epilepsy and psychiatric disturbance and pathologically by combined degeneration of the dentatorubral and pallidoluysian systems. DRPLA has a marked ethnic predilection, most commonly reported in Japan and thought to be rare in Caucasian populations.We describe the clinical and genetic characteristics of 17 patients with DRPLA segregating in four families in South Wales.There was marked clinical heterogeneity with considerable overlap of symptoms and signs between and within families. The age of onset ranged from 34 to 60 years with an earlier onset associated with myoclonic epilepsy and a later onset associated with a Huntington disease-like presentation. We identified a distinct haplotype within one family not present within the other three families, suggesting that the expansion in at least one family did not arise from an immediate common ancestor. Analysis of repeat length polymorphisms in 306 Welsh control patients identified 14 (4.6%) with repeat lengths in the high-normal range, compared with 0% and 7.4% in previously reported north American Caucasian and Japanese control populations, respectively.DRPLA may not be as geographically or ethnically restricted as previously thought and the diagnosis should be considered in non-Asian patients presenting with a wide spectrum of neurological disease, especially if there is a dominant family history of dementia or movement disorder. The prevalence of high-normal length alleles may account for the relatively high prevalence of DRPLA in Wales.\n",
      "Two normally developed Assyrian brothers with isolated pancreatic co-lipase deficiency are described. They presented at the age of 5-6 years with loose stools. They had steatorrhoea, and analysis of exocrine pancreatic enzymes in the small intestine showed co-lipase deficiency, while amylase, chymotrypsin, trypsin and lipase were normal. Intraduodenal infusion of purified co-lipase improved fat digestion measured by the triolein breath test. Their steatorrhoea diminished on treatment with enteric-coated pancreatic enzymes.\n",
      "Small interstitial deletions affecting chromosome region 3p25.3 have been reported in only five patients so far, four of them with overlapping telomeric microdeletions 3p25.3 and variable features of 3p- syndrome, and one patient with a small proximal microdeletion and a distinct phenotype with intellectual disability (ID) and multiple congenital anomalies. Here we report on three novel patients with overlapping proximal microdeletions 3p25.3 of 1.1-1.5‚ÄâMb in size showing a consistent non-3p- phenotype with ID, epilepsy/EEG abnormalities, poor speech, ataxia and stereotypic hand movements. The smallest region of overlap contains two genes encoding sodium- and chloride-dependent GABA transporters which have not been associated with this disease phenotype in humans so far. The protein function, the phenotype in transporter deficient animal models and the effects of specific pharmacological transporter inhibition in mice and humans provide evidence that these GABA transporters are plausible candidates for seizures/EEG abnormalities, ataxia and ID in this novel group of patients. A fourth novel patient deleted for a 3.16‚ÄâMb region, both telomeric and centromeric to 3p25.3, confirms that the telomeric segment is critical for the 3p- syndrome phenotype. Finally, a region of 643‚Äâkb is suggested to harbor one or more genes causative for polydactyly which is part of the 3p- syndrome.\n",
      "We present the clinical and radiographic findings in a mother and son with a dominantly inherited mesomelic skeletal dysplasia almost identical to that described in a large Thai family by Kantaputra et al., in which ankle, carpal and tarsal synostoses were noted. The proband in the family is a 48-year-old woman with mesomelic limb shortening, most pronounced in the upper limbs. Her parents were of normal stature and build. Her 15-year-old son has similar mesomelic limb shortening, and in addition talipes equinovarus. Radiological examination showed severe shortening of the radius and ulna with bowing of the radius and dislocation of the radial head. Multiple carpal and tarsal synostoses were present and in addition, the talus and calcaneum were fused. In the original Thai family, linkage to chromosome 2q24-q32, which contains the HOXD cluster has been reported, and it is postulated that the phenotype may result from a disturbance of regulation of the HOXD cluster. Although linkage analysis was not possible in our family, molecular analysis was undertaken and HOXD11 was sequenced, however, no mutations were detected. This is only the second reported family affected with Kantaputra mesomelic dysplasia (MIM 156232), a distinct mesomelic skeletal dysplasia.\n",
      "Amyloidosis is caused by extracellular deposition of proteins in an insoluble manner within tissues. In hereditary forms of amyloidosis, transthyretin, fibrinogen A-√é¬±, lysozyme, gelsolin, apolipoprotein A-I, and A-II accumulate in the tissue plaques. Here we describe a 52-year-old man with no family history of renal disease who presented with increased urinary frequency, gradual loss of renal function but no significant proteinuria. Renal biopsy found large amounts of amyloid restricted to the medulla with no involvement of glomeruli or vessels. Immunohistochemical analysis for transthyretin or serum amyloid A and tests for an underlying monoclonal gammopathy were negative. Although initially suspected to be amyloid light chain amyloidosis, laser microdissection and mass spectrometry showed that the amyloid was composed of large amounts of apolipoprotein A-IV. This was based on mass spectrometry studies that showed 100, 96, and 73 spectra in three microdissected samples that matched to apolipoprotein A-IV with 100% probability. DNA analyses detected three sequence variants representing common polymorphisms of the apolipoprotein A-IV gene. Thus, in this case, apolipoprotein A-IV deposition and renal involvement appear to be restricted to the medulla. A high degree of suspicion is required for the diagnosis of apolipoprotein A-IV amyloidosis as it may be missed if a renal biopsy consists only of cortex.\n",
      "We describe a previously not recognized nonsense mutation in exon 10 of the ALS2 gene in two sibs with infantile-onset ascending spastic paralysis. The mutation predicts chain termination at amino-acid position 715 of the gene product ALSIN (p.Gln715X). The sibs' parents are descendants of a common ancestor who lived in the northern Netherlands during the eighteenth century. This is the first ALS2 mutation detected in northwestern Europeans. The findings emphasize that mutations in ALS2 also need to be considered in patients from northwestern Europe with early-onset spastic paralysis and amyotrophic or primary lateral sclerosis.\n",
      "Karsch-Neugebauer syndrome is a rare congenital anomaly characterized by split foot, split hand anomalies in association with congenital nystagmus. It is an inherited condition and often occurs in both the hands and the feet. Its pattern of inheritance is autosomal dominant, though occasionally it can skip a generation. It affects about 1 in 90,000 babies, with males and females equally being affected. This rare syndrome may be associated with additional abnormalities such as hypodontia, delayed eruption, variation in morphology and position of teeth, but it is not widely documented. In view of the low incidence of this syndrome and of the limited number of reports on this in the literature, the objective of this article is to highlight the oral findings of this syndrome.\n",
      "The authors describe a patient with sporadic distal myopathy associated with reduced caveolin-3 in muscle fibers in which the muscle atrophy was restricted to the small muscles of the hands and feet. Gene analysis disclosed a heterozygous 80 G-->A substitution in the caveolin-3 gene that was identical to that of reported cases of elevated serum creatine kinase. This patient further demonstrated possible clinical heterogeneity of myopathies with mutations in the caveolin-3 gene.\n",
      "We describe two sisters with hydrocephalus, tall stature, joint laxity, and thoracolumbar kyphosis.\n",
      "In one family several male and female members had hypogonadism and frontoparietal alopecia, whereas other members with normal sexual development had normal scalp hair. Clinical and laboratory evaluation of three affected young men (two brothers and their cousin) revealed that the hypogonadism was the result of decreased serum concentrations of follicle stimulating and luteinizing hormones. There was no evidence of a deficiency of any other pituitary hormone. Long-term treatment of the three patients with human chorionic gonadotropin resulted in an increase in the serum testosterone concentration, the appearance of male secondary sex characteristics and an increase in the size of the external genitalia.\n",
      "CASE:Trevor disease (dysplasia epiphysealis hemimelica [DEH]) is a rare, intra-articular anomaly of cartilaginous overgrowth of the epiphysis. The usual presentation is on 1 side of the body and on 1 side of the epiphysis. The natural history of this disease is not clear because the lesions often are treated during childhood. Additionally, hip involvement is relatively uncommon; to our knowledge, total hip arthroplasty in a patient with DEH has not been reported previously. Our patient presented with previously untreated DEH of the hip joint, which had developed into a very unusual shape. He was treated with a total hip arthroplasty and had satisfactory functioning 2.5 years postsurgery. CONCLUSION:Untreated DEH of the hip can lead to a very misshapen hip with a deformed femoral head and loss of the shape of the acetabulum, as well as stiffness due to an unusual shape and osteoarthritic changes. A total hip arthroplasty can give satisfactory functional results.\n",
      "Various genetic defects cause autism associated with intellectual disability and epilepsy. Here, we set out to identify the genetic defect in a consanguineous Omani family with three affected children in whom mutations in known candidate genes had been excluded beforehand.For mutation screening, we combined autozygosity mapping and whole exome sequencing. Segregation of potential disease variants with the phenotype was verified by Sanger sequencing. A splice-site mutation was confirmed and quantified by qPCR.We found an autosomal recessive splice acceptor mutation in DEAF1 (c.997+4A>C, p.G292Pfs*) in all affected individuals, which led to exon skipping, and reduced the normal full-length mRNA copy number in the patients to 5% of the wild-type level. Besides intellectual disability and autism, two of three affected siblings suffered from severe epilepsy. All patients exhibited dyskinesia of the limbs coinciding with symmetric T2 hyperintensities of the basal ganglia on cranial MRI.A recent report has shown dominant DEAF1 mutations to occur de novo in patients with intellectual disability. Here, we demonstrate that a DEAF1-associated disorder can also be inherited as an autosomal recessive trait with heterozygous individuals being entirely healthy. Our findings expand the clinical and genetic spectrum of DEAF1 mutations to comprise epilepsy and extrapyramidal symptoms.\n",
      "OBJECTIVES: To report five cases of mosaic trisomy 16 with variable outcomes in the context of the literature on mosaic trisomy 16. Complications in these cases include preeclampsia, IUGR, fetal anomalies, and death, with no predictable pattern. METHODS: Observation of five new cases and statistical analysis of 125 reported cases of mosaic trisomy 16 with prenatal detection and outcome data. RESULTS: (1) IUGR, premature delivery, and/or physical anomalies are observed commonly, even when the trisomy is thought to be confined to the placenta; (2) Level II mosaicism for trisomy 16 in amniotic fluid may reflect a true mosaic state with phenotypic consequences; (3) FISH is more sensitive than traditional cytogenetics in detecting mosaicism in all tissue types examined; (4) hCG levels can be extremely elevated, and MS-AFP levels are often elevated; and (5) Uniparental disomy (UPD) increases the rates of IUGR and physical anomalies in CPM cases. CONCLUSION: While there is no obvious mosaic trisomy 16 syndrome, IUGR and heart defects commonly occur, even if the mosaicism appears to be confined to the placenta. A completely normal outcome occurs only in about 20% of the cases; however, complications can often be limited to prematurity, small-for-gestational-age infants, and/or minor or surgically reparable birth defects.\n",
      "BACKGROUND:The molecular cause of inflammatory bowel disease is largely unknown. METHODS:We performed genetic-linkage analysis and candidate-gene sequencing on samples from two unrelated consanguineous families with children who were affected by early-onset inflammatory bowel disease. We screened six additional patients with early-onset colitis for mutations in two candidate genes and carried out functional assays in patients' peripheral-blood mononuclear cells. We performed an allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation in one patient. RESULTS:In four of nine patients with early-onset colitis, we identified three distinct homozygous mutations in genes IL10RA and IL10RB, encoding the IL10R1 and IL10R2 proteins, respectively, which form a heterotetramer to make up the interleukin-10 receptor. The mutations abrogate interleukin-10-induced signaling, as shown by deficient STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) phosphorylation on stimulation with interleukin-10. Consistent with this observation was the increased secretion of tumor necrosis factor alpha and other proinflammatory cytokines from peripheral-blood mononuclear cells from patients who were deficient in IL10R subunit proteins, suggesting that interleukin-10-dependent \"negative feedback\" regulation is disrupted in these cells. The allogeneic stem-cell transplantation performed in one patient was successful. CONCLUSIONS:Mutations in genes encoding the IL10R subunit proteins were found in patients with early-onset enterocolitis, involving hyperinflammatory immune responses in the intestine. Allogeneic stem-cell transplantation resulted in disease remission in one patient.\n",
      "Waardenburg syndrome (WS) is a series of auditory-pigmentary disorders inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. In most patients, WS2 results from mutations in the MITF gene. MITF encodes a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that activates transcription of tyrosinase and other melanocyte proteins. The clinical presentation of WS is highly variable, and we believe that Tietz syndrome and WS2 with ocular albinism (OA) are likely two variations of WS2 due to the presence of modifiers. One family with a molecular diagnosis of WS2 co-segregating with OA has previously been reported. A digenic mutation mechanism including both a MITF mutation and the TYR(R402Q) hypomorphic allele was proposed to be the cause of OA in this family. Here, we present a second WS2 family with OA and provide evidence suggesting the TYR(R402Q) allele does not cause OA in this family. We hypothesize the presence of a novel OCA3 mutation together with the MITF del p.R217 mutation account for the OA phenotype in this family. Since MITF is a transcription factor for pigmentation genes, a mutation in MITF plus a heterozygous mutation in OCA3 together provide an adverse effect crossing a quantitative threshold; therefore, WS2 with OA occurs. We have hypothesized previously that the clinical spectrum and mutation mechanism of OCA depend on the pigmentation threshold of an affected individual. This unique family has provided further evidence supporting this hypothesis. We suggest that by studying OCA patients alongside WS patients with various pigmentation profiles we can facilitate further understanding of the pigmentation pathway.\n",
      "Carcinosarcomas of the uterine cervix are extremely rare. Cervical carcinosarcoma can be characterized by having two different origins: the M√ºllerian ducts and the mesonephric duct remnants. A 53-year-old Korean woman was admitted to the hospital because of pelvic mass detected on computed tomography scan done at private clinic. A Radical hysterectomy with bilateral salpingooophorectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy was carried out upon a diagnosis of stage IB2 cervical sarcoma. Immunohistochemically, the epithelial component was positive for pancytokeratin and estrogen receptor, but negative for CD 10 and carletinin. The mesenchymal component was positive for vimentin. The histopathologic diagnosis was a carcinosarcoma of the uterine cervix arising from M√ºllerian ducts. She underwent chemotherapy. She developed systemic recurrence seven months after operation and died of disease. The origin of cervical carcinosarcoma needs to be verified and immunohistochemical studies using mesonephric marker (CD 10, carletinin, and estrogen receptor) is helpful.\n",
      "In the PI(3,5)P2 biosynthetic complex, the lipid kinase PIKFYVE and the phosphatase FIG4 are bound to the dimeric scaffold protein VAC14, which is composed of multiple heat-repeat domains. Mutations of FIG4 result in the inherited disorders Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4J, Yunis-Var√≥n syndrome, and polymicrogyria with seizures. We here describe inherited variants of VAC14 in two unrelated children with sudden onset of a progressive neurological disorder and regression of developmental milestones. Both children developed impaired movement with dystonia, became nonambulatory and nonverbal, and exhibited striatal abnormalities on MRI. A diagnosis of Leigh syndrome was rejected due to normal lactate profiles. Exome sequencing identified biallelic variants of VAC14 that were inherited from unaffected heterozygous parents in both families. Proband 1 inherited a splice-site variant that results in skipping of exon 13, p.Ile459Profs(‚àó)4 (not reported in public databases), and the missense variant p.Trp424Leu (reported in the ExAC database in a single heterozygote). Proband 2 inherited two missense variants in the dimerization domain of VAC14, p.Ala582Ser and p.Ser583Leu, that have not been previously reported. Cultured skin fibroblasts exhibited the accumulation of vacuoles that is characteristic of PI(3,5)P2 deficiency. Vacuolization of fibroblasts was rescued by transfection of wild-type VAC14 cDNA. The similar age of onset and neurological decline in the two unrelated children define a recessive disorder resulting from compound heterozygosity for deleterious variants of VAC14.\n",
      "Contiguous ABCD1 DXS1357E deletion syndrome (CADDS) is a contiguous deletion syndrome involving the ABCD1 and DXS1357E/BAP31 genes on Xq28. Although ABCD1 is responsible for X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD), its phenotype differs from that of CADDS, which manifests with many features of Zellweger syndrome (ZS), including severe growth and developmental retardation, liver dysfunction, cholestasis and early infantile death. We report here the fourth case of CADDS, in which a boy had dysmorphic features, including a flat orbital edge, hypoplastic nose, micrognathia, inguinal hernia, micropenis, cryptorchidism and club feet, all of which are shared by ZS. The patient achieved no developmental milestones and died of pneumonia at 8 months. Biochemical studies demonstrated abnormal metabolism of very long chain fatty acids, which was higher than that seen in X-ALD. Immunocytochemistry and Western blot showed the absence of ALD protein (ALDP) despite the presence of other peroxisomal proteins. Pathological studies disclosed a small brain with hypomyelination and secondary hypoxic-ischemic changes. Neuronal heterotopia in the white matter and leptomeningeal glioneuronal heterotopia indicated a neuronal migration disorder. The liver showed fibrosis and cholestasis. The thymus and adrenal glands were hypoplastic. Array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) analysis suggested that the deletion was a genomic rearrangement in the 90-kb span starting in DXS1357E/BACP31 exon 4 and included ABCD1, PLXNB3, SRPK3, IDH3G and SSR4, ending in PDZD4 exon 8. Thus, the absence of ALDP, when combined with defects in the B-cell antigen receptor associated protein 31 (BAP31) and other factors, severely affects VLCFA metabolism on peroxisomal functions and produces ZS-like pathology.\n",
      "Characterization of the genetic defects causing gonadotropic deficiency has made a major contribution to elucidation of the fundamental role of Kisspeptins and Neurokinin B in puberty onset and reproduction. The absence of puberty may also reveal neurodevelopmental disorders caused by molecular defects in various cellular pathways. Investigations of these neurodevelopmental disorders may provide information about the neuronal processes controlling puberty onset and reproductive capacity. We describe here a new syndrome observed in three brothers, which involves gonadotropic axis deficiency, central hypothyroidism, peripheral demyelinating sensorimotor polyneuropathy, mental retardation, and profound hypoglycemia, progressing to nonautoimmune insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. High-throughput sequencing revealed a homozygous in-frame deletion of 15 nucleotides in DMXL2 in all three affected patients. This homozygous deletion was associated with lower DMXL2 mRNA levels in the blood lymphocytes of the patients. DMXL2 encodes the synaptic protein rabconnectin-3Œ±, which has been identified as a putative scaffold protein for Rab3-GAP and Rab3-GEP, two regulators of the GTPase Rab3a. We found that rabconnectin-3Œ± was expressed in exocytosis vesicles in gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) axonal extremities in the median eminence of the hypothalamus. It was also specifically expressed in cells expressing luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) within the pituitary. The conditional heterozygous deletion of Dmxl2 from mouse neurons delayed puberty and resulted in very low fertility. This reproductive phenotype was associated with a lower number of GnRH neurons in the hypothalamus of adult mice. Finally, Dmxl2 knockdown in an insulin-secreting cell line showed that rabconnectin-3Œ± controlled the constitutive and glucose-induced secretion of insulin. In conclusion, this study shows that low levels of DMXL2 expression cause a complex neurological phenotype, with abnormal glucose metabolism and gonadotropic axis deficiency due to a loss of GnRH neurons. Our findings identify rabconectin-3Œ± as a key controller of neuronal and endocrine homeostatic processes.\n",
      "Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) type VIII (periodontitis type) is a distinct form of EDS characterized by periodontal disease leading to precocious dental loss and a spectrum of joint and skin manifestations. EDS type VIII is transmitted in an autosomal dominant pattern; however, the mutated gene has not been identified. There are insufficient data on the spectrum of clinical manifestations and natural history of the disorder, and only a limited number of patients and pedigrees with this condition have been reported. We present a four-generation EDS type VIII kindred and show that EDS VIII is clinically variable and although some cases lack the associated skin and joint manifestations, microscopic evidence of collagen disorganization is detectable.We further propose that the diagnosis of EDS type VIII should be considered in familial forms of periodontitis, even when the associated skin and joint manifestations are unconvincing for the diagnosis of a connective tissue disorder. This novel observation highlights the uncertainty of using connective tissue signs in clinical practice to diagnose EDS type VIII.\n",
      "We describe a 3-year-old boy and his 2 maternal uncles with moderate to severe mental retardation, short stature, mild obesity, hypogonadism, a low total finger ridge count, and a distinctive face characterized by bitemporal narrowness, almond-shaped palperbral fissures, depressed nasal bridge, anteverted nares, short and inverted-V-shaped upper lip, and macrostomia. Two other males in this family who had similar facial anomalies and developmental delay died in early infancy and midchildhood. This apparently new disorder is reminiscent of, but distinct from, the Prader-Willi syndrome, and is likely inherited as an X-linked recessive trait. Preliminary studies with DNA probes are consistent with an X-linked locus and permit exclusion of distal Xp and Xq regions as the site of this mutation.\n",
      "Lysyl hydroxylase 3 (LH3, encoded by PLOD3) is a multifunctional enzyme capable of catalyzing hydroxylation of lysyl residues and O-glycosylation of hydroxylysyl residues producing either monosaccharide (Gal) or disaccharide (Glc-Gal) derivatives, reactions that form part of the many posttranslational modifications required during collagen biosynthesis. Animal studies have confirmed the importance of LH3, particularly in biosynthesis of the highly glycosylated type IV and VI collagens, but to date, the functional significance in vivo of this enzyme in man is predominantly unknown. We report here a human disorder of LH3 presenting as a compound heterozygote with recessive inheritance. One mutation dramatically reduced the sugar-transfer activity of LH3, whereas another abrogated lysyl hydroxylase activity; these changes were accompanied by reduced LH3 protein levels in cells. The disorder has a unique phenotype causing severe morbidity as a result of features that overlap with a number of known collagen disorders.\n",
      "In this report we describe a distinct and apparently new mental retardation syndrome in four siblings: three brothers and one sister.

      "We report a case of Wildervanck syndrome exhibiting Klippel-Feil anomaly, Duane retraction syndrome and deafness. Since the first case was reported in 1952, there have been more reports describing this triad, either complete or incomplete. Our patient had the complete triad of the syndrome along with cleft palate and short stature. Also, a review of the literature regarding this syndrome is presented here.\n",
      "The serotonin receptor 1A (encoded by the HTR1A gene) plays a critical role in serotonergic transmission and was linked with many human diseases. A 33-year-old woman with rare menstrual cycle-dependent fever showed abnormal estrogen profile and responded well to the HTR1A agonist buspirone, suggesting that her fevers were allied to estrogen-related HTR1A deficiency. We identified an adenine deletion 480-bases upstream of the translation start site (i.e., -480delA) of HTR1A in this patient. To determine the underlying mechanism of -480delA-mediated HTR1A deficiency, we first showed that HTR1A -480 region can be bound by multiple nuclear protein(s). We then identified poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP1) as one of the proteins that binds to HTR1A -480 region. Using PARP1 overexpression and knockdown, our data demonstrated that PARP1 represses HTR1A transcription. Furthermore, HTR1A -480delA promoter possesses increased interaction with PARP1 and caused an additional reduction in transcription. Finally, 17√é¬≤-estradiol administration further reduced transcription associated with the mutant promoter. Altogether, these data suggest that estrogen-induced hyperactivity of HTR1A mutant promoter causes the reduction of HTR1A mRNA and leads to the disruption of HTR1A-mediate hypothermic regulation. This is the first report of HTR1A mutation underlying menstrual cycle-dependent febrile episodes, and implies that similar \"febrile episode\" cases may also result from the dysfunction of serotonin transmission.\n",
      "An unusual case of a female infant with Catel-Manzke syndrome is presented. Additional features not previously reported include three accessory ossicles at the bases or associated with the proximal phalanx of the index, middle, ring and little fingers bilaterally. There are also numerous bony abnormalities in both feet. Previous cases have shown no more than 2 accessory ossicles in the hand and these usually involve the index alone. The foot abnormalities are more extensive than any previously seen in this syndrome. This is only the 8th female case out of a total of 27 reported cases.\n",
      "In 1969, Herrmann and Opitz described a syndrome of acrocephaly, oligosyndactyly, hypertelorism, and mental retardation. We report on a second case, a fetus with cleft palate, urethral astresia, oligohydramnios, and intrauterine death.\n",
      "We report a 54-year-old male, with a 5-year history of spreading asymptomatic generalized cutaneous telangiectases. The patient had no mucosal or nail involvement, no positive family history and no clinical evidence of systemic disease or bleeding diathesis. Histologically, the superficial small dermal blood vessels were dilated and showed thickened walls with hyaline perivascular material, staining as collagen. The vessel walls were PAS and colloidal iron stain positive, and immuno-histochemically lacked actin staining. Collagen IV, fibronectin and laminin antibodies showed the material deposited around the basement membrane zone. Ultrastructurally, the vessels were post-capillary venules (PCV) and showed marked collagen deposition around the basal lamina. There were many abnormally banded widely spaced fibres with 100-150 nm periodicity (Luse bodies), in addition to regular banded collagen. Pericytes were sparse and lacked intracytoplasmic filaments, and few veil or fibroblastic cells were seen embedded within the collagen. We believe this is a form of cutaneous microangiopathy not previously described, with distinct morphology and unique ultrastructural features. It may be due to a genetic defect with erroneous production of disorganized collagen in the cutaneous microvasculature. Dermatologists and Dermatopathologists should be aware of this unusual cutaneous vasculopathy.\n",
      "A syndrome compatible with an X-linked trait is described, affecting four male cousins in three sibships. The body had skeletal anomalies, including short stature, ridging of the metopic suture, fusion of cervical vertebrae, thoracic hemivertebrae, scoliosis, sarcral hypoplasia and short middle phalanges. In addition, they had moderate developmental retardation, and abducens palsies. Three of the four had glucose intolerance, and one was born with an imperforate anus. Of five female obligate carriers studied, three had fusion of cervical vertebrae, three had some shortening of the middle phalanges and three had glucose intolerance. The syndrome in this family was compared to previously reported syndromes, and the conclusion was reached that it represents a previously unreported X-linked syndrome with minor manifestations in carrier females.\n",
      "Frank-Ter Haar syndrome is an unusual type of skeletal dysplasia with megalocornea and developmental delay. It is usually transmitted as autosomal recessive disorder. Only a few cases have been reported in the literature and none from India. The authors report a case with other unusual features and a short review of the condition.\n",
      "Palmoplantar keratodermas (PPK) encompass a large genetically heterogeneous group of diseases associated with hyperkeratosis of the soles and/or palms that occur either isolated or in association with other cutaneous and extracutaneous manifestations. Pathogenic mutations in the desmoglein 1 gene (DSG1) have recently been identified in a subset of patients with the striate type of PPK.We have identified a patient with a focal non-striated form of PPK associated with discrete troubles of keratinisation at sites exposed to mechanical trauma, such as the knees, ankles or finger knuckles, and with mild nail dystrophy. Genetic analyses disclosed a novel dominantly inherited heterozygous single base insertion in exon 3 of DSG1, 121insT, leading to a premature termination codon. The mutation was also present in the father and in a sister.Our observation extends the spectrum of clinical features associated with genetic defects in DSG1 and provides further evidence that perturbation of desmoglein 1 expression has a critical impact on the integrity of tissues experiencing strong mechanical stress.\n",
      "Congenital diarrheal disorders consist of a variety of chronic enteropathies. There are approximately 30 different diseases that can be classified into four groups according to the mechanisms involved in pathogenesis: (i) absorption and transport of nutrients and electrolytes; (ii) enterocyte differentiation and polarization; (iii) enteroendocrine cell differentiation; and (iv) modulation of the intestinal immune response. Affected patients often present with life-threatening diarrhea, in the first few weeks of life. A new disorder, enteric anendocrinosis, which is characterized by severe malabsorptive diarrhea and a lack of intestinal enteroendocrine cells has recently been described in six patients with recessively inherited mutations in the Neurogenin-3 gene. In this report we describe a seventh case with a review of the literature.\n",
      "We describe a family with a new disorder characterized by congenital hypotrichosis and spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia that results in mild rhizomelic short stature. Five individuals in 3 generations are affected with autosomal dominant inheritance.\n",
      "Three siblings with retinitis pigmentosa, deafness and mental retardation were studied. Physical abnormalities included nystagmus, acanthosis nigricans and multiple keloids. The two male siblings had gynecomastia, small testes and mild subvirilization whereas the only indication of hypogonadism in the female sibling was oligomenorrhea. Testosterone levels in the males, which were in the low to low normal range, were increased by the administration of large doses of chorionic gonadotropin. The two affected males had elevated plasma luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels which were decreased by the administration of testosterone and increased by the administration of clomiphene. One sibling had mild obesity and diabetes mellitus, one had moderate obesity, normal glucose tolerance and hyperinsulinism and the third had abnormal glucose tolerance and hyperinsulinism. This familial syndrome is distinct from either the Laurence-Moon, Bardet-Biedl or Alstr√É¬∂m disorders and provides further evidence of genetic heterogeneity in this group of autosomal recessive traits.\n",
      "We describe a mother and her three daughters who all have bilateral congenital dislocation of the hip. The mother has had no other medical problems and is on the 90th centile for height. Her three daughters resemble each other strongly with facial characteristics which include hypertelorism, epicanthic folds, puffiness around the eyes, a flat mid-face and a carp-shaped mouth. All three daughters are on the 3rd centile for height, with their head circumference on a higher centile and all had an ASD. Other features include congenital dislocation of one knee (one), congenital inguinal hernia (one) and vesico-ureteric reflux (one). They also have clinodactyly and hyperextensible finger joints, both features also seen in their father, whose height is on the 3rd centile and who had bilateral congenital inguinal herniae. Collagen studies of skin and ligament were normal. This family does not appear to fit with any of the recognized congenital dislocation syndromes and we suggest that they may represent a previously undescribed syndrome.\n",
      "The phenotype of mosaic variegated aneuploidy (MVA) syndrome is characterized by severe microcephaly, growth deficiency, mental retardation, and mild physical anomalies. The MVA syndrome is associated with mosaicism for several different aneuploidies involving many different chromosomes with or without premature centromere division (PCD). To date 28 cases of MVA syndrome have been reported. We report the first case of MVA syndrome without microcephaly. The clinical features in our patient included craniofacial dysmorphic features, growth retardation, and developmental delay. Cytogenetics analyses and FISH studies showed multiple aneuploidy with trisomy 18, 19, and 8, respectively in blood lymphocyte and fibroblasts without PCD. This case is compared with the other of MVA syndrome previously reported in literature. From this case report, we suggest that microcephaly is not mandatory for the diagnosis of MVA syndrome.\n",
      "Perilipin is the most abundant adipocyte-specific protein that coats lipid droplets, and it is required for optimal lipid incorporation and release from the droplet. We identified two heterozygous frameshift mutations in the perilipin gene (PLIN1) in three families with partial lipodystrophy, severe dyslipidemia, and insulin-resistant diabetes. Subcutaneous fat from the patients was characterized by smaller-than-normal adipocytes, macrophage infiltration, and fibrosis. In contrast to wild-type perilipin, mutant forms of the protein failed to increase triglyceride accumulation when expressed heterologously in preadipocytes. These findings define a novel dominant form of inherited lipodystrophy and highlight the serious metabolic consequences of a primary defect in the formation of lipid droplets in adipose tissue.\n",
      "Inherited peripheral neuropathies are a heterogeneous group of disorders that can affect patients of all ages. Children with inherited neuropathy often develop severe disability, but the genetic causes of recessive early-onset axonal neuropathies are not fully known. We have taken a whole-exome sequencing approach to identify causative disease mutations in single patients with early-onset axonal neuropathy. Here, we report compound heterozygous mutations in the tripartite motif containing 2 (TRIM2) gene in a patient with childhood-onset axonal neuropathy, low weight and small muscle mass. We show that the patient fibroblasts are practically devoid of TRIM2, through mRNA and protein instability caused by the mutations. TRIM2 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that ubiquitinates neurofilament light chain, a component of the intermediate filament in axons. Resembling the findings in our patient's sural nerve biopsy, Trim2-gene trap mice showed axonopathy with accumulations of neurofilaments inside axons. Our results suggest that loss-of-function mutations in TRIM2 are a cause of axonal neuropathy, which we propose to develop as a consequence of axonal accumulation of neurofilaments, secondary to lack of its ubiquitination by TRIM2.\n",
      "We describe two Finnish brothers with frontotemporal pachygyria, intellectual deficiency and mild dysmorphisms. Previously, only a few cases of similar frontotemporal pachygyria have been reported. This report provides further evidence about frontotemporal pachygyria being a distinct genetic entity inherited as an autosomal recessive trait.\n",
      "STUDY OBJECTIVES: Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia, deafness and narcolepsy (ADCA-DN) is caused by DNMT1 mutations. Diagnosing the syndrome can be difficult, as all clinical features may not be present at onset, HLA-DQB1*06:02 is often negative, and sporadic cases occur. We report on clinical and genetic findings in a 31-year-old woman with cerebellar ataxia, deafness, and narcolepsy, and discuss diagnostic challenges. DESIGN: Clinical and genetic investigation in a patient and family members. SETTING: Ataxia clinic, S√£o Paulo, Brazil. PATIENTS OR PARTICIPANTS: One patient and her family members. INTERVENTIONS: N/A. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Narcolepsy was supported by polysomnographic and multiple sleep latency testing. HLA-DQB1*06:02 was positive. CSF hypocretin-1 was 191 pg/mL (normal values > 200 pg/mL). Mild brain atrophy was observed on MRI, with cerebellar involvement. The patient, her asymptomatic mother, and 3 siblings gave blood samples for genetic analysis. DNMT1 exons 20 and 21 were sequenced. Haplotyping of polymorphic markers surrounding the mutation was performed. The proband had a novel DNMT1 mutation in exon 21, p.Cys596Arg, c.1786T > C. All 4 parental haplotypes could be characterized in asymptomatic siblings without the mutation, indicating that the mutation is de novo in the patient. CONCLUSIONS: The Brazilian patient reported here further adds to the worldwide distribution of ADCA-DN. The mutation is novel, and illustrates a sporadic case with de novo mutation. We believe that many more cases with this syndrome are likely to be diagnosed in the near future, mandating knowledge of this condition and consideration of the diagnosis.\n",
      "We report a new neurocutaneous syndrome of apparent autosomal recessive inheritance consisting of early-childhood-onset palmoplantar keratoderma followed in adulthood by progressive tetrapyramidal syndrome and cognitive impairment. Of the four affected siblings, two were available for evaluation. Investigation disclosed cerebral white-matter involvement on MRI and arylsulfatase A pseudodeficiency carrier state, which was also identified in clinically unaffected family members. Since skin biopsies showed dermal connective tissue abnormalities, we studied collagens I, III, and VI biosynthesis. Northern blotting of RNA extracted from cultured skin fibroblasts revealed an increased steady-state messenger RNA (mRNA) level of alpha 1(VI) collagen, whereas no differences were detected for pro alpha 1(I), pro alpha 1(III), and tropoelastin mRNAs. The skin content of collagen and total protein was higher in the patients than in controls. We suggest that an extracellular matrix abnormality may be involved in the pathogenesis of this disorder.\n",
      "Mutations in Bcl-2 associated athanogene-3 (BAG3) are a rare cause of myofibrillar myopathy, characterised by rapidly progressive proximal and axial myopathy, cardiomyopathy and respiratory compromise. Neuropathy has been documented neurophysiologically in previously reported cases of BAG3-associated myofibrillar myopathy and in some cases giant axons were observed on nerve biopsies; however, neuropathy was not thought to be a dominant feature of the disease. In the context of inherited neuropathy, giant axons are typically associated with autosomal recessive giant axonal neuropathy caused by gigaxonin mutations but have also been reported in association with NEFL- and SH3TC2-associated Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. Here, we describe four patients with heterozygous BAG3 mutations with clinical evidence of a sensorimotor neuropathy, with predominantly axonal features on neurophysiology. Three patients presented with a significant neuropathy. Muscle magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in one patient revealed mild to moderate atrophy without prominent selectivity. Examination of sural nerve biopsies in two patients demonstrated giant axons. This report confirms the association of giant axonal neuropathy with BAG3-associated myofibrillar myopathy, and highlights that neuropathy may be a significant feature.\n",
      "Two brothers with severe and rare lower limb malformations but normal upper limbs are described. Both brothers had glans hypospadias and they died in early infancy. In the first brother the limb malformation was a severe deformity of the right foot which was split and of rockerbottom shape with oligosyndactyly. In the second brother the right limb below the knee was more severely deformed while only the toes were involved in the left limb. Details of the clinical and pathological findings are described. The most likely mode of inheritance of this rare syndrome is autosomal recessive or X-linked recessive with variable expressivity.\n",
      "We present monozygotic twin boys of a triplet pregnancy with phalangeal abnormalities, deafness, a caudal appendage and the additional features of short stature, cryptorchidism, mental retardation and facial dysmorphism.\n",
      "In mitochondria, carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase 1 activity produces carbamoyl phosphate for urea synthesis, and deficiency results in hyperammonemia. Cytoplasmic carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase 2, however, is part of a tri-functional enzyme encoded by CAD; no human disease has been attributed to this gene. The tri-functional enzyme contains carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase 2 (CPS2), aspartate transcarbamylase (ATCase) and dihydroorotase (DHOase) activities, which comprise the first three of six reactions required for de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis. Here we characterize an individual who is compound heterozygous for mutations in different domains of CAD. One mutation, c.1843-1G>A, results in an in-frame deletion of exon 13. The other, c.6071G>A, causes a missense mutation (p.Arg2024Gln) in a highly conserved residue that is essential for carbamoyl-phosphate binding. Metabolic flux studies showed impaired aspartate incorporation into RNA and DNA through the de novo synthesis pathway. In addition, CTP, UTP and nearly all UDP-activated sugars that serve as donors for glycosylation were decreased. Uridine supplementation rescued these abnormalities, suggesting a potential therapy for this new glycosylation disorder.\n",
      "Lissencephaly is characterized by deficient cortical lamination. Recently homozygous NDE1 mutations were reported in three kindred afflicted with extreme microcephaly with lissencephaly or microlissencephaly. Another severe developmental defect that involves the brain is microhydranencephaly which manifests with microcephaly, motor and mental retardation and brain malformations that include gross dilation of the ventricles with complete absence of the cerebral hemispheres or severe delay in their development. In the three related patients with microhydranencephaly that we had reported previously, we identified a homozygous deletion that encompasses NDE1 exon 2 containing the initiation codon. The mutation is predicted to result in a null allele. Herein we compare the clinical phenotypes of our research patients to those reported as microlissencephaly. The clinical findings in our patients having the fourth NDE1 mutation reported so far widen the spectrum of brain malformations resulting from mutations in NDE1.\n",
      "Two siblings of Italian origin with mild chronic haemolytic anaemia, psychomotor impairment and undetectable adenylate kinase (AK) activity are reported. The other red cell enzyme activities were normal except for a slight decrease of PFK. 2,3-DPG levels were increased in both siblings, and AMP decreased in one only. The parents were not consanguineous and displayed intermediate AK activity. The sequence of complete erythrocyte AK-1 cDNA showed the presence of a nonsense homozygous mutation at codon 107 (CGA --> TGA, Arg --> Stop) in the siblings. The mutation results in a truncated protein of 107 amino acids in comparison with the 194 of the normal one. Moreover a 37 bp deletion in the first part of exon 6 (from nt 326 to nt 362 of the cDNA sequence) was detected in one allele; this deletion is not likely to further affect the enzyme structure, being localized after the stop codon. The new variant was named AK Fidenza, from the origin of the patients.\n",
      "Boomerang dysplasia (BD) is a perinatal lethal osteochondrodysplasia, characterised by absence or underossification of the limb bones and vertebrae. The BD phenotype is similar to a group of disorders including atelosteogenesis I, atelosteogenesis III, and dominantly inherited Larsen syndrome that we have recently shown to be associated with mutations in FLNB, the gene encoding the actin binding cytoskeletal protein, filamin B. We report the identification of mutations in FLNB in two unrelated individuals with boomerang dysplasia. The resultant substitutions, L171R and S235P, lie within the calponin homology 2 region of the actin binding domain of filamin B and occur at sites that are evolutionarily well conserved. These findings expand the phenotypic spectrum resulting from mutations in FLNB and underline the central role this protein plays during skeletogenesis in humans.\n",
      "We describe two brothers with a unique pattern of malformations that includes coloboma (iris, optic nerve), high forehead, severe retrognathia, mental retardation, and agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC). Both boys have low-set cupped ears with sensorineural hearing loss, normal phallus, pectus excavatum, scoliosis, and short stature. One brother had choanal atresia and cardiac defects consisting of ventricular septal defect (VSD) and patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) which resolved spontaneously. Differential diagnosis between a number of clinical entities was considered, however, because ACC and the distinctive facial features were reminiscent of FG syndrome, DNA was analyzed for markers linked to the FGS1 locus at Xq13-q21. Notably, the brothers were concordant for markers spanning this presumed FG region, and in both we have identified adjacent alterations (-57delT and T-55A) in the Alpha 4 gene located within this interval. Alpha 4 is a regulatory subunit of the major cellular phosphatase, PP2A, that has recently been shown to interact with MID1, the product of the gene mutated in X-linked Opitz GBBB syndrome. The double nucleotide change identified in this family was not observed in 410 control chromosomes, suggesting that it may be a pathogenetic change. Altered expression of Alpha 4, through either a change in translational efficiency, mRNA stability or splicing, could explain the clinical phenotype in these boys and the phenotypic overlap with Opitz GBBB syndrome.\n",
      "OBJECTIVES: Neonatal antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is rare and only few cases have been reported, most of them describing trans-placental passage of penetrable maternal antibodies. The current article aims at defining the clinical and biochemical features of the de novo occurrence of neonatal APS and considerations for long-term treatment. METHODS: We present a case and review the medical literature using PubMed. RESULTS: Including the current report, there are 11 reports of de novo neonatal APS. These include 8 cases of acute ischemic stroke, 2 of venous thrombosis, and 1 of mixed arterial and venous thrombosis. All cases had an additional thrombotic risk factor, either inherited or acquired. Negative maternal history together with low clinical suspicion led to late diagnosis in most cases. In all cases aPL antibodies persisted in the serum throughout the follow-up period. No recurrence of thrombotic events was reported in patients under long-term anticoagulation with either low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or aspirin. There is 1 report of recurrent thrombosis where the patient did not receive anticoagulation. In this case diagnosis was made only retrospectively after recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend that de novo APS be considered in all cases of unexplained neonatal thrombosis aiming at early diagnosis and implementation of long-term anticoagulation to prevent recurrent thrombotic events.\n",
      "BACKGROUND:King syndrome is characterized by the presence of a nonspecific myopathy, a susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia, and dysmorphic features similar to the phenotype seen in Noonan syndrome. CASE:A young primigravida with King syndrome presented at 19 weeks' gestation. The patient required nocturnal mechanical ventilation via tracheostomy, and there was concern that the patient would become increasingly dependent on mechanical ventilation during pregnancy. The patient underwent a forceps-assisted delivery at 35 weeks' gestation, and both the patient and her infant did well and were discharged on postpartum day 3. CONCLUSION:In the gravida with King syndrome, agents that may trigger malignant hyperthermia should be avoided. Significant myopathy may result in respiratory compromise, and a multidisciplinary approach is necessary to optimize maternal and fetal outcome.\n",
      "Two sisters and their mother had a syndrome of microcephaly, cleft palate, and variable anomalies such as unusual facial appearance, hypotelorism, abnormal retinal pigmentation, maxillary hypoplasia, goiter, camptodactyly, mild mental retardation, and abnormal dermatoglyphics. This is an evidently dominantly inherited trait, either autosomal or X-linked.\n",
      "We report on 2 male propositi, their mothers, and a maternal aunt with a new skeletal dysplasia associated with a unique pattern of digital malformation, variable mild short stature, and mild bowleg with proximal overgrowth of the fibula. The digital malformations comprise a pattern of brachydactyly which includes short, abducted thumbs, short index fingers, and markedly short, abducted great toes. The radiographic findings include hypoplastic thumbs and great toes with short first metacarpals and first metatarsals, absent distal phalanges of the index fingers and second toes, and coalescence of the carpal and tarsal bones. Radiographs of the long bones show mild metaphyseal and epiphyseal irregularity, tibial spurs, and relative elongation of the fibulae. The males are very similarly affected whereas the females show phenotypic variation and are generally less severely affected. The family histories from 2 fairly extensive pedigrees suggest X-linked dominant inheritance.\n",
      "Congenital malformations involving the eyebrows are a rare phenomenon. Recently we have seen a case with partial duplication of the eyebrows and multiple other malformations. Because of the presence of close parental consanguinity, we believe this constellation of findings represents a new syndrome, possibly transmitted as an autosomal recessive disorder.\n",
      "We report on three males with de novo overlapping 7.5, 9.8, and 10 Mb duplication of chromosome 20q11.2. Together with another patient previously published in the literature with overlapping 20q11 microduplication, we show that such patients display common clinical features including metopic ridging/trigonocephaly, developmental delay, epicanthal folds, and short hands. The duplication comprised the ASXL1 gene, in which de novo heterozygous nonsense or truncating mutations have recently been reported in patients with Borhing-Opitz syndrome. Because of craniofacial features in common with Borhing-Opitz syndrome, in particular metopic ridging/trigonocephaly, we suggest that duplication of ASXL1 contributes to the phenotype. These observations suggest a novel microduplication syndrome, and reporting of additional patients with molecular characterization will allow more detailed genotype-phenotype correlations.\n"

      "We describe 3 unrelated newborn males with a previously unreported constellation of congenital anomalies. All 3 died neonatally of hepatic failure. Clinically, they presented with a pattern of malformations characterized by prenatal linear growth deficiency, hypertrophied alveolar ridges, redundant nuchal skin, and postaxial polydactyly. All 3 cases had male external genitalia with cryptorchidism, and 2 of them, a small penis. Necropsies showed similar internal anomalies, consisting of m√ºllerian duct remnants, lymphangiectasis, and renal anomalies. The karyotypes were normal (46, XY) in skin fibroblasts (Case 1) and in peripheral blood lymphocytes (Case 3). Although this pattern of congenital anomalies must be differentiated from several other lethal syndromes, to our knowledge, no similar cases have been described previously. Cause of this syndrome is unknown. Because Case 2 had a previous brother with similar anomalies, we suspect that this new entity probably is an autosomal recessive or X-linked trait.\n",

      "Str√∏mme syndrome was first described by Str√∏mme et al. (1993) in siblings presenting with \"apple peel\" type intestinal atresia, ocular anomalies and microcephaly. The etiology remains unknown to date. We describe the long-term clinical follow-up data for the original pair of siblings as well as two previously unreported siblings with a severe phenotype overlapping that of the Str√∏mme syndrome including fetal autopsy results. Using family-based whole-exome sequencing, we identified truncating mutations in the centrosome gene CENPF in the two nonconsanguineous Caucasian sibling pairs. Compound heterozygous inheritance was confirmed in both families. Recently, mutations in this gene were shown to cause a fetal lethal phenotype, the phenotype and functional data being compatible with a human ciliopathy [Waters et al., 2015]. We show for the first time that Str√∏mme syndrome is an autosomal-recessive disease caused by mutations in CENPF that can result in a wide phenotypic spectrum.\n",

      "Upon detection of pathogen-associated molecular patterns, innate immune receptors initiate inflammatory responses. These receptors include cytoplasmic NOD-like receptors (NLRs) whose stimulation recruits and proteolytically activates caspase-1 within the inflammasome, a multiprotein complex. Caspase-1 mediates the production of interleukin-1 family cytokines (IL1FCs), leading to fever and inflammatory cell death (pyroptosis). Mutations that constitutively activate these pathways underlie several autoinflammatory diseases with diverse clinical features. We describe a family with a previously unreported syndrome featuring neonatal-onset enterocolitis, periodic fever, and fatal or near-fatal episodes of autoinflammation. We show that the disease is caused by a de novo gain-of-function mutation in NLRC4 encoding a p.Val341Ala substitution in the HD1 domain of the protein that cosegregates with disease. Mutant NLRC4 causes constitutive IL1FC production and macrophage cell death. Infected macrophages from affected individuals are polarized toward pyroptosis and exhibit abnormal staining for inflammasome components. These findings identify and describe the cause of a life-threatening but treatable autoinflammatory disease that underscores the divergent roles of the NLRC4 inflammasome.\n",

Congenital heart disease was present in four BSAS patients, two of whom had neither deafness nor horizontal gaze restriction, thus raising the possibility that cardiovascular malformations might be a clinically isolated, or relatively isolated, manifestation of homozygous HOXA1 mutations. Two ABDS probands had relatively mild mental retardation. These individuals blur the clinical distinctions between the BSAS and ABDS HOXA1 variants and broaden the phenotype and genotype of the homozygous HOXA1 mutation clinical spectrum.\n",

      "Acral peeling skin syndrome (APSS) is an autosomal recessive skin disorder characterized by acral blistering and peeling of the outermost layers of the epidermis. It is caused by mutations in the gene for transglutaminase 5, TGM5. Here, we report on clinical and molecular findings in 11 patients and extend the TGM5 mutation database by four, to our knowledge, previously unreported mutations: p.M1T, p.L41P, p.L214CfsX15, and p.S604IfsX9. The recurrent mutation p.G113C was found in 9 patients, but also in 3 of 100 control individuals in a heterozygous state, indicating that APSS might be more widespread than hitherto expected. Using quantitative real-time PCR, immunoblotting, and immunofluorescence analysis, we demonstrate that expression and distribution of several epidermal differentiation markers and corneodesmosin (CDSN) is altered in APSS keratinocytes and skin. Although the expression of transglutaminases 1 and 3 was not changed, we found an upregulation of keratin 1, keratin 10, involucrin, loricrin, and CDSN, probably as compensatory mechanisms for stabilization of the epidermal barrier. Our results give insights into the consequences of TGM5 mutations on terminal epidermal differentiation.\n",

Most clinical manifestations were evident neonatally, but skeletal changes and cataracts became substantial in early childhood. Radiological anomalies comprised coronal synostosis, mild epiphyseal dysplasia, particularly in the distal tibiae, strikingly delayed patellar ossification, mild metaphyseal splaying, hypoplastic ilia with iliac flare, and platyspondyly with ovoid-shaped or posteriorly humped vertebral bodies. The nonconsanguineous parents were mildly mentally retarded, and sibs of both gender were equally affected; thus, inheritance was likely autosomal recessive.\n",

      "We describe a syndrome identified in three consanguineous families who had two and probably four common ancestors five generations ago. The syndrome is characterized by profound dysfunction of the central nervous system, silver-leaden colored hair, abnormal melanosomes and melanocytes, and abnormal inclusion bodies in fibroblasts, bone marrow histiocytes and lymphocytes which appear to represent abnormal lysosomal bodies. Because of the biochemical relationships between melanin-melanosomes and neuromelanin, we think that all the manifestations of the condition are related to and represent pleiotropic effects of a newly identified gene in man in its homozygous state. Biochemical reactions of the cells of these patients indicate presence of tyrosinase in the melanosomes.and show that the substance accumulated in cultured fibroblasts and in the bone marrow histiocytes is a PAS and Oil-red-O positive material but is Oil-red-O negative after extraction; it has the typical reactions of melanin withe the Masson and Fontana stain, but cannot be considered typical melanin, since without stain it is colorless. The ultrastructural studies showed round granules with variable matrix, similar in fibroblast and bone marrow, and with variable intensity of reaction to osmium. This mutation principally affects the neuroectoderm, but also the mesoderm.\n",

      "The objective of this study was to identify new causes of Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease in patients with autosomal-recessive (AR) CMT.To efficiently identify novel causative genes for AR-CMT, we analyzed 303 unrelated Japanese patients with CMT using whole-exome sequencing and extracted recessive variants/genes shared among multiple patients. We performed mutation screening of the newly identified membrane metalloendopeptidase (MME) gene in 354 additional patients with CMT. We clinically, genetically, pathologically, and radiologically examined 10 patients with the MME mutation.We identified recessive mutations in MME in 10 patients. The MME gene encodes neprilysin (NEP), which is well known to be one of the most prominent beta-amyloid (AŒ≤)-degrading enzymes. All patients had a similar phenotype consistent with late-onset axonal neuropathy. They showed muscle weakness, atrophy, and sensory disturbance in the lower extremities. All the MME mutations could be loss-of-function mutations, and we confirmed a lack/decrease of NEP protein expression in a peripheral nerve. No patients showed symptoms of dementia, and 1 patient showed no excess AŒ≤ in Pittsburgh compound-B positron emission tomography imaging.Our results indicate that loss-of-function MME mutations are the most frequent cause of adult-onset AR-CMT2 in Japan, and we propose that this new disease should be termed AR-CMT2T. A loss-of-function MME mutation did not cause early-onset Alzheimer's disease. Identifying the MME mutation responsible for AR-CMT could improve the rate of molecular diagnosis and the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of CMT.\n",

      "Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (OMIM 270400) (SLOS) is caused by inherited enzymatic deficiency of 3beta-hydroxysterol-Delta7-reductase (7-dehydrocholesterol-Delta7-reductase, DHCR7). SLOS is diagnosed clinically by the demonstration of elevated levels of 7-dehydrocholesterol (7DHC) in body fluids or tissues. SLOS is associated with mental retardation of variable degree and severe behavior abnormalities. The physical abnormalities range from minor facial anomalies to lethal malformations of the central nervous system, heart, kidneys, and other organs. The exact incidence of SLOS is not known. Although there exist estimates of the incidence of SLOS ranging from 1 in 20,000 to 1 in 60,000, no prospective studies of the incidence of SLOS, based on the clinical data and biochemical diagnosis of SLOS, have been performed. Five unrelated cases of SLOS were diagnosed in Ontario during a 12-month period. The diagnoses were made based on the demonstration of elevated 7DHC in plasma or amniotic fluid. The birth rate for Ontario for that period was 132,000 births. The incidence of SLOS in Ontario was at least 1 in 26,500 pregnancies in 1999-2000. Given that 86% of the population of Ontario is of European origin, the incidence of SLOS in the Ontario population of European origin was at least 1 in 22,700. As infants with mild forms of SLOS born during this period may remain undiagnosed, these numbers likely are underestimates. This observation has implications for prenatal and newborn screening for this potentially treatable inherited disorder.\n",

      "Stratton and Parker [1989] described a 17-month-old boy with the previously unreported combination of growth hormone (GH) deficiency, Wormian bones, mild developmental delay, brachycamptodactyly, heart defects, kidney hypoplasia, imperforate anus, bilateral cryptorchidism, and facial anomalies. A similar case was later reported by Gabrielli et al. [1994], who suggested the existence of a \"Stratton-Parker syndrome.\" Here, we describe a boy with isolated GH deficiency, body asymmetry, and brachycamptodactyly. At birth, complete anorectal agenesis and cryptorchidism were detected, which required surgical treatment. Radiographic examination showed the presence of bilateral proximal radioulnar subluxation and Kirner anomaly. Brain MRI showed asymmetry of the posterior horns of the lateral ventricles and enlarged cisterna magna. Psychomotor development had been mildly delayed during the first years of life. Due to the unique association of GH deficiency with intestinal, genital, and limbs abnormalities, we believe that our patient may represent a further case of Stratton-Parker syndrome. All patients reported, till date, are sporadic males born to healthy nonconsanguineous parents. X-linked recessive inheritance is a possibility to consider.\n",

      "We report heterozygous, loss-of-function SOX2 mutations in three unrelated individuals with Anophthalmia-Esophageal-Genital (AEG) syndrome. One previously reported case [Rogers, R.C. (1988) Unknown cases. Proceedings of the Greenwood Genetic Center. 7, 57.] has a 2.7 Mb deletion encompassing SOX2 and associated with a cryptic translocation t(3;7)(q28;p21.3). The deletion and translocation breakpoints on chromosome 3q are >8.6 Mb apart and both chromosome rearrangements have occurred de novo. Another published case [Petrackova et al. (2004) Association of oesophageal atresia, anophthalmia and renal duplex. Eur. J. Pediatr., 163, 333-334.] has a de novo nonsense mutation, Q55X. A previously unreported case with severe bilateral microphthalmia and oesophageal atresia has a de novo missense mutation, R74P, that alters a highly evolutionarily conserved residue within the high mobility group domain, which is critical for DNA-binding of SOX2. In a yeast one-hybrid assay, this mutation abolishes Sox2-induced activation of the chick delta-crystallin DC5 enhancer. Four other reported AEG syndrome cases were extensively screened and do not have detectable SOX2 mutations. Two of these cases have unilateral eye malformations. SOX2 mutations are known to cause severe bilateral eye malformations but this is the first report implicating loss of function mutations in this transcription factor in oesophageal malformations. SOX2 is expressed in the developing foregut in mouse and zebrafish embryos and an apparently normal pattern of expression is maintained in Shh-/- mouse embryos, suggesting either that Sox2 acts upstream of Shh or functions in a different pathway. Three-dimensional reconstructions of the major morphological events in the developing foregut and eye from Carnegie Stages 12 and 13 human embryos are presented and compared with the data from model organisms. SOX2, with NMYC and CHD7, is now the third transcriptional regulator known to be critical for normal oesophageal development in humans.\n",

      "X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) is a primary immunodeficiency caused by mutations in the gene for Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) that result in the deficient development of B lymphocytes and hypogammaglobulinemia. Because the disorder is uncommon, no single institution has had sufficient numbers of patients to develop a comprehensive clinical picture of the disorder. Accordingly, a national registry of United States residents with XLA was established in 1999 to provide an updated clinical view of the disorder in a large cohort of patients. A total of 201 patients were registered by 66 physicians. The estimated birth rate for the 10-year period of 1988-1997 was 1/379,000. Infection was the most common initial clinical presentation (85%), followed by a positive family history (41%) and neutropenia (11%). Although the average age of diagnosis was younger in patients with a positive family history (mean, 2.59 yr) than in patients with a negative family history (mean, 5.37 yr) (p < 0.001), only 34.5% of patients with a positive family history at the time of their birth were diagnosed before clinical symptoms developed-that is, based on family history alone. Seventy percent of patients had at least 1 episode of otitis, 62% at least 1 episode of pneumonia, 60% at least 1 episode of sinusitis, 23% at least 1 episode of chronic/recurrent diarrhea, 21% at least 1 episode of conjunctivitis, 18% at least 1 episode of pyoderma and/or cellulitis, 11% at least 1 episode of meningitis/encephalitis, 10% at least 1 episode of sepsis, 8% at least 1 episode of septic arthritis, 6% at least 1 episode of hepatitis, and 3% at least 1 episode of osteomyelitis. Fourteen of 201 (6.9%) patients were dead at the time they were entered in the Registry. However, in a prospective 4 /4-year follow-up of living patients, only 3/80 (3.75%) patients died. Causes of death included disseminated enterovirus infection (n = 6), pulmonary insufficiency (n = 5), adenovirus infection (n = 1), sepsis (n = 1), acquired immunodeficiency disease syndrome (AIDS) (n = 1), myocarditis (n = 1), hepatitis (n = 2), and stem cell transplantation (n = 1).\n",

      "Galloway-Mowat syndrome (GAMOS) is a phenotypically heterogeneous disorder characterized by neurodevelopmental defects combined with renal-glomerular disease, manifesting with proteinuria. To identify additional monogenic disease causes, we here performed whole exome sequencing (WES), linkage analysis, and homozygosity mapping in three affected siblings of an Indian family with GAMOS. Applying established criteria for variant filtering, we identify a novel homozygous splice site mutation in the gene WDR4 as the likely disease-causing mutation in this family. In line with previous reports, we observe growth deficiency, microcephaly, developmental delay, and intellectual disability as phenotypic features resulting from WDR4 mutations. However, the newly identified allele additionally gives rise to proteinuria and nephrotic syndrome, a phenotype that was never reported in patients with WDR4 mutations. Our data thus expand the phenotypic spectrum of WDR4 mutations by demonstrating that, depending on the specific mutated allele, a renal phenotype may be present. This finding suggests that GAMOS may occupy a phenotypic spectrum with other microcephalic diseases. Furthermore, WDR4 is an additional example of a gene that encodes a tRNA modifying enzyme and gives rise to GAMOS, if mutated. Our findings thereby support the recent observation that, like neurons, podocytes of the renal glomerulus are particularly vulnerable to cellular defects resulting from altered tRNA modifications.\n",

      "Mutations in nuclear genes required for the replication and maintenance of mitochondrial DNA cause progressive multisystemic neuromuscular disorders with overlapping phenotypes. Biallelic mutations in C10orf2, encoding the Twinkle mitochondrial DNA helicase, lead to infantile-onset cerebellar ataxia (IOSCA), as well as milder and more severe phenotypes. We present a 13-year-old girl with ataxia, severe hearing loss, optic atrophy, peripheral neuropathy, and hypergonadotropic hypogonadism. Whole-exome sequencing revealed that the patient is compound heterozygous for previously unreported variants in the C10orf2 gene: a paternally inherited frameshift variant (c.333delT; p.L112Sfs*3) and a maternally inherited missense variant (c.904C>T; p.R302W). The identification of novel C10orf2 mutations extends the spectrum of mutations in the Twinkle helicase causing recessive disease, in particular the intermediate IOSCA phenotype. Structural modeling suggests that the p.R302W mutation and many other recessively inherited Twinkle mutations impact the position or interactions of the linker region, which is critical for the oligomeric ring structure and activity of the helicase. This study emphasizes the utility of whole-exome sequencing for the genetic diagnosis of a complex multisystemic disorder.\n",

In the two families described, a more severe phenotype led to in utero lethality in three siblings while in a single patient in a second family the phenotype was sufficiently mild to allow survival to 5 months of age. The disorder is caused by biallelic missense mutations in CYP26B1, which encodes for a cytochrome P450 enzyme responsible for the catabolism of retinoic acid in a temporally and spatially restricted fashion during embryonic development. Here, we provide the third family affected by the disorder and the first affected individual to survive beyond infancy.

      "Variants in CLCN4, which encodes the chloride/hydrogen ion exchanger CIC-4 prominently expressed in brain, were recently described to cause X-linked intellectual disability and epilepsy. We present detailed phenotypic information on 52 individuals from 16 families with CLCN4-related disorder: 5 affected females and 2 affected males with a de novo variant in CLCN4 (6 individuals previously unreported) and 27 affected males, 3 affected females and 15 asymptomatic female carriers from 9 families with inherited CLCN4 variants (4 families previously unreported). Intellectual disability ranged from borderline to profound. Behavioral and psychiatric disorders were common in both child- and adulthood, and included autistic features, mood disorders, obsessive-compulsive behaviors and hetero- and autoaggression. Epilepsy was common, with severity ranging from epileptic encephalopathy to well-controlled seizures. Several affected individuals showed white matter changes on cerebral neuroimaging and progressive neurological symptoms, including movement disorders and spasticity. Heterozygous females can be as severely affected as males. The variability of symptoms in females is not correlated with the X inactivation pattern studied in their blood. The mutation spectrum includes frameshift, missense and splice site variants and one single-exon deletion. All missense variants were predicted to affect CLCN4's function based on in silico tools and either segregated with the phenotype in the family or were de novo. Pathogenicity of all previously unreported missense variants was further supported by electrophysiological studies in Xenopus laevis oocytes. We compare CLCN4-related disorder with conditions related to dysfunction of other members of the CLC family.\n",

      "Mutations in the nuclear-encoded mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are associated with a range of clinical phenotypes. Here, we report a novel disorder in three adult patients with a phenotype including cataracts, short-stature secondary to growth hormone deficiency, sensorineural hearing deficit, peripheral sensory neuropathy, and skeletal dysplasia. Using SNP genotyping and whole-exome sequencing, we identified a single likely causal variant, a missense mutation in a conserved residue of the nuclear gene IARS2, encoding mitochondrial isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase. The mutation is homozygous in the affected patients, heterozygous in carriers, and absent in control chromosomes. IARS2 protein level was reduced in skin cells cultured from one of the patients, consistent with a pathogenic effect of the mutation. Compound heterozygous mutations in IARS2 were independently identified in a previously unreported patient with a more severe mitochondrial phenotype diagnosed as Leigh syndrome. This is the first report of clinical findings associated with IARS2 mutations.\n",

      "An X-linked myopathy was recently associated with mutations in the four-and-a-half-LIM domains 1 (FHL1) gene. We identified a family with late onset, slowly progressive weakness of scapuloperoneal muscles in three brothers and their mother. A novel missense mutation in the LIM2 domain of FHL1 (W122C) co-segregated with disease in the family. The phenotype was less severe than that in other reported families. Muscle biopsy revealed myopathic changes with FHL1 inclusions that were ubiquitin- and desmin-positive. This mutation provides additional evidence for X-linked myopathy caused by a narrow spectrum of mutations in FHL1, mostly in the LIM2 domain. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the newly identified mutation and five previously published missense mutations in the LIM2 domain revealed no major distortions of the protein structure or disruption of zinc binding. There were, however, increases in the nonpolar, solvent-accessible surface area in one or both of two clusters of residues, suggesting that the mutant proteins have a variably increased propensity to aggregate. Review of the literature shows a wide range of phenotypes associated with mutations in FHL1. However, recognizing the typical scapuloperoneal phenotype and X-linked inheritance pattern will help clinicians arrive at the correct diagnosis.\n",

      "We present two previously unreported and unrelated female patients, one with the tentative diagnosis of acromegaloid facial appearance (AFA), the other with the tentative diagnosis of hypertrichosis with acromegaloid facial appearance (HAFF) with or without gingival hyperplasia. Main clinical features of HAFF were generalized hypertrichosis terminalis and coarse facial features. In both patients, pregnancy was complicated by polyhydramnios, and both had hyperbilirubinemia and persistent fetal circulation. Development was normal in one patient and slightly delayed in the other. At 13 years, both had round faces with full cheeks, thick scalp hair and eyebrows, a low frontal hairline, hirsutism, hyperextensible joints and deep palmar creases. One of them additionally showed gingival hypertrophy and epicanthus, the other one was macrocephalic at birth and at the age of 13 years and suffered from repeated swelling of the soft tissue. Array analysis excluded a 17q24.2-q24.3 microdeletion, which has been reported in patients with hypertrichosis terminalis with or without gingival hyperplasia. Sequencing of the mutational hotspots of the ABCC9 gene revealed two different de novo missense mutations in the two patients. Recently, identical mutations have been found recurrently in patients with Cant√∫ syndrome. Therefore, we propose that ABCC9 mutations lead to a spectrum of phenotypes formerly known as Cant√∫ syndrome, HAFF and AFA, which may not be clearly distinguishable by clinical criteria, and that all patients with clinical signs belonging to this spectrum should be revisited and offered ABCC9 mutation analysis.\n",

      "Inherited peripheral neuropathies are a genetically heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by distal muscle weakness and sensory loss. Mutations in genes encoding aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases have been implicated in peripheral neuropathies, suggesting that these tRNA charging enzymes are uniquely important for the peripheral nerve. Recently, a mutation in histidyl-tRNA synthetase (HARS) was identified in a single patient with a late-onset, sensory-predominant peripheral neuropathy; however, the genetic evidence was lacking, making the significance of the finding unclear. Here, we present clinical, genetic, and functional data that implicate HARS mutations in inherited peripheral neuropathies. The associated phenotypic spectrum is broad and encompasses axonal and demyelinating motor and sensory neuropathies, including four young patients presenting with pure motor axonal neuropathy. Genome-wide linkage studies in combination with whole-exome and conventional sequencing revealed four distinct and previously unreported heterozygous HARS mutations segregating with autosomal dominant peripheral neuropathy in four unrelated families (p.Thr132Ile, p.Pro134His, p.Asp175Glu and p.Asp364Tyr). All mutations cause a loss of function in yeast complementation assays, and p.Asp364Tyr is dominantly neurotoxic in a Caenorhabditis elegans model. This study demonstrates the role of HARS mutations in peripheral neuropathy and expands the genetic and clinical spectrum of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase-related human disease.\n",

Brain MRI, at 8 months, showed hyperintensity of the deep cerebral and cerebellar white matter, thalamus, basal ganglia, brainstem, and thin corpus callosum. From the second year of life onward, the child reported global clinical improvement, parallel to partial resolution of brain MRI pattern. However, the last neuroimaging assessment revealed novel lesions within the left caudate and pallidum nuclei. DNA genomic sequencing analysis identified a novel EARS2 mutation.This case expands the clinical and neuroradiological phenotype of LTBL presenting intermediate clinical manifestations between the severe and milder forms of the disease and previously unreported brain MRI features.\n",

      "PURPOSE: To describe a previously unreported clinical entity superficially resembling macular serpiginous choroiditis but with a distinct presentation and clinical course. METHODS: A retrospective review of the medical records of five patients, aged 50 to 68 years, exhibiting this entity seen at five different centers from 1999 to 2006. RESULTS: The lesions in the patients in this study are in some respects similar to those of acute macular serpiginous choroiditis. The patients had well-delineated whitish plaque-like lesions involving the macula and sparing the peripapillary areas of both eyes. In contrast to serpiginous choroiditis, visual acuity remained good despite early involvement of the fovea until complications related to choroidal neovascularization (CNV) or pigmentary mottling developed. The angiographic characteristics and the clinical course were also atypical. Fluorescein angiography revealed well-defined early hypofluorescent areas, which partially filled-in in the late phase. Indocyanine green angiography showed the hypofluorescence to be persistent. Unlike serpiginous choroiditis, the white macular lesions faded over a period of months to years, but the characteristic angiographic findings often persisted longer. CNV developed in nine of 10 eyes with subsequent conversion to disciform macular scars in seven of 10 eyes. Unlike serpiginous choroiditis, none of the eyes showed chorioretinal scar formation unless related to CNV. CONCLUSION: Persistent placoid maculopathy has features resembling macular serpiginous choroiditis but differs in its clinical course and effect on visual acuity. It appears to be a new entity. The majority of eyes develop CNV, which results in loss of central vision.\n",

      "Familial progressive hyper- and hypopigmentation (FPHH) is thought to be an autosomal dominant disorder with reduced penetrance. Clinical signs consist of progressive diffuse, partly blotchy hyperpigmented lesions, multiple caf√©-au-lait spots, intermingled with scattered hypopigmented-appearing maculae, and lentigines. FPHH is distinct from familial progressive hyperpigmentation (FPH), in which no hypopigmented features are present, and which is phenotypically and histologically closer to Dyschromatosis Universalis Hereditaria 2 (DUH2). It also differs from the Legius syndrome, characterized by familial caf√©-au-lait spots and skin fold freckling, caused by mutations in SPRED1. We performed a genome-wide linkage analysis in seven families with FPHH, and identified linkage on 12q21.12-q22, which overlaps with the DUH2 locus. We investigated whether KITLG in the locus is mutated in FPHH. We discovered three different mutations in four families. A reported FPH substitution was observed in two FPHH families, and two, to our knowledge, previously unreported substitutions, p.Val33Ala and p.Thr34Pro, cosegregated with FPHH in two separate families. All three mutations were located in a conserved Œ≤-strand in KITLG, suggesting its important role in the activation of the KITLG receptor c-Kit. In aggregate, mutations in a single gene cause various pigmentation disorders: FPH, FPHH, and likely DUH2. Therefore, KITLG is an important modulator of skin pigmentation.\n",

      "Maintaining genomic integrity is critical to avoid life-threatening disorders, such as premature aging, neurodegeneration and cancer. A multiprotein cascade operates at sites of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) to recognize, signal and repair damage. RNF168 (ring-finger nuclear factor) contributes to this emerging pathway of several E3 ubiquitin ligases that perform sequential ubiquitylations on damaged chromosomes, chromatin modifications essential for aggregation of repair complexes at the DSB sites. Here, we report the clinical and cellular phenotypes associated with a newly identified homozygous nonsense mutation in the RNF168 gene of a patient with a syndrome mimicking ataxia-telangiectasia. The mutation eliminated both of RNF168's ubiquitin-binding motifs, thus blocking progression of the ubiquitylation cascade and retention of repair proteins including tumor suppressors 53BP1 and BRCA1 at DSB sites, consistent with the observed defective DNA damage checkpoints/repair and pronounced radiosensitivity. Rapid screening for RNF168 pathway deficiency was achieved by scoring patients' lymphoblastoid cells for irradiation-induced nuclear foci containing 53BP1, a robust assay we propose for future diagnostic applications. The formation of radiation-induced DSB repair foci was rescued by ectopic expression of wild-type RNF168 in patient's cells, further causally linking the RNF168 mutation with the pathology. Clinically, this novel syndrome featured ataxia, telangiectasia, elevated alphafetoprotein, immunodeficiency, microcephaly and pulmonary failure and has implications for the differential diagnosis of autosomal recessive ataxias.\n",

      "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding gene transcripts involved in post-transcriptional regulation of genes. Recent studies identified miRNAs as important regulators of learning and memory in model organisms. So far, no mutations in specific miRNA genes have been associated with impaired cognitive functions.In three sibs and two unrelated patients with intellectual disability (ID), overlapping 1p21.3 deletions were detected by genome-wide array analysis. The shortest region of overlap included dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPYD) and microRNA 137 (MIR137). DPYD is involved in autosomal recessive dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency. Hemizygous DPYD deletions were previously suggested to contribute to a phenotype with autism spectrum disorder and speech delay. Interestingly, the mature microRNA transcript microRNA-137 (miR-137) was recently shown to be involved in modulating neurogenesis in adult murine neuronal stem cells. Therefore, this study investigated the possible involvement of MIR137 in the 1p21.3-deletion phenotype. The patients displayed a significantly decreased expression of both precursor and mature miR-137 levels, as well as significantly increased expression of the validated downstream targets microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) and Enhancer of Zeste, Drosophila, Homologue 2 (EZH2), and the newly identified target Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4). The study also demonstrated significant enrichment of miR-137 at the synapses of cortical and hippocampal neurons, suggesting a role of miR-137 in regulating local synaptic protein synthesis machinery.This study showed that dosage effects of MIR137 are associated with 1p21.3 microdeletions and may therefore contribute to the ID phenotype in patients with deletions harbouring this miRNA. A local effect at the synapse might be responsible.\n",

      "PURPOSE: To report a newly identified syndrome of bilateral microcornea, posterior megalolenticonus, persistent fetal vasculature, and chorioretinal coloboma (MPPC). DESIGN: Noncomparative case series. PARTICIPANTS: Eight patients with MPPC syndrome. METHODS: Clinical data collected retrospectively included visual acuity, findings on office examination as well as examination under anesthesia, and, in some cases, fluorescein angiography. Intraoperative findings and postoperative visual acuity and clinical findings were recorded when surgical intervention was performed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical description, intraoperative findings, and surgical outcomes. RESULTS: All patients were found to have microcornea with corneal diameters of less than 8 mm. In all cases, the crystalline lens was found to be retrodisplaced with massive enlargement and a dramatic posterior lenticonus (posterior megalolenticonus), and the ciliary processes frequently were drawn to the lens capsule. A stalk of persistent fetal vascular tissue extended from the posterior pole of the lens to the optic disc. Posterior chorioretinal coloboma was present in all cases. Some cases also exhibited grossly dysplastic retina. Presentation frequently was asymmetric. Eight eyes of 6 patients underwent lensectomy, vitrectomy, membrane peeling, and fluid-Healon exchange (Healon OVD [sodium hyaluronate]; Advanced Medical Optics, Santa Ana, CA) with functional vision in at least 4 of the 5 patients with postsurgical follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Bilateral microcornea, posterior megalolenticonus, persistent fetal vasculature, and chorioretinal coloboma syndrome is a distinct syndrome previously unreported, to the authors' knowledge, and appropriate surgical intervention may result in significantly improved visual function.\n",

      "Ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase-L1 (UCHL1), a neuron-specific de-ubiquitinating enzyme, is one of the most abundant proteins in the brain. We describe three siblings from a consanguineous union with a previously unreported early-onset progressive neurodegenerative syndrome featuring childhood onset blindness, cerebellar ataxia, nystagmus, dorsal column dysfuction, and spasticity with upper motor neuron dysfunction. Through homozygosity mapping of the affected individuals followed by whole-exome sequencing of the index case, we identified a previously undescribed homozygous missense mutation within the ubiquitin binding domain of UCHL1 (UCHL1(GLU7ALA)), shared by all affected subjects. As demonstrated by isothermal titration calorimetry, purified UCHL1(GLU7ALA), compared with WT, exhibited at least sevenfold reduced affinity for ubiquitin. In vitro, the mutation led to a near complete loss of UCHL1 hydrolase activity. The GLU7ALA variant is predicted to interfere with the substrate binding by restricting the proper positioning of the substrate for tunneling underneath the cross-over loop spanning the catalytic cleft of UCHL1. This interference with substrate binding, combined with near complete loss of hydrolase activity, resulted in a >100-fold reduction in the efficiency of UCHL1(GLU7ALA) relative to WT. These findings demonstrate a broad requirement of UCHL1 in the maintenance of the nervous system.\n",

      "Oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) is a heterogeneous and autosomal recessive disorder with hypopigmentation in the eye, hair, and skin color. Four genes, TYR, OCA2, TYRP1, and SLC45A2, have been identified as causative genes for nonsyndromic OCA1-4, respectively. The genetic identity of OCA5 locus on 4q24 is unknown. Additional unknown OCA genes may exist as at least 5% of OCA patients have not been characterized during mutational screening in several populations. We used exome sequencing with a family-based recessive mutation model to determine that SLC24A5 is a previously unreported candidate gene for nonsyndromic OCA, which we designate as OCA6. Two deleterious mutations in this patient, c.591G>A and c.1361insT, were identified. We found apparent increase of immature melanosomes and less mature melanosomes in the patient's skin melanocytes. However, no defects in the platelet dense granules were observed, excluding typical Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS), a well-known syndromic OCA. Moreover, the SLC24A5 protein was reduced in steady-state levels in mouse HPS mutants with deficiencies in BLOC-1 and BLOC-2. Our results suggest that SLC24A5 is a previously unreported nonsyndromic OCA candidate gene and that the SLC24A5 transporter is transported into mature melanosomes by HPS protein complexes.\n",

      "Recurrent deletions of 2q32q33 have recently been reported as a new microdeletion syndrome, clinical features of which include significant learning difficulties, growth retardation, dysmorphic features, thin and sparse hair, feeding difficulties, and cleft or high palate. Haploinsufficiency of one gene within the deleted region, SATB2, has been suggested to be responsible for most of the features of the syndrome. This article describes seven previously unreported patients with deletions at 2q33.1, all partially overlapping the previously described critical region for the 2q33.1 microdeletion syndrome. The deletions ranged in size from 35 kb to 10.4 Mb, with the smallest deletion entirely within the SATB2 gene. Patients demonstrated significant developmental delay and challenging behaviour, a particular behavioural phenotype that seems to be emerging with more reported patients with this condition. One patient in this cohort has a deletion entirely within SATB2 and has a cleft palate, whereas several patients with larger deletions have a high arched palate. In addition, one other patient has significant orthopaedic problems with ligamentous laxity. Interestingly, this patient has a deletion that lies just distal to SATB2. The orthopaedic problems have not been reported previously and are possibly an additional feature of this syndrome. Overall, this report provides further evidence that the SATB2 gene is the critical gene in this microdeletion syndrome. In addition, because the individuals in this study range in age from 3-19 years, these patients will help define the natural progression of the phenotype in patients with this microdeletion.\n",

A total of 41 different SERAC1 variants were identified, including 20 that have not been reported before. With the exception of 2 families with a milder phenotype, all affected individuals showed a strikingly homogeneous phenotype and time course. Severe, reversible neonatal liver dysfunction and hypoglycemia were seen in >40% of all cases. Starting at a median age of 6 months, muscular hypotonia (91%) was seen, followed by progressive spasticity (82%, median onset‚Äâ=‚Äâ15 months) and dystonia (82%, 18 months). The majority of affected individuals never learned to walk (68%). Seventy-nine percent suffered hearing loss, 58% never learned to speak, and nearly all had significant intellectual disability (88%). Magnetic resonance imaging features were accordingly homogenous, with bilateral basal ganglia involvement (98%); the characteristic \"putaminal eye\" was seen in 53%. The urinary marker 3-methylglutaconic aciduria was present in virtually all patients (98%). Supportive treatment focused on spasticity and drooling, and was effective in the individuals treated; hearing aids or cochlear implants did not improve communication skills. INTERPRETATION:MEGDHEL syndrome is a progressive deafness-dystonia syndrome with frequent and reversible neonatal liver involvement and a strikingly homogenous course of disease.

      "Curry-Jones syndrome (OMIM #601707) is a rare multiple malformation disorder of unknown etiology, associated with brain and skull abnormalities, polysyndactyly, and defects of the eyes, skin and gastrointestinal tract. We report on two new cases of Curry-Jones syndrome with previously unreported features, including benign and malignant neoplasms. The first patient had typical features of Curry-Jones syndrome as well as multiple intra-abdominal smooth muscle hamartomas and trichoblastoma of the skin. The second patient was born with occipital meningoceles and developed a desmoplastic medulloblastoma. Routine lymphocyte karyotype, GLI3 gene analysis and Patched (PTCH) gene analysis on both patients and chromosome microarray analysis on the first patient were normal. We review the previously reported cases of Curry-Jones syndrome and compare our patients' findings. In view of the association of trichoblastoma with basal cell carcinoma and desmoplastic medulloblastoma with nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS) and PTCH mutations, we hypothesize that Curry-Jones syndrome is caused by malfunction of an element in the sonic hedgehog pathway.\n",

      "Filamin A (FLNA) is known to be involved in intracellular actin binding, cell migration, scaffolding, and signaling. We report a novel X-linked syndrome characterized by cardiac valvular disease, keloid scarring and reduced joint mobility in male second cousins due to a previously unreported mutation in FLNA. Whole exome sequencing was performed using standard methods and segregation analysis was performed in affected and non-affected family members. A novel hemizygous c.4726G>A (p.G1576R) mutation in FLNA was detected. Segregation analysis performed on multiple maternal family members showed c.4726G>A (p.G1576R) segregated with disease in an X-linked inheritance pattern. The findings in these cases are distinct from previously described FLNA related disorders by virtue of decreased joint mobility and spontaneous keloid scarring. They occur in association with a novel mutation and represent a novel genetic syndrome.\n",

      "Familial isolated primary hyperparathyroidism (FIHP) is an autosomal dominant disorder that can represent an early stage of either the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) or hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor (HPT-JT) syndromes; alternatively, the condition can be caused by an allelic variant of MEN1 or HRPT2 (hyperparathyroidism 2 gene), or caused by a distinct entity involving another locus. We have explored these possibilities in a patient with primary hyperparathyroidism, whose mother had a history of renal calculi and primary hyperparathyroidism.Serum biochemistry and radiological investigations for primary hyperparathyroidism, MEN1 and HPT-JT, and genetic testing for MEN1 and HRPT2 mutations were undertaken.FIHP with primary hyperparathyroidism as the sole endocrinopathy due to a previously unreported heterozygous missense germline MEN1 mutation, Tyr351Asn. In addition, another unreported heterozygous missense germline MEN1 mutation, Trp220Leu, was identified in an unrelated male patient with FIHP, whose mother and sister also had primary hyperparathyroidism. DNA from a parathyroid tumor from the sister revealed a loss of heterozygosity in which the mutant allele was retained. This is consistent with Knudson's 'two-hit' model of hereditary cancer and a tumor suppressor role for MEN1 in FIHP.The patient underwent parathyroidectomy and has remained normocalcemic over a follow-up period of 6 years. The other four patients have remained normocalcemic for a follow-up period of 4-15 years following parathyroidectomy. None has developed abnormalities of the MEN1 syndrome, providing further support that FIHP is a distinct genetic variant of the MEN1 syndrome.\n",

      "Functional limitations for the vitamin K cycle, caused either by mutations in gamma-glutamyl carboxylase or vitamin K epoxide reductase genes, result in hereditary deficiency of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors (VKCFD1 and VKCFD2, respectively). Patients suffering from VKCFD often share several other anatomical irregularities which are not related to haemostasis. Here we report on nine patients, eight of them previously unreported, who presented with VKCFD1. All were examined with special attention to vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors as well as to bone and heart development and to other anatomical signs of embryonal vitamin K deficiency. In total, we detected ten mutations in the gamma-glutamyl carboxylase gene of which seven have not been previously reported. Most interestingly, additional non-bleeding phenotypes were observed in all patients including midfacial hypoplasia, premature osteoporosis, cochlear hearing loss, heart valve defects, pulmonary stenosis, or pseudoxanthoma elasticum-like phenotype. Undercarboxylated matrix Gla protein, osteocalcin, and periostin appear to be responsible for these defects which are also observed in cases of fetal warfarin syndrome.\n",

      "We report on a case of apparent germline mosaicism in a family of two sisters carrying a novel 19p13.13 deletion. The 11-year-old proposita was referred for evaluation of macrocephaly, moderate intellectual disability (ID), and episodic ataxia. Array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) detected a 399√¢‚Ç¨‚Ä∞kb microdeletion with breakpoints within genes NFIX and CACNA1A. A similar deletion was also seen in the elder sibling who presented with macrocephaly, ID, and strabismus. The deletions were confirmed to be de novo after the parental aCGH analysis suggesting that this is an example of germinal mosaicism. This study contributes additional information for the newly identified 19p13 deletion syndrome and clarifies the clinical roles of genes in the involved region. This case of apparent germline mosaicism represents the only known family in the cohort of 1,800 patients analyzed by our group.\n",

      "Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) arise from pathogenic mutations in over 100 genes leading to impaired protein or lipid glycosylation. ALG1 encodes a Œ≤1,4 mannosyltransferase that catalyzes the addition of the first of nine mannose moieties to form a dolichol-lipid linked oligosaccharide intermediate required for proper N-linked glycosylation. ALG1 mutations cause a rare autosomal recessive disorder termed ALG1-CDG. To date 13 mutations in 18 patients from 14 families have been described with varying degrees of clinical severity. We identified and characterized 39 previously unreported cases of ALG1-CDG from 32 families and add 26 new mutations. Pathogenicity of each mutation was confirmed based on its inability to rescue impaired growth or hypoglycosylation of a standard biomarker in an alg1-deficient yeast strain. Using this approach we could not establish a rank order comparison of biomarker glycosylation and patient phenotype, but we identified mutations with a lethal outcome in the first two years of life. The recently identified protein-linked xeno-tetrasaccharide biomarker, NeuAc-Gal-GlcNAc2 , was seen in all 27 patients tested. Our study triples the number of known patients and expands the molecular and clinical correlates of this disorder.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Several types of epidermal keratinocytic nevus are recognized. OBJECTIVE: We sought to describe a previously unreported keratinocytic nevus with distinctive clinical and histopathologic features in 5 patients. METHODS: We performed a clinical and photographic review, and obtained skin biopsy samples for histopathologic examination from each patient. Genetic analysis to screen for fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, catalytic, alpha hotspot mutations was performed on lesional skin from two patients. RESULTS: Five infants (2 male, 3 female) had from 1 to 11 lesions present since birth. These consisted of 1- to 7-mm hyperkeratotic papules with a rough, flat surface and a round, commalike, rectangular, or polygonal shape. Histopathologic examination showed acanthosis with broad and rectangular rete ridges, and strikingly arranged basal cells with palisaded nuclei. Genetic testing on paraffin-embedded specimens from two patients ruled out hotspot mutations in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, catalytic, alpha genes. LIMITATIONS: A small number of patients are presented. CONCLUSION: We propose the name \"papular epidermal nevus with 'skyline' basal cell layer\" (PENS) for this newly recognized condition.\n",

      "A syndrome compatible with an X-linked trait is described, affecting four male cousins in three sibships. The body had skeletal anomalies, including short stature, ridging of the metopic suture, fusion of cervical vertebrae, thoracic hemivertebrae, scoliosis, sarcral hypoplasia and short middle phalanges. In addition, they had moderate developmental retardation, and abducens palsies. Three of the four had glucose intolerance, and one was born with an imperforate anus. Of five female obligate carriers studied, three had fusion of cervical vertebrae, three had some shortening of the middle phalanges and three had glucose intolerance. The syndrome in this family was compared to previously reported syndromes, and the conclusion was reached that it represents a previously unreported X-linked syndrome with minor manifestations in carrier females.\n",

      "Mitochondrial diseases are characterised by clinical, molecular and functional heterogeneity, reflecting their bi-genomic control. The nuclear gene GFM2 encodes mtEFG2, a protein with an essential role during the termination stage of mitochondrial translation. We present here two unrelated patients harbouring different and previously unreported compound heterozygous (c.569G>A, p.(Arg190Gln); c.636delA, p.(Glu213Argfs*3)) and homozygous (c.275A>C, p.(Tyr92Ser)) recessive variants in GFM2 identified by whole exome sequencing (WES) together with histochemical and biochemical findings to support the diagnoses of pathological GFM2 variants in each case. Both patients presented similarly in early childhood with global developmental delay, raised CSF lactate and abnormalities on cranial MRI. Sanger sequencing of familial samples confirmed the segregation of bi-allelic GFM2 variants with disease, while investigations into steady-state mitochondrial protein levels revealed respiratory chain subunit defects and loss of mtEFG2 protein in muscle. These data demonstrate the effects of defective mtEFG2 function, caused by previously unreported variants, confirming pathogenicity and expanding the clinical phenotypes associated with GFM2 variants.\n",

      "OBJECTIVE: To estimate cystic fibrosis (CF) birth rates in Canada from 1971 to 2000 and to assess the population impact of genetic testing in families with a history of CF, after identification of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator gene in 1989. STUDY DESIGN: Age-at-diagnosis data were obtained from the Canadian Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Data Registry and Canadian births for the corresponding years from Canadian Vital Statistics. Estimates of the CF birth rate in each year were based on a nonparametric model that allows the birth rate to vary across the years and adjusts for censoring of currently undiagnosed patients. RESULTS: The overall CF birth rate from 1971-1987 was 1/2714 with no increasing or decreasing trend. Beginning in 1988, 1 year before identification of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator gene, estimated CF birth rates followed a linear decline to an estimated rate of 1/3608 in 2000. CF birth rates may have stabilized in the last few years, but further decline may occur with implementation of carrier screening in the general population. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate the temporal association of genetic testing and declining CF birth rates in Canada. They may assist in decisions relating to the allocation of resources for prenatal and neonatal CF screening programs.\n",

      "Mucolipidosis type IV (MLIV) is a neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorder that occurs in an increased frequency in the Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) population.

A carrier rate of 0.0104 (95% C.I 0.0097-0.011) was found. The distribution of the 2 AJ founder mutations, namely, c.416-2A>G and c.1_788del, was determined to be 78.15% and 21.85%, respectively. Three novel mutations were identified in non-Jewish MLIV patients, a missense mutation c.1207C>T, p.Arg403Cys; a 2bp deletion, c.302_303delTC; and a nonsense, c.235C>T, Gln79X. \n",

      "Mevalonate kinase deficiency (MKD), a very rare autosomal recessive autoinflammatory disease with multiple organ involvement, presents clinically as hyperimmunoglobulinemia D syndrome (HIDS), a less severe phenotype and more common form, and mevalonic aciduria (MVA), a more severe phenotype and rare form. MKD is characterized by recurrent febrile attacks that are frequently accompanied by lymphadenopathy, gastrointestinal symptoms, arthralgia, myalgia, skin rash, and aphthous ulcers. Patients with MVA also have intrauterine growth retardation, congenital defects (cataracts, shortened limbs, and dysmorphic craniofacial features), neurological disease, and failure to thrive. Mean age at onset of symptoms is within the first year of life. There is a delay by several years between symptom onset and diagnosis, which is in part attributable to the initial misdiagnosis due to the rarity and nonspecific clinical manifestations of disease. The frequency of recurrent febrile attacks is highest in childhood and gradually decreases after adolescence. MKD is associated with rare long-term complications such as type AA amyloidosis, joint contractures, abdominal adhesions, renal angiomyolipoma, and severe pneumococcal infections. Frequent febrile attacks significantly impair several aspects of patients' and caregivers' quality of life, with an adverse impact on patients' daily activities, education, and employment. Lifespan is generally normal for HIDS whereas MVA can be fatal in early childhood. \n",

      "BACKGROUND: The kyphoscoliotic type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS VIA) (OMIM 225400) is a rare inheritable connective tissue disorder characterized by a deficiency of collagen lysyl hydroxylase 1 (LH1; EC 1.14.11.4) due to mutations in PLOD1. Biochemically this results in underhydroxylation of collagen lysyl residues and, hence, an abnormal pattern of lysyl pyridinoline (LP) and hydroxylysyl pyridinoline (HP) crosslinks excreted in the urine. Clinically the disorder is characterized by hypotonia and kyphoscoliosis at birth, joint hypermobility, and skin hyperelasticity and fragility. Severe hypotonia usually leads to delay in gross motor development, whereas cognitive development is reported to be normal. METHODS: We describe the clinical, biochemical and molecular characterisation, as well as electron microscopy findings of skin, in 15 patients newly diagnosed with this rare type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. RESULTS: Age at diagnosis ranged from 5 months to 27 years, with only 1/3 of the patients been diagnosed correctly in the first year of life. A similar disease frequency was found in females and males, however a broad disease severity spectrum (intra- and interfamilial), independent of molecular background or biochemical phenotype, was observed. Kyphoscoliosis, one of the main clinical features was not present at birth in 4 patients. Importantly we also noted the occurrence of vascular rupture antenatally and postnatally, as well as developmental delay in 5 patients. CONCLUSION: In view of these findings we propose that EDS VIA is a highly variable clinical entity, presenting with a broad clinical spectrum, which may also be associated with cognitive delay and an increased risk for vascular events. Genotype/phenotype association studies and additional molecular investigations in more extended EDS VIA populations will be necessary to further elucidate the cause of the variability of the disease severity. \n",

      "The data of 750 consecutive uveitis patients who visited the uveitis department of the Rotterdam Eye Hospital were analysed by computer. Anterior uveitis was diagnosed most frequently (52%), mostly the acute form. We found a high percentage of Fuchs' heterochromic iridocyclitis and HLA-B27+ iridocyclitis. In the posterior uveitis group appeared the more recent clinical entities such as acute retinal necrosis, Birdshot retinochoroidopathy, CMV-retinitis, AMPPE and ocular candidiasis. Ocular Toxoplasmosis was still the leading cause in this group. These data will be compared with other studies of similar populations. Factors influencing frequency of subtypes of uveitis and bias of this study will be discussed. \n",

      "Diastrophic dysplasia is an autosomal recessive disorder of the skeleton, characterized by disproportionate short stature, generalized joint deformities, club feet, deformed ear pinnae, and, frequently, spinal deformity and cleft palate. Diastrophic dysplasia is more common in Finland than elsewhere. We studied 101 patients with an age range from newborns to 79 years to find out the frequency and type of spinal deformities, the early signs of progressive cases, and to follow the natural history of the disease. In the follow-up study, 17 patients were under 10 years, 21 under 21 years, and 63 over 21 years of age. One-third of the patients had cervical kyphosis; in the most severe case the kyphosis was 180 degrees and led to quadriplegia during anesthesia. In three patients, cervical kyphosis resolved spontaneously before the age of 5 years. The overall frequency of scoliosis was 37%; 49% in women and 22% in men. Only 13 patients had curves greater than 50 degrees; these curves constituted distinct rotation at the apex from the early evolution of the curve. The early signs of severe curves were detectable at the age of 2 to 4 years. Only two patients were operated on because of scoliosis; one with fusion in situ and the other instrumented with the pediatric Cotrel-Dubousset instrumentation. Three patients had a brace, which did not prevent the progression of the curve. Symptoms referring to a narrow spinal canal were registered in four patients, two of which were operated on; a lumbar posterior decompressive procedure was made at adult age. \n",

      "BACKGROUND:Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS), a hereditary multisystem disorder with oculocutaneous albinism, may be caused by mutations in one of at least 10 separate genes. The HPS-2 subtype is distinguished by the presence of neutropenia and knowledge of its pulmonary phenotype in children is scarce. METHODS:Six children with genetically proven HPS-2 presented to the chILD-EU register between 2009 and 2017; the data were collected systematically and imaging studies were scored blinded. RESULTS:Pulmonary symptoms including dyspnea, coughing, need for oxygen, and clubbing started 3.3¬†years before the diagnosis was made at the mean age of 8.83¬†years (range 2-15). All children had recurrent pulmonary infections, 3 had a spontaneous pneumothorax, and 4 developed scoliosis. The frequency of pulmonary complaints increased over time. The leading radiographic pattern was ground-glass opacities with a rapid increase in reticular pattern and traction bronchiectasis between initial and follow-up Computer tomography (CT) in all subjects. Honeycombing and cysts were newly detectable in 3 patients. Half of the patients received a lung biopsy for diagnosis; histological patterns were cellular non-specific interstitial pneumonia, usual interstitial pneumonia-like, and desquamative interstitial pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS:HPS-2 is characterized by a rapidly fibrosing lung disease during early childhood. Effective treatments are required. \n",

      "Leukodystrophies are a heterogeneous group of disorders associated with abnormal central nervous system white matter. The clinical features invariably include upper motor neuron signs and developmental regression with or without other neurological manifestations. The objective of this study was to characterize clinically and genetically a new form of childhood-onset leukodystrophy with ataxia and tremor. We recruited seven French-Canadian cases belonging to five families affected by an unknown form of childhood-onset leukodystrophy. Genome-wide scans (GWS) were performed using the Illumina Hap310 or Hap610 Bead Chip to identify regions of shared homozygosity that were further studied for linkage with STS markers. All cases presented between the ages of 1 and 5 years with spasticity along with other upper motor neuron signs, prominent postural tremor, and cerebellar signs. Though motor regression is a constant feature, cognitive functions are relatively preserved, even late in the course of the disease. The higher frequency of founder diseases in the French-Canadian population and the segregation in pedigrees are suggestive of a recessive mode of inheritance. By homozygosity mapping, we established linkage to a 12.6-Mb SNP-haplotyped region on chromosome 10q22.3-10q23.31 (maximum LOD score: 5.47). We describe an autosomal recessive childhood-onset leukodystrophy with ataxia and tremor mapping to a 12.6 Mb interval on chromosome 10q22.3-10q23.31. Identification of the mutated gene will allow precise diagnosis and genetic counseling and shed light on how its perturbed function leads to white matter abnormalities. \n",

      "We recently reported mutations in the sodium channel gene SCN2A in two families with benign familial neonatal-infantile seizures (BFNISs). Here, we aimed to refine the molecular-clinical correlation of SCN2A mutations in early childhood epilepsies. SCN2A was analyzed in 2 families with probable BFNIS, 9 with possible BFNIS, 10 with benign familial infantile seizures, and in 93 additional families with various early childhood epilepsies. Mutations effecting changes in conserved amino acids were found in two of two probable BFNIS families, in four of nine possible BFNIS families, and in none of the others. Our eight families had six different SCN2A mutations; one mutation (R1319Q) occurred in three families. BFNIS is an autosomal dominant disorder presenting between day 2 and 7 months (mean, 11.2 +/- 9.2 weeks) with afebrile secondarily generalized partial seizures; neonatal seizures were not seen in all families. The frequency of seizures varied; some individuals had only a few attacks without treatment and others had clusters of many per day. Febrile seizures were rare. All cases remitted by 12 months. Ictal recordings in four subjects showed onset in the posterior quadrants. SCN2A mutations appear specific for BFNIS; the disorder can now be strongly suspected clinically and the families can be given an excellent prognosis. \n",

      "OBJECTIVE:To define the occurrence rate of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) using established criteria in a well-defined general patient population, to study the clinical course of ARDS when patients were ventilated using a \"lung-protective\" strategy, and to define the total costs of care. DESIGN:A 3-yr (1993 through 1995) retrospective descriptive analysis of all patients with ARDS treated in Kuopio University Hospital. SETTING:Intensive care unit in the university hospital. PATIENTS:Fifty-nine patients fulfilled the definition of ARDS: Pao2/Fio2 <200 mm Hg (33.3 kPa) during mechanical ventilation and bilateral infiltrates on chest radiograph. INTERVENTIONS:None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS:With a patient data management system, the day-by-day data of hemodynamics, ventilation, respiratory mechanics, gas exchange, and organ failures were collected during the period that Pao2/Fio2 ratio was <200 mm Hg (33.3 kPa). The frequency of ARDS was 4.9 cases/100,000 inhabitants/yr. Pneumonia and sepsis were the most common causes of ARDS. Mean age was 43+/-2 yrs. At the time of lowest Pao2/Fio2, the nonsurvivors had lower arterial and venous oxygen saturations and higher arterial lactate than survivors, whereas there were no differences between the groups in other parameters. Multiple organ dysfunction preceded the worst oxygenation in both the survivors and nonsurvivors. The intensive care mortality was 37%; hospital mortality and mortality after a minimum 8 months of follow-up was 42%. The most frequent cause of death was multiple organ failure. The effective costs of intensive care per survivor were US $73,000. CONCLUSIONS:The outcome of ARDS is unpredictable at the time of onset and also at the time of the worst oxygenation. Keeping the inspiratory pressures low (30-35 cm H2O [2.94 to 3.43 kPa]) reduces the frequency of pneumothorax, and might lower the mortality. Most patients are young, and therefore the costs per saved year of life are low. \n",

      "BACKGROUND:Alagille syndrome (AGS) is a multi-system, autosomal dominant disorder with highly variable expressivity, caused by mutations within the Jagged1 (JAG1) gene. METHODS:We studied 53 mutation positive relatives of 34 AGS probands to ascertain the frequency of clinical findings in JAG1 mutation carriers. RESULTS:Eleven of 53 (21%) mutation positive relatives had clinical features that would have led to a diagnosis of AGS. Seventeen of the 53 (32%) relatives had mild features of AGS, revealed only after targeted evaluation following the diagnosis of a proband in their family. Twenty five of the 53 (47%) mutation positive relatives did not meet clinical criteria, and two of these individuals had no features consistent with AGS at all. The frequency of cardiac and liver disease was notably lower in the relatives than in the probands, characterising the milder end of the phenotypic spectrum. The characteristic facies of AGS was the feature with the highest penetrance, occurring almost universally in mutation positive probands and relatives. CONCLUSIONS:This study has implications for genetic counselling of families with AGS and JAG1 mutations. \n",

      "A review of the literature concerning psychogenic purpura is presented. The diagnosis is usually based on typical anamnestic data, clinical presentation (painful inflammatory skin lesions, which progressed to ecchymoses during the next 24 h) and positive diagnostic tests with intracutaneous injections of 80% solution of washed autologous erythrocytes. No pathological findings of blood coagulation parameters are usually detected. Histopathological evaluations of lesional biopsies revealed non-specific changes. Taking into account the high frequency of psychic disorders and stress dependence of skin symptoms, therapy with psychotropic drugs (according to indications) and psychotherapy are pathogenetically grounded methods of treatment in psychogenic purpura, and should be provided together with symptomatic therapy. \n",

      "CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS:Unverricht-Lundborg disease (EPM1) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by onset from age six to 15 years, stimulus-sensitive myoclonus, and tonic-clonic epileptic seizures. Some years after the onset, ataxia, incoordination, intentional tremor, and dysarthria develop. Individuals with EPM1 are mentally alert but show emotional lability, depression, and mild decline in intellectual performance over time. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING:EPM1 results from defective function of cystatin B, a cysteine protease inhibitor, as a consequence of mutation of CSTB. The diagnosis can be confirmed by identifying the common dodecamer repeat expansion or other pathogenic variants in CSTB. MANAGEMENT:Treatment of manifestations: Symptomatic pharmacologic and rehabilitative management, including psychosocial support, are the mainstay of care; valproic acid, the first drug of choice, diminishes myoclonus and the frequency of generalized seizures; clonazepam, approved by FDA for the treatment of myoclonic seizures, is an add-on therapy; high-dose piracetam is used to treat myoclonus; levetiracetam appears to be effective for both myoclonus and generalized seizures. Topiramate and zonisamide may also be used as add-on therapy. Surveillance: Lifelong clinical follow up, including evaluation of drug treatment and rehabilitation. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Phenytoin aggravates neurologic symptoms or even accelerates cerebellar degeneration; sodium channel blockers (carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine), GABAergic drugs (tiagabine, vigabatrin) and gabapentin and pregabalin may aggravate myoclonus and myoclonic seizures. GENETIC COUNSELING:EPM1 is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are possible if both CSTB pathogenic variants in a family are known. \n",

      "Hearing loss, bone fragility, and blue sclerae are the principal clinical features in osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), a genetic disorder of connective tissue. In a nationwide search, an audiometric evaluation of 133 adult patients was performed. According to the criteria introduced by Sillence, type I was the most common form of OI. Of the patients with normal hearing on audiometry, 17.1% reported subjective hearing loss, and 19.1% of the patients with impaired hearing did not recognize it. On audiometry, 57.9% of the patients had hearing loss, which was progressive, often of mixed type, and mostly bilateral, and began in the second to fourth decades of life. The frequency or severity of the hearing loss was not correlated with any other clinical features of OI. Hearing loss is common, affecting patients with all types of OI. Subjective misjudgment of hearing ability supports the need for repeated audiometry in all OI patients. A baseline study at the age of OI years followed by audiograms every third year thereafter is recommended. \n",

      "No reports on the frequency of X-linked ichthyosis (XLI) in the Italian general population and few surveys on the frequency of XLI in large communities in the world are available.The aim of this study was the assessment of the frequency of XLI in a large representative sample of the Italian male population.This study involved young men who enlisted as conscripts in the Italian Navy from January 1998 through February 2002, examined, prior to enlistment, at the Draft Council's Medical Unit of the Italian Navy in Taranto, Italy, to evaluate their psychophysical fitness. All the patients with an ichthyosiform condition were referred to the Department of Dermatology of the Navy Hospital, underwent a thorough dermatological examination and completed a questionnaire regarding their personal and familial history. Pertinent results of the other clinical investigations were recorded and the final diagnosis was formulated on the basis of all these data.From January 1998 through February 2002, of 75,653 young men examined, 15 cases of XLI were diagnosed, with a frequency of 1:5,043 or 1.98 per 10,000 (95% confidence interval based on the Poisson distribution 1.01-2.90). Four out of 15 cases (26.6%) showed corneal opacities. No other significant associated pathological change was observed.As this study is a survey involving a large male sample, homogeneous with reference to age, race and country of origin (southern Italy), the frequency of XLI could be estimated at about 1.98 per 10,000 males. These data are roughly in agreement with estimates from other European surveys. \n",

      "In a nationwide study in Finland, 78 patients, 38 male and 40 female in 25 families, were found to have Alport's syndrome, corresponding to 1 in 53,000 live births. This frequency of clinically manifest Alport's syndrome was much lower than expected from earlier reports. This first sign of the disease was most often haematuria, but was sometimes proteinuria or hearing loss. These signs were detected at a similar median age in both boys and girls, namely 6.2 and 6.0 years, respectively. The patients were followed up over a median period of 12.1 years (range 0.1 - 34.0 years). The clinical course of the disease was more severe in the male subjects than in the female subjects: 53% of the males and 13% of the females developed terminal renal failure at median ages of 24.9 and 31.1 years, respectively. At the last observation, 34% males and 78% females were free of renal insufficiency at median ages of 10.3 and 26.8 years. Hearing loss was detected in 74% of the males and 5% of the females. Regarding the rate of deterioration of renal function, no statistically significant difference was noticed between males and females. The routine use of dialysis and transplantations has dramatically changed the life expectancy of the patients. \n",

      "A clinical, genetic and epidemiological study of hereditary ataxias and paraplegias was conducted within a defined area (Cantabria) in Northern Spain from 1974 to 1986. The series comprised 48 index cases and 65 affected relatives. On prevalence day, 103 patients were alive, giving a prevalence of 20.2 cases per 100,000. There were 24 patients (18 families) with Friedreich's ataxia (FA), 12 (6 families) with early onset cerebellar ataxia (EOCA) differing from FA, 6 (3 families) with dominantly transmitted late onset cerebellar ataxia (LOCA), 11 with 'idiopathic' LOCA, 49 (9 families) with 'pure' hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), and 1 patient with congenital cerebellar ataxia. The prevalence found here is comparable with the highest figures described in previous surveys. This may in part be due to the great number of secondary cases in our series. A high frequency of parental consanguinity occurred in FA patients, 'pseudodominant' inheritance being observed in 1 family. The clinical features were those of classical FA except for later onset and slower course in 1 family, and retained tendon reflexes in the lower limbs in 2 cases. Such data indicate the need for modification of the essential criteria for the disease. EOCA included 4 patients with normoreflexic ataxia and 1 patient with ataxia and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone deficiency. In addition, there were 7 patients from 2 unrelated families with a homogeneous syndrome characterized by autosomal recessive inheritance, cerebellar ataxia, retinitis pigmentosa and sensory neuropathy. This syndrome is therefore a well defined nosological entity to be added to the list of autosomal recessive mendelian phenotypes. The clinical picture of patients with LOCA was either a 'pure' cerebellar or a 'cerebellar-plus' syndrome. Genetic subgroups of 'pure' HSP were autosomal dominant type I in 5 families and type II in 2, and autosomal recessive in 2 families. \n",

      "Genetic factors are important in all forms of dementia, especially in early onset dementia. The frequency of major gene defects in dementia has not been investigated in the Netherlands. Furthermore, whether the recently in a FTD family identified PRKAR1B gene is associated with an Alzheimer's disease (AD) like phenotype, has not been studied. With this study, we aimed to investigate the mutation frequency of the major AD and FTD genes and the PRKAR1B gene in a well-defined Dutch cohort of patients with early onset dementia. Mutation analysis of the genes PSEN1, APP, MAPT, GRN, C9orf72 and PRKAR1B was performed on DNA of 229 patients with the clinical diagnosis AD and 74 patients with the clinical diagnosis FTD below the age of 70 years. PSEN1 and APP mutations were found in, respectively 3.5 and 0.4 % of AD patients, and none in FTD patients. C9orf72 repeat expansions were present in 0.4 % of AD and in 9.9 % of FTD patients, whereas MAPT and GRN mutations both were present in 0.4 % in AD patients, and in 1.4 % resp. 2.7 % in FTD patients. We did not find any pathogenic mutations in the PRKAR1B gene. PSEN1 mutations are the most common genetic cause in Dutch AD patients, whereas MAPT and GRN mutations were found in less than 5 percent. C9orf72 repeat expansions were the most common genetic defect in FTD patients. No pathogenic PRKAR1B mutations were found in the early onset AD and FTD patients of our study. \n",

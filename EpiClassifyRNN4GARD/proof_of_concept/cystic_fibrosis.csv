32540174,"BACKGROUND:The prevalence of fungal disease in cystic fibrosis (CF) and non-CF bronchiectasis is increasing and the clinical spectrum is widening. Poor sensitivity and a lack of standard diagnostic criteria renders interpretation of culture results challenging. In order to develop effective management strategies, a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of the airways fungal microbiome is required. The study aimed to use DNA sequences from sputum to assess the load and diversity of fungi in adults with CF and non-CF bronchiectasis. METHODS:Next generation sequencing of the ITS2 region was used to examine fungal community composition (n = 176) by disease and underlying clinical subgroups including allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, chronic necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis, non-tuberculous mycobacteria, and fungal bronchitis. Patients with no known active fungal disease were included as disease controls. RESULTS:ITS2 sequencing greatly increased the detection of fungi from sputum. In patients with CF fungal diversity was lower, while burden was higher than those with non-CF bronchiectasis. The most common operational taxonomic unit (OTU) in patients with CF was Candida parapsilosis (20.4%), whereas in non-CF bronchiectasis sputum Candida albicans (21.8%) was most common. CF patients with overt fungal bronchitis were dominated by Aspergillus spp., Exophiala spp., Candida parapsilosis or Scedosporium spp. CONCLUSION:This study provides a framework to more accurately characterize the extended spectrum of fungal airways diseases in adult suppurative lung diseases.",0.9975857734680176,True
32097175,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW:Liver disease in cystic fibrosis (CF) usually develops before puberty, is often asymptomatic and slowly progressive. Multilobular cirrhosis develops in approximately 5-10% of patients by the age of 18, and is a significant contributor to the morbidity and mortality. No therapy, including ursodeoxycholic acid and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator correctors or potentiators, has proven effective to prevent or halt the progression of liver disease towards cirrhosis and portal hypertension. This review provides the current knowledge in the epidemiology of CF liver disease and development of noninvasive tools to assess liver disease severity and progression overtime in order to optimize clinical management and therapeutic options. RECENT FINDINGS:Liver disease not only develops during childhood but also later in the lifetime of patients with CF; the incidence of cirrhosis with portal hypertension increases progressively reaching 10% by age 30. Several noninvasive tools to measure liver stiffness as an indirect measure of fibrosis are being investigated, and show promising results for the assessment of early stages of liver fibrosis and disease progression. SUMMARY:Identifying noninvasive biomarkers is fundamental to improving early diagnosis, monitoring disease evolution and measuring treatment effects. A prerequisite is the use of consistent definitions for CF- liver disease (LD) in clinical trials.",0.29737699031829834,False
32670584,"Newborn screening for cystic fibrosis is universal across the United States; however, each state chooses the method by which they screen. Illinois employs a two-step process which includes the measurement of the immunoreactive trypsinogen followed by an assay designed to detect 74 of the most common genetic mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein. We report the case of an infant born in Illinois with a positive cystic fibrosis newborn screening with an elevated immunoreactive trypsinogen and two genetic mutations identified (F508del/F508del). The primary care physician informed the parents their child had cystic fibrosis and referred her for a confirmatory sweat test which was negative for cystic fibrosis. Upon further investigation, the assay was found to have been set up incorrectly and repeat analysis identified the genotype F508del/F508C. This case highlights the importance of performing the confirmatory sweat test prior to making a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis.",0.09940485656261444,False
32505496,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a multisystem disease affecting the gastrointestinal (GI) tract as well as the lungs. As survival has increased significantly over the past few decades, complications not seen previously have become apparent. There is an overall increased rate of malignancy in CF, particularly from the GI tract and in the post-transplant population. The most common sites of malignancy are the pancreatico-biliary and digestive tract, as well as an increased rate of testicular cancer. Using an illustrative case of metastatic oesophageal malignancy which initially appeared to be hepatic in origin, we have reviewed the literature surrounding malignancy in CF with a particular focus on the GI tract.",0.06782692670822144,False
32718005,"Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a chronic autosomal recessive disease caused by defects in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene (CFTR). Cystic Fibrosis affects multiple organs but progressive remodeling of the airways, mucus accumulation, and chronic inflammation in the lung, result in lung disease as the major cause of morbidity and mortality. While advances in management of CF symptoms have increased the life expectancy of this devastating disease, and there is tremendous excitement about the potential of new agents targeting the CFTR molecule itself, there is still no curative treatment. With the recent advances in the identification of endogenous airway progenitor cells and in directed differentiation of pluripotent cell sources, cell-based therapeutic approaches for CF have become a plausible treatment method with the potential to ultimately cure the disease. In this review, we highlight the current state of cell therapy in the CF field focusing on the relevant autologous and allogeneic cell populations under investigation and the challenges associated with their use. In addition, we present advances in induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell approaches and emerging new genetic engineering methods, which have the capacity to overcome the current limitations hindering cell therapy approaches.",0.0635165274143219,False
32668165,"Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease caused by mutations in the CFTR gene. Although viral respiratory tract infections are, in general, more severe in patients with CF compared to the general population, a small number of studies indicate that SARS-CoV-2 does not cause a worse infection in CF. This is surprising since comorbidities including preexisting lung disease have been reported to be associated with worse outcomes in SARS-CoV-2 infections. Several recent studies provide insight into why SARS-CoV-2 may not produce more severe outcomes in CF. First, ACE and ACE2, genes that play key roles in SARS-CoV-2 infection have some variants that are predicted to reduce the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Second, mRNA for ACE2 is elevated and the mRNA for TMPRSS2, a serine protease, is decreased in CF airway epithelial cells. Increased ACE2 is predicted to enhance SARS-CoV-2 binding to cells, but would increase conversion of angiotensin II, which is proinflammatory, to angiotensin-1-7, which is anti-inflammatory. Thus, increased ACE2 would reduce inflammation and lung damage due to SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, decreased TMPRSS2 would reduce SARS-CoV-2 entry into airway epithelial cells. Second, many CF patients are treated with azithromycin, which suppresses viral infection and lung inflammation, and inhibits the activity of furin, a serine protease. Finally, the CF lung contains high levels of serine protease inhibitors including ecotin and SERPINB1, which are predicted to reduce the ability of TMPRSS2 to facilitate SARS-CoV-2 entry into airway epithelial cells. Thus, a variety of factors may mitigate the severity of SARS-CoV-2 in CF.",0.043597038835287094,False
32475007,"BACKGROUND:Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a multisystem disease caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator is extensively expressed in the intestine and has an important role in the regulation of the viscosity and pH of gut secretions. Several studies have reported a delay in small bowel and colonic transit times in patients with CF which have been attributed to the secretory dysfunction. Our aim was to determine whether intestinal contractility is affected in these patients. METHODS:Consecutive patients with CF referred to our institution between 2014 and 2017 (n = 16) were prospectively investigated using automated non-invasive techniques for morpho-functional evaluation of the gut developed in our laboratory. On separate days, intraluminal images of the gut were obtained by capsule endoscopy and external images by abdominal MRI. Analysis of images (endoluminal and external) was performed with original, previously validated programs based on computer vision and machine learning techniques and compared with age- and sex-matched controls. KEY RESULTS:Patients with CF exhibited important reduction in contractile activity and increased retention of static turbid luminal content in the small bowel by endoluminal image analysis. Morpho-volumetric analysis of MRI images found increased ileo-colonic volumes in CF. Significant correlations between abnormalities detected by intraluminal and external imaging techniques were found. The presence and severity of digestive symptoms were not related to abnormal gut function. CONCLUSION AND INFERENCES:Impaired transit and pooling of gut contents in patients with CF is associated with impaired intestinal motility.",0.03283175453543663,False
32397175,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease is characterized by unconventional mechanisms of inflammation, implicating a chronic immune response dominated by innate immune cells. Historically, therapeutic development has focused on the mutated cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), leading to the discovery of small molecules aiming at modulating and potentiating the presence and activity of CFTR at the plasma membrane. However, treatment burden sustained by CF patients, side effects of current medications, and recent advances in other therapeutic areas have highlighted the need to develop novel disease targeting of the inflammatory component driving CF lung damage. Furthermore, current issues with standard treatment emphasize the need for directed lung therapies that could minimize systemic side effects. Here, we summarize current treatment used to target immune cells in the lungs, and highlight potential benefits and caveats of novel therapeutic strategies.",0.02109353430569172,False
32358807,"BACKGROUND:Several agents are used to clear secretions from the airways of people with cystic fibrosis. Mannitol increases mucociliary clearance, but its exact mechanism of action is unknown. The dry powder formulation of mannitol may be more convenient and easier to use compared with established agents which require delivery via a nebuliser. Phase III trials of inhaled dry powder mannitol for the treatment of cystic fibrosis have been completed and it is now available in Australia and some countries in Europe. This is an update of a previous review. OBJECTIVES:To assess whether inhaled dry powder mannitol is well tolerated, whether it improves the quality of life and respiratory function in people with cystic fibrosis and which adverse events are associated with the treatment. SEARCH METHODS:We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic databases, handsearching relevant journals and abstracts from conferences. Date of last search: 12 December 2019. SELECTION CRITERIA:All randomised controlled studies comparing mannitol with placebo, active inhaled comparators (for example, hypertonic saline or dornase alfa) or with no treatment. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS:Authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, carried out data extraction and assessed the risk of bias in included studies. The quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE. MAIN RESULTS:Six studies (reported in 36 unique publications) were included with a total of 784 participants. Duration of treatment in the included studies ranged from 12 days to six months, with open-label treatment for an additional six months in two of the studies. Five studies compared mannitol with control (a very low dose of mannitol or non-respirable mannitol) and the final study compared mannitol to dornase alfa alone and to mannitol plus dornase alfa. Two large studies had a similar parallel design and provided data for 600 participants, which could be pooled where data for a particular outcome and time point were available. The remaining studies had much smaller sample sizes (ranging from 22 to 95) and data could not be pooled due to differences in design, interventions and population. Pooled evidence from the two large parallel studies was judged to be of low to moderate quality and from the smaller studies was judged to be of low to very low quality. In all studies, there was an initial test to see if participants tolerated mannitol, with only those who could tolerate the drug being randomised; therefore, the study results are not applicable to the cystic fibrosis population as a whole. While the published papers did not provide all the data required for our analysis, additional unpublished data were provided by the drug's manufacturer and the author of one of the studies. Pooling the large parallel studies comparing mannitol to control, up to and including six months, lung function (forced expiratory volume at one second) measured in both mL and % predicted was significantly improved in the mannitol group compared to the control group (moderate-quality evidence). Beneficial results were observed in these studies in adults and in both concomitant dornase alfa users and non-users in these studies. In the smaller studies, statistically significant improvements in lung function were also observed in the mannitol groups compared to the non-respirable mannitol groups; however, we judged this evidence to be of low to very low quality. For the comparisons of mannitol and control, we found no consistent differences in health-related quality of life in any of the domains except for burden of treatment, which was less for mannitol up to four months in the two pooled studies of a similar design; this difference was not maintained at six months. It should be noted that the tool used to measure health-related quality of life was not designed to assess mucolytics and pooling of the age-appropriate tools (as done in some of the included studies) may not be valid so results were judged to be low to very low quality and should be interpreted with caution. Cough, haemoptysis, bronchospasm, pharyngolaryngeal pain and post-tussive vomiting were the most commonly reported side effects in both treatment groups. Where rates of adverse events could be compared, statistically no significant differences were found between mannitol and control groups; although some of these events may have clinical relevance for people with CF. For the comparisons of mannitol to dornase alfa alone and to mannitol plus dornase alfa, very low-quality evidence from a 12-week cross-over study of 28 participants showed no statistically significant differences in the recorded domains of health-related quality of life or measures of lung function. Cough was the most common side effect in the mannitol alone arm but there was no occurrence of cough in the dornase alfa alone arm and the most commonly reported reason of withdrawal from the mannitol plus dornase alfa arm was pulmonary exacerbations. In terms of secondary outcomes of the review (pulmonary exacerbations, hospitalisations, symptoms, sputum microbiology), evidence provided by the included studies was more limited. For all comparisons, no consistent statistically significant and clinically meaningful differences were observed between mannitol and control treatments (including dornase alfa). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS:There is moderate-quality evidence to show that treatment with mannitol over a six-month period is associated with an improvement in some measures of lung function in people with cystic fibrosis compared to control. There is low to very low-quality evidence suggesting no difference in quality of life for participants taking mannitol compared to control. This review provides very low-quality evidence suggesting no difference in lung function or quality of life comparing mannitol to dornase alfa alone and to mannitol plus dornase alfa. The clinical implications from this review suggest that mannitol could be considered as a treatment in cystic fibrosis; but further research is required in order to establish who may benefit most and whether this benefit is sustained in the longer term. Furthermore, studies comparing its efficacy against other (established) mucolytic therapies need to be undertaken before it can be considered for mainstream practice.",0.016816643998026848,False
32374578,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW:Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance receptor (CFTR) modulators are a new class of drugs that treat the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis. To date, there are four approved medications, which are mutation-specific. Although the number of mutations that respond to these agents is expanding, effective CFTR modulators are not available to all cystic fibrosis patients. The purpose of this article is to review the approved CFTR modulators and discuss the mutations that can be treated with these agents, as well as, review the long-term benefits of modulator therapy. RECENT FINDINGS:More people with cystic fibrosis can be effectively treated with CFTR modulators. The new, highly effective triple therapy, elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor is indicated for more than 90% of patients with cystic fibrosis and ivacaftor is now approved for children as young as 6 months of age with 1 of 30 CFTR mutations. Long-term use of modulator therapy is associated with fewer pulmonary exacerbations, maintenance of lung function, improved weight gain, and quality of life. SUMMARY:CFTR modulators are the first therapies developed to treat the underlying defect in cystic fibrosis. Their use is associated with preserved lung function and improved health in patients with cystic fibrosis.",0.01669241115450859,False
32678926,"Mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) affect the homeostasis of chloride flux by epithelial cells. This has deleterious consequences, especially in respiratory epithelia, where the defect results in mucus accumulation distinctive of cystic fibrosis. CFTR is, however, also expressed in phagocytic cells, like macrophages. Immune cells are highly sensitive to conditioning by their environment; thus, CFTR dysfunction in epithelia influences macrophages by affecting the lung milieu, but the mutations also appear to be directly consequential for intrinsic macrophage functions. Particular mutations can alter CFTR's folding, traffic of the protein to the membrane and function. As such, understanding the intrinsic effects of CFTR mutation requires distinguishing the secondary effects of misfolded CFTR on cell stress pathways from the primary defect of CFTR dysfunction/absence. Investigations into CFTR's role in macrophages have exploited various models, each with their own advantages and limitations. This review summarizes these methodologic approaches, discussing their physiological correspondence and highlighting key findings. The controversy surrounding CFTR-dependent acidification is used as a case study to highlight difficulties in commensurability across model systems. Recent work in macrophage biology, including polarization and host-pathogen interaction studies, brought into the context of CFTR research, offers potential explanations for observed discrepancies between studies. Moreover, the rapid advancement of novel gene editing technologies and new macrophage model systems makes this assessment of the field's models and methodologies timely.",0.016654647886753082,False
32608531,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES:This study sought to understand the experience of living with cystic fibrosis (CF) as an adult. BACKGROUND:Cystic fibrosis is one of the most difficult chronic diseases to manage long term because of numerous challenges faced on a day-to-day basis. The majority of studies focus on improving symptom response to new treatment regimens with the hope of prolonging life. Yet few qualitative studies explore the experience of adults with CF. What is missing from the current literature are the voices of people living with CF, especially as they age. DESIGN:This study follows a hermeneutic phenomenology design guided by Martin Heidegger's philosophy. METHODS:Semi-structured interviews were conducted with nine adults living with CF. Hermeneutic phenomenology guided the data interpretation. This manuscript follows COREQ reporting guidelines. RESULTS:Hermeneutic analysis revealed the overarching theme The Dance of Cystic Fibrosis which is supported by five themes: (a) the paradox of control, (b) living deaths, (c) dancing with death, (d) relearning to dance, and (e) role of the dance partner. CONCLUSIONS:The experience of living with CF as an adult is multidimensional and unique to each person. Despite the uniqueness, there is a shared experience that manifested as The Dance of Cystic Fibrosis. As life expectancy continues to increase for persons with CF, it is essential that researchers and healthcare professionals intentionally consider the life-prolonging effects of the treatment regimen alongside the persons' experience with those effects. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE:Nurses at all levels of practice should be prepared to address the multifaceted experience of living with CF through thoughtful incorporation of open-ended questions. This allows patients to share their experience with nurses, augmenting their practice of delivering holistic care.",0.01657109335064888,False
32497260,"BACKGROUND:Malabsorption and deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins K may occur in cystic fibrosis, a genetic disorder affecting multiple organs. Vitamin K is known to play an important role in both blood coagulation and bone formation, hence the role of supplementation of vitamin K in this category needs to be reviewed. This is an updated version of the review. OBJECTIVES:To assess the effects of vitamin K supplementation in people with cystic fibrosis and to investigate the hypotheses that vitamin K will decrease deficiency-related coagulopathy, increase bone mineral density, decrease risk of fractures and improve quality of life in people with CF. Also to determine the optimal dose and route of administration of vitamin K for people with CF (for both routine and therapeutic use). SEARCH METHODS:We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Most recent search: 12 August 2019. SELECTION CRITERIA:Randomised controlled trials of all preparations of vitamin K used as a supplement compared to either no supplementation (or placebo) at any dose or route and for any duration, in patients with cystic fibrosis. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS:Two authors independently screened papers, extracted trial details and assessed their risk of bias. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE criteria. MAIN RESULTS:Three trials (total 70 participants, aged 8 to 46 years) assessed as having a moderate risk of bias were included. One trial compared vitamin K to placebo, a second to no supplementation and the third compared two doses of vitamin K. No trial in either comparison reported our primary outcomes of coagulation and quality of life or the secondary outcomes of nutritional parameters and adverse events. Vitamin K versus control Two trials compared vitamin K to control, but data were not available for analysis. One 12-month trial (n = 38) compared 10 mg vitamin K daily or placebo in a parallel design and one trial (n = 18) was of cross-over design with no washout period and compared 5 mg vitamin K/week for four-weeks to no supplementation for four-weeks. Only the 12-month trial reported on the primary outcome of bone formation; we are very uncertain whether vitamin K supplementation has any effect on bone mineral density at the femoral hip or lumbar spine (very low-quality evidence). Both trials reported an increase in serum vitamin K levels and a decrease in undercarboxylated osteocalcin levels. The cross-over trial also reported that levels of proteins induced by vitamin K absence (PIVKA) showed a decrease and a return to normal following supplementation, but due to the very low-quality evidence we are not certain that this is due to the intervention. High-dose versus low-dose vitamin K One parallel trial (n = 14) compared 1 mg vitamin K/day to 5 mg vitamin K/day for four weeks. The trial did report that there did not appear to be any difference in serum undercarboxylated osteocalcin or vitamin K levels (very low-quality evidence). While the trial reported that serum vitamin K levels improved with supplementation, there was no difference between the high-dose and low-dose groups. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS:There is very low-quality evidence of any effect of vitamin K in people with cystic fibrosis. While there is no evidence of harm, until better evidence is available the ongoing recommendations by national CF guidelines should be followed.",0.01612108387053013,False
32671834,"BACKGROUND:Cystic fibrosis is a multi-system disease characterised by the production of thick secretions causing recurrent pulmonary infection, often with unusual bacteria. This leads to lung destruction and eventually death through respiratory failure. There are no antibiotics in development that exert a new mode of action and many of the current antibiotics are ineffective in eradicating the bacteria once chronic infection is established. Antibiotic adjuvants - therapies that act by rendering the organism more susceptible to attack by antibiotics or the host immune system, by rendering it less virulent or killing it by other means, would be a significant therapeutic advance. This is an update of a previously published review. OBJECTIVES:To determine if antibiotic adjuvants improve clinical and microbiological outcome of pulmonary infection in people with cystic fibrosis. SEARCH METHODS:We searched the Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register which is compiled from database searches, hand searches of appropriate journals and conference proceedings. Date of most recent search: 16 January 2020. We also searched MEDLINE (all years) on 14 February 2019 and ongoing trials registers on 06 April 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA:Randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised controlled trials of a therapy exerting an antibiotic adjuvant mechanism of action compared to placebo or no therapy for people with cystic fibrosis. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS:Two of the authors independently assessed and extracted data from identified trials. MAIN RESULTS:We identified 42 trials of which eight (350 participants) that examined antibiotic adjuvant therapies are included. Two further trials are ongoing and five are awaiting classification. The included trials assessed β-carotene (one trial, 24 participants), garlic (one trial, 34 participants), KB001-A (a monoclonal antibody) (two trials, 196 participants), nitric oxide (two trials, 30 participants) and zinc supplementation (two trials, 66 participants). The zinc trials recruited children only, whereas the remaining trials recruited both adults and children. Three trials were located in Europe, one in Asia and four in the USA. Three of the interventions measured our primary outcome of pulmonary exacerbations (β-carotene, mean difference (MD) -8.00 (95% confidence interval (CI) -18.78 to 2.78); KB001-A, risk ratio (RR) 0.25 (95% CI 0.03 to 2.40); zinc supplementation, RR 1.85 (95% CI 0.65 to 5.26). β-carotene and KB001-A may make little or no difference to the number of exacerbations experienced (low-quality evidence); whereas, given the moderate-quality evidence we found that zinc probably makes no difference to this outcome. Respiratory function was measured in all of the included trials. β-carotene and nitric oxide may make little or no difference to forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) (low-quality evidence), whilst garlic probably makes little or no difference to FEV1 (moderate-quality evidence). It is uncertain whether zinc or KB001-A improve FEV1 as the certainty of this evidence is very low. Few adverse events were seen across all of the different interventions and the adverse events that were reported were mild or not treatment-related (quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate). One of the trials (169 participants) comparing KB001-A and placebo, reported on the time to the next course of antibiotics; results showed there is probably no difference between groups, HR 1.00 (95% CI 0.69 to 1.45) (moderate-quality evidence). Quality of life was only reported in the two KB001-A trials, which demonstrated that there may be little or no difference between KB001-A and placebo (low-quality evidence). Sputum microbiology was measured and reported for the trials of KB001-A and nitric oxide (four trials). There was very low-quality evidence of a numerical reduction in Pseudomonas aeruginosa density with KB001-A, but it was not significant. The two trials looking at the effects of nitric oxide reported significant reductions in Staphylococcus aureus and near-significant reductions in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but the quality of this evidence is again very low. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS:We could not identify an antibiotic adjuvant therapy that we could recommend for treating of lung infection in people with cystic fibrosis. The emergence of increasingly resistant bacteria makes the reliance on antibiotics alone challenging for cystic fibrosis teams. There is a need to explore alternative strategies, such as the use of adjuvant therapies. Further research is required to provide future therapeutic options.",0.015996336936950684,False
32703846,"BACKGROUND:Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) do not respond with increased urinary HCO3 - excretion after stimulation with secretin and often present with metabolic alkalosis. METHODS:By combining RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, isolated tubule perfusion, in vitro cell studies, and in vivo studies in different mouse models, we elucidated the mechanism of secretin-induced urinary HCO3 - excretion. For CF patients and CF mice, we developed a HCO3 - drinking test to assess the role of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in urinary HCO3 -excretion and applied it in the patients before and after treatment with the novel CFTR modulator drug, lumacaftor-ivacaftor. RESULTS:β-Intercalated cells express basolateral secretin receptors and apical CFTR and pendrin. In vivo application of secretin induced a marked urinary alkalization, an effect absent in mice lacking pendrin or CFTR. In perfused cortical collecting ducts, secretin stimulated pendrin-dependent Cl-/HCO3 - exchange. In collecting ducts in CFTR knockout mice, baseline pendrin activity was significantly lower and not responsive to secretin. Notably, patients with CF (F508del/F508del) and CF mice showed a greatly attenuated or absent urinary HCO3 --excreting ability. In patients, treatment with the CFTR modulator drug lumacaftor-ivacaftor increased the renal ability to excrete HCO3 -.

32717740,"BACKGROUND:General movements (GMs) in infants occur as fidgety movements (FMs) between postterm 9 and 20 weeks. We aimed to evaluate FMs and motor repertoire in infants with cystic fibrosis (CF) and their relation with clinical findings. METHODS:Demographic and clinical characteristics were recorded. FMs and motor repertoire were analyzed from a 5-min video recording of each infant. Videos were rated based on the Prechtl General Movement Assessment and motor optimality score (MOS) was calculated. RESULTS:The analysis included 18 infants with CF and 20 healthy infants at postterm age of 3-5 months. MOS was significantly lower in the infants with CF compared to controls (p < 0.05). Fifty percent of the infants with CF had abnormal or absent/sporadic FMs. MOS was negatively associated with hospitalization duration (r = -0.378, p = 0.036); and positively associated with vitamin A level in CF infants (r = 0.665, p = 0.026). CONCLUSIONS:Infants with genetically anticipated severe CF phenotype tended to have lower MOS. MOS may be used in addition to genetic testing to predict disease severity in infants with CF. Infants with CF, absent/sporadic FMs, and lower MOS could be considered for planning specific age-adequate early intervention programs. IMPACT:Motor repertoire was age-inadequate in infants with cystic fibrosis (CF).50% of infants with CF had abnormal or absent/sporadic fidgety movements (FMs).Motor optimality score (MOS) was positively associated with vitamin A level and negatively correlated with hospitalization duration in infants with CF.MOS tended to decrease as genetically anticipated disease severity increased; thus, MOS might enable us to predict disease severity in CF. The relationship between motor repertoire and phenotype and genotype is unclear and warrants further study.CF infants with absent/sporadic FMs, and lower MOS could be considered for planning early intervention.",0.013208718039095402,False

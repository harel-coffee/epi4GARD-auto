32518415,"PURPOSE:Cardiac-valvular and vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) have significant cardiovascular issues. The prevalence and significance of such abnormalities in classical (cEDS) or hypermobile EDS (hEDS) remain unclear. We report the prevalence of cardiac abnormalities in patients with cEDS and hEDS. METHODS:We identified 532 pediatric patients with potential EDS evaluated at our institution from January 2014 through April 2019 by retrospective chart review. Ninety-five patients (12 cEDS and 83 hEDS patients) met 2017 EDS diagnostic criteria and had an echocardiogram. One patient was excluded due to complex congenital heart disease, and two were excluded due to lack of images. We reviewed echocardiograms for all structural abnormalities. RESULTS:Of these 95 patients, 1 had mild aortic root dilation, and 1 had mild ascending aorta dilation in the setting of a bicuspid aortic valve. Eleven patients (11.6%) had a cardiac valve abnormality, all of which were trivial to mild. None of the patients required cardiac intervention. CONCLUSION:Our results demonstrate that aortic dilation and valvular anomalies are uncommon in cEDS or hEDS patients. Given the lack of evidence, we do not recommend echocardiographic evaluation and surveillance in patients with cEDS and hEDS in the absence of clinical findings or positive family history.",0.9973160624504089,True
31947929,"Ehlers-Danlos Syndromes (EDS) are a group of heritable disorders of connective tissue (HDCT) characterized by joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility, and tissue fragility. Orthostatic intolerance (OI) is highly prevalent in EDS however mechanisms linking OI to EDS remain poorly understood. We hypothesize that impaired blood pressure (BP) and heart rate control is associated with lower arterial stiffness in people with EDS. Orthostatic vital signs and arterial stiffness were assessed in a cohort of 60 people with EDS (49 female, 36 ± 16 years). Arterial elasticity was assessed by central and peripheral pulse wave velocity (PWV). Central PWV was lower in people with EDS compared to reference values in healthy subjects. In participants with EDS, central PWV was correlated to supine systolic BP (r = 0.387, p = 0.002), supine diastolic BP (r = 0.400, p = 0.002), and seated systolic BP (r = 0.399, p = 0.002). There were no significant correlations between PWV and changes in BP or heart rate with standing (p > 0.05). Between EDS types, there were no differences in supine hemodynamics or PWV measures (p > 0.05). These data demonstrate that increased arterial elasticity is associated with lower BP in people with EDS which may contribute to orthostatic symptoms and potentially provides a quantitative clinical measure for future genotype-phenotype investigations.",0.9931424856185913,True
32654548,"PURPOSE:Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) is an inherited connective tissue disorder caused by abnormal collagen synthesis. Little is known about its effects on pregnancy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the pregnancy outcomes in women with EDS. MATERIALS AND METHODS:We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study using the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Nationwide Inpatient Sample database from the United States. The study included women who delivered between 1999 and 2014. We measured the prevalence of EDS over time, and compared the baseline, obstetrical, and neonatal outcomes among women with EDS to the general obstetrical population without EDS. Unconditional logistic regression models were used to calculate the adjusted effect of EDS on maternal and neonatal outcomes. RESULTS:The overall prevalence of EDS in pregnancy was 7 per 100,000 births, with the trend increasing over the 16 year study period (p < .0001). Women with EDS were more likely to be Caucasian, belong to a higher income quartile, and smoke. Pregnancies in women with EDS were associated with prematurity, 1.47 (1.18-1.82), cervical incompetence, 3.11 (1.99-4.85), antepartum hemorrhage, 1.71 (1.16-2.50), placenta previa, 2.26 (1.35-3.77) and maternal death, 9.04 (1.27-64.27). Pregnant women with EDS were more likely to be delivered by cesarean section, 1.55 (1.36-1.76), have longer postpartum stays (>7 days), 2.82 (2.08-3.85), and have a neonate with intra-uterine growth restriction, 1.81 (1.29-2.54). CONCLUSIONS:EDS in pregnancy is a high-risk condition with increased maternal morbidity and mortality, as well as newborn morbidity. Consideration should be given to prematurity preventative measures and high-risk pregnancy consultation.",0.3834567368030548,False

However, there are limited published data on the dental manifestations of EDS. This review systematically assessed the spectrum of published dental anomalies in various types of EDS. Twenty-four individual case reports/series and 3 longer case-control studies, reporting on a total of 84 individuals with a clinical diagnosis of EDS, were included in the data analysis. The main dental features listed in classical EDS were pulp calcification and localized root hypoplasia. Common dental abnormalities observed in vascular EDS were pulp shape modifications (52.2%), exceeding root length (34.8%), and molar root fusion (47.8%).

32170975,"Classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is a connective tissue disorder characterized by laxity. The skin, as one of the organs involved, shows hyperextensibility, which makes it prone to trauma. In this context, it would seem logical for cutaneous synovial metaplasia, which is considered a form of repair, to be commonly found in cases of EDS. However, there are only two previously published cases of synovial metaplasia in EDS. We present a third case in a 56-year-old woman with painful redundant skin in both elbows and knees for whom a skin fold of the left elbow was removed to relieve her symptoms. The biopsy showed preservation of the elastic and collagen fibers. The main alteration was the evidence of dermal cystic spaces lined by fibrinoid rests with focal pseudopapillary projections. However, in some zones the cellular lining was preserved, and it was composed of vimentin-positive, fibroblast-like flat, elongated cells, as well as CD68-positive macrophages.

32467296,"BACKGROUND:The Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) are a group of connective tissue disorders with several recognised types. Patients with a type of EDS have connective tissue abnormalities resulting in a varying degree of joint hypermobility, skin and vascular fragility and generalised tissue friability. Classical EDS (cEDS) typically occurs as a result of dominant pathogenic variants in COL5A1 or COL5A2. The cardinal features of cEDS are hyperextensible skin, atrophic scarring and joint hypermobility. Arterial complications are more characteristically a feature of vascular EDS although individual cases of arterial events in cEDS have been reported. METHODS:A cohort of 154 patients with a clinical diagnosis of cEDS from the UK was analysed. RESULTS:Seven patients (4.5%) with a diagnosis of cEDS (four pathogenic, one likely pathogenic and two variants of uncertain significance in COL5A1) who had experienced arterial complications were identified. Arterial complications mostly involved medium-sized vessels and also two abdominal aortic aneurysms. No unique clinical features were identified in this group of patients. CONCLUSION:There is a possible increased risk of arterial complications in patients with cEDS, although not well-defined. Clinicians need to be aware of this possibility when presented with a patient with an arterial complication and features of cEDS. Long-term management in families with cEDS and a vascular complication should be individually tailored to the patient's history and their family's history of vascular events.",0.08640776574611664,False
32414079,"Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) are a group of heritable connective tissue disorders (HCTDs) characterized by a variable degree of skin hyperextensibility, joint hypermobility and tissue fragility. The current EDS classification distinguishes 13 subtypes and 19 different causal genes mainly involved in collagen and extracellular matrix synthesis and maintenance. EDS need to be differentiated from other HCTDs with a variable clinical overlap including Marfan syndrome and related disorders, some types of skeletal dysplasia and cutis laxa. Clinical recognition of EDS is not always straightforward and for a definite diagnosis, molecular testing can be of great assistance, especially in patients with an uncertain phenotype. Currently, the major challenging task in EDS is to unravel the molecular basis of the hypermobile EDS that is the most frequent form, and for which the diagnosis is only clinical in the absence of any definite laboratory test. This EDS subtype, as well as other EDS-reminiscent phenotypes, are currently investigated worldwide to unravel the primary genetic defect and related pathomechanisms. The research articles, case report, and reviews published in this Special Issue focus on different clinical, genetic and molecular aspects of several EDS subtypes and some related disorders, offering novel findings and future research and nosological perspectives.",0.06213529407978058,False

32423364,"OBJECTIVES:Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome represent two connective tissue vascular diseases requiring unique consideration in their vascular surgical care. A comprehensive national review encompassing all hospitalizations for the Marfan Syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome patient population is lacking. METHODS:The National (Nationwide) Inpatient Sample from 2010 to 2014 was reviewed for all inpatient vascular surgery procedures including those with a diagnosis of Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. National estimates of vascular surgery rates were generated from provided weights. Patient demographics, procedure type, and outcomes were assessed. RESULTS:There were 3103 Marfan syndrome and 476 Ehlers-Danlos syndrome vascular procedures identified as well as 3,895,381 vascular procedures in the remainder of population (control group). The percent of aortic procedures from all vascular procedures in Marfan syndrome (23.5%) and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (23.5%) were 2.5-fold higher than controls (9.1%), p < 0.0001. Open aortic aneurysm repair was also significantly greater in both Marfan syndrome (16.8%) and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (11.2%) compared to controls (4.4%), p < 0.0001. Endovascular aortic repair (p < 0.2302) was similar among the groups. Marfan syndrome (7.7%) and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (5.1%) had more thoracic endovascular aortic repair performed than controls (0.7%), p < 0.0001. Percutaneous procedures were fewer in Marfan syndrome (6.3%) than controls (31.3%) and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (26.3%), p < 0.0001, while repair of peripheral arteries was greater in Marfan syndrome (5.9%) and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (4.1%) than controls (1.5%), p < 0.0001. For total aortic procedures, the mean age of aortic procedures was 68.2 years in controls vs 45.8 years in Marfan syndrome and 55.3 years in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, p < 0.0001. Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome had fewer comorbidities overall, while controls had significantly higher rates of coronary artery disease (controls 39.9% vs Marfan syndrome 8.3% and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome 13.0%, p < 0.0001), peripheral vascular disease (controls 34.5% vs Marfan syndrome 4.2% and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome 8.7%, p < 0.0001), and diabetes (controls 20.6% vs Marfan syndrome 6.6 and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome 4.4%, p < 0.0001). Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome had higher overall complication rate (65.5% and 52.2%) compared to controls (44.6%), p < 0.0001. Postoperative hemorrhage was more likely in Marfan syndrome (42.9%) and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (39.1%) than controls (22.2%), p < 0.0001. Increased respiratory failure was noted in Marfan syndrome (20.2%) vs controls (10.7%) and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (8.7%), p = .0003. Finally, length of stay was increased in Marfan syndrome 12.5 days vs Ehlers-Danlos syndrome 7.4 days and controls 7.2 days (p < 0.0001) as well as a higher median costs of index hospitalization in Marfan syndrome ($57,084 vs Ehlers-Danlos syndrome $22,032 and controls $26,520, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS:Patients with Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome differ from other patients undergoing vascular surgical procedures, with a significantly higher proportion of aortic procedures including open aneurysm repair and thoracic endovascular aortic repair. While they are younger with fewer comorbidities, due to the unique pathogenesis of their underlying connective tissue disorder, there is an overall higher rate of procedural complications and increased length of stay and cost for Marfan syndrome patients undergoing aortic surgery.",0.028199614956974983,False

32709178,"BACKGROUND:Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is a multifaceted disease that can present with a variety of types of pain. Unfortunately, both the mechanisms and treatments for pain are poorly understood. The proposed treatments for the various musculoskeletal pain syndromes in EDS have had variable success, and it becomes much more imperative to better define and evaluate the current treatment modalities in treating this debilitating disease. OBJECTIVES:The purpose of this study was to investigate the currently available treatment modalities for patients with EDS and their efficacies in pain and symptom relief. STUDY DESIGN:Retrospective cohort study. SETTING:Institutional physical medicine and rehabilitation primary care clinic. METHODS:All patients were seen between January 2015 and April 2019, in which 98 patients with EDS were identified through retrospective chart review. Institutional review board approval was obtained, and all patients provided written consent to be included in the study. We reviewed various treatment modalities, including complimentary/alternative treatments, opioids/opioid-like medications, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, physical therapy, occupational therapy, muscle relaxants, neuropathic modulators, steroids, surgery/procedures, and acetaminophen. Treatment methods were extracted from individual patient charts, and efficacy was grouped into 3 categories: improvement, no effect, or worsened symptoms. RESULTS:The most common treatments used were complimentary/alternative treatments (n = 88). Occupational therapy and bracing were the most effective options with 70% of patients reporting improvement. Neuropathic modulators were the least well tolerated with 47% of patients reporting adverse effects. LIMITATIONS:Men were a small percentage of the study. Patients were not randomized, and pain score reporting was subjective. Patient data were extracted from a single practice setting. Timing and symptom onset were not measured. CONCLUSIONS:There is a relative paucity of published literature regarding the various treatment methods for EDS. Although our study is able to identify positive and negative trends with certain modalities, it is vital to understand that EDS is not a uniform diagnosis among patients, and that a combination of several different treatments usually is needed for optimal symptom control. Further research and investigation are necessary to develop a comprehensive treatment database for this complex condition.

32162201,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW:To summarize the bone findings, mainly bone mass and fracture risk, in Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS). RECENT FINDINGS:Low bone mineral density and fractures seem to be frequent in some of the rare EDS types (kyphoscoliotic, arthrochalasia, spondylodysplastic, and classic-like EDS). For the more prevalent hypermobile and classic EDS types, some case-control studies found mildly decreased bone mineral density, but it was not clear that fracture rates were increased. Nevertheless, abnormalities in vertebral shape seem to be common in classical and hypermobile EDS types. In a cohort of individuals with EDS followed since birth, no fractures were observed during infancy. Bone mineral density varies widely among the different types of EDS, and vertebral abnormalities seem to be common in classical and hypermobile EDS. It might be justified to perform spine radiographs and bone mineral density assessments in newly diagnosed EDS.",0.02033044397830963,False
32399126,"Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is a connective tissue disorder characterized by joint hypermobility and skin extensibility and is often accompanied by chronic pain. Rhythmic sensory stimulation (RSS) can be defined as the stimulation of the senses in a periodic manner within a range of low frequencies. Music plus sound delivered through a vibroacoustic device is a form of RSS and has demonstrated utility in managing pain. In this current study, we conducted an open-label pilot study of 15 patients with hypermobile EDS using RSS as the intervention. Posttreatment improvements were seen in 11 of the 15 patients (73%), whereas 3 of the 15 patients (20%) experienced worse outcomes. Of the 14 patients that completed the experiment, 6 participants (43%) were classified as ""responders"" to the device while 8 participants (57%) were classified as ""nonresponders."" Responders demonstrated significant improvements in pain interference (51.5 ± 16 preintervention vs. 43.5 ± 16.4 postintervention BPI score) and depression symptoms (34.0 ± 15.9 preintervention vs. 26.8 ± 12.1 postintervention CESD score). Poststudy interviews confirm the improvements of pain interference, mood, and bowel symptoms. Furthermore, analysis of medical conditions within the responder group indicates that the presence of depression, anxiety, irritable bowel syndrome, and fibromyalgia may indicate a greater likelihood for patients to benefit with vibroacoustic applications. These results indicate a possible potential for RSS, delivered using a vibroacoustic device, in managing pain-related symptoms.

32693780,"BACKGROUND:Patients with vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) occasionally suffer from arterial dissection. Eagle syndrome, which is caused by an elongated styloid process and also causes arterial dissection, is difficult to diagnose and could sometimes be overlooked. Little is known of the coexistence of these two diseases, and treatment strategy is not established. Here, we present a case of bilateral internal carotid artery (ICA) dissection due to Eagle syndrome in a patient with vascular EDS. CASE PRESENTATION:A 30-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of sudden onset of mild sensory disturbance in his left limbs. He had a history of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) and also had left cervical internal carotid artery (ICA) dissection 3 years before. Diffusion-weighted imaging showed acute cerebral infarcts in the right hemisphere. Cervical computed tomography angiography (CTA) revealed the right ICA narrowing at the cervical portion in addition to the previous left cervical ICA dissection. Cervical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed double-lumen and intramural hematoma at the narrowing portion of the right cervical ICA, which indicates arterial dissection. CT also revealed bilateral elongated styloid processes which are close to each side of cervical ICA. We diagnosed him as bilateral ICA dissection due to bilateral Eagle syndrome. Considering vascular complications due to vascular EDS, we performed closer follow-up with transoral carotid ultrasonography (TOCU). In 4 months, his right ICA dissection gradually improved without stroke recurrence or deterioration of dissection. CONCLUSIONS:Since patients with vascular EDS easily develop arterial dissection, Eagle syndrome may be overlooked. Clinicians should consider Eagle syndrome in the case of vascular EDS with extracranial ICA dissection and close follow-up should be prioritized in cases of Eagle syndrome with vascular EDS.",0.015470676124095917,False
31989797,"BACKGROUND:Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) is a rare disease affecting approximately 1 in 5,000 people. Although ophthalmic conditions associated with EDS have been described, little data exist concerning ophthalmic surgical outcomes experienced by EDS patients. METHODS:Patients with EDS were surveyed via the EDS Society and asked about their ophthalmic surgical experiences including procedure, complications, and the timing with respect to receiving the EDS diagnosis. Complications were confirmed as such by subspecialists. RESULTS:Of 579 respondents, 467 reported confirmed EDS, and 112 of those had an ophthalmic procedure, including refractive surgery, cataract/lens surgery, retinal surgery, strabismus surgery, oculoplastic surgery, corneal surgery, and laser surgery for glaucoma. The rate of confirmed complications was: 23%-refractive, 33%-lens/cataract, 33%-retina, 59%-strabismus, 23%- oculoplastics, 0%-cornea, and 25%-glaucoma laser. In addition, 76% of patients underwent surgery prior to the EDS diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS:Patients with EDS may have elevated risk of postoperative ophthalmic surgical complications. It would seem reasonable to systemically and prospectively explore how patients with EDS respond to ophthalmic surgery. Furthermore, it would seem circumspect to ask surgical candidates patients about whether they carry a diagnosis of EDS or have signs and symptoms of EDS prior to surgery.",0.01490323431789875,False

EDS patients have a high susceptibility for developing anastomotic leak after visceral surgery. Although patients with EDS can also develop severe obesity and might be referred to bariatric surgery, there is just 1 case report in the literature regarding the outcomes of bariatric surgery in this specific context. OBJECTIVE:To report the cases of patients with EDS and severe obesity that underwent bariatric surgery. SETTING:Five French hospitals (University Hospital of Nantes, APHP Pitié Salpêtrière Hospital, APHP Bichat Hospital, Clinique St Gregoire Rennes, and Clinique Mutualiste de l'Estuaire St Nazaire). METHODS:We report the cases of 7 patients with EDS and severe obesity who underwent surgery. RESULTS:All patients showed classical postoperative course except for 1 case of excessive bleeding. There was no increased pain, leak, and solid parietal healing was achieved in all patients at 1 month postoperatively. The percent excess weight loss at 1 and 6 months were 13.9 ± 3.8% and 45.3 ± 16%, respectively.

Her trachea was easily intubated with a videolaryngoscope despite a small mouth and micrognathia. Pressure-controlled ventilation with limited peak inspiratory pressure was performed for prevention of pneumothorax. Skin damage and joint luxation were prevented by using a low rebounding mattress, terpolymer-based barrier film, and careful patient positioning.

32721506,"BACKGROUND:Surgical management of shoulder instability in patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) remains challenging secondary to the pathologic nature of their connective tissue. Allograft reconstruction of the shoulder capsule in EDS has the potential to increase stability by providing healthier connective tissue. The purpose of this study was to report the surgical technique and outcome of open capsulorraphy and augmentation of the anterior capsule with Achilles tendon allograft in patients with shoulder instability in the setting of EDS. METHODS:Five shoulders (4 patients) with EDS and severe anteroinferior or multidirectional instability underwent open capsular shift combined with Achilles allograft augmentation of the anterior capsule. Patients were evaluated for pain, motion, recurrent instability, subjective shoulder value (SSV), ASES score, complications and reoperations. The mean follow-up time was 3.6 years (range, 2 to 5 years). RESULTS:Shoulder stability was restored in 4 of 5 (80%) shoulders. At final follow-up, the mean SSV and ASES scores were 84 and 77.3, respectively. One shoulder developed recurrent posterior instability after an injury 1.6 years after the index procedure. The mean pain VAS was 7 preoperatively and 2 at most recent follow-up. Before surgery, all patients reported use of narcotic pain medication, whereas at most recent follow-up only the one patient who had experienced recurrence reported moderate pain. Except for the shoulder that required revision surgery for posterior shoulder instability, there were no complications or other reoperations. CONCLUSION:Open capsulorraphy with Achilles Allograft augmentation improved stability and pain 4 of 5 shoulders with instability in the setting of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. In this small case series of EDS patients, Achilles tendon allograft augmentation was safe and effective as a primary or revision surgical procedure for anterior shoulder instability.

32520675,"Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is an inherited disorder of red blood cells that is caused by a single mutation in the βglobin gene. The disease, which afflicts millions of patients worldwide mainly in low income countries, is characterized by high morbidity, mortality and low life expectancy. The new pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies for SCD is urgent in order to promote treatments able to reduce patient's suffering and improve their quality of life. Since the FDA approval of HU in 1998, there have been few advances in discovering new drugs; however, in the last three years voxelotor, crizanlizumab, and glutamine have been approved as new therapeutic alternatives. In addition, new promising compounds have been described to treat the main SCD symptoms. Herein, focusing on drug discovery, we discuss new strategies to treat SCD that have been carried out in the last ten years to discover new, safe, and effective treatments. Moreover, nonpharmacological approaches, including red blood cell exchange, gene therapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation will be presented.",0.9927372336387634,True
32387142,"Sickle cell disease is an inherited disorder that affects more than 100,000 individuals in the United States and results in a shortened life span. Characterized by the production of abnormal, sickle-shaped hemoglobin, the disease is marked by anemia, vaso-occlusion of blood vessels, and tissue damage. In November 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved voxelotor (Oxbryta) as a novel treatment for sickle cell disease. Voxelotor inhibits the production of sickle hemoglobin and improves anemia. This article presents an overview of voxelotor, including adverse effects, use in special populations, and implications for nursing practice.",0.9909778833389282,True
32702096,"Recurrent ischemic priapism is a common complication of sickle cell disease (SCD). We assessed the burden, characteristics, and types of priapism, including sexual dysfunction, in a cohort of men with and those without SCD, to test the hypothesis that sexual dysfunction is more prevalent in men with SCD. In Kano, Nigeria, we conducted a comparative cross-sectional survey that included 500 and 250 men 18 to 40 years of age, with and without SCD, respectively. The survey used the Priapism Questionnaire and the International Index of Erectile Function for sexual function assessment. All eligible participants approached for the study gave informed consent and were enrolled. Stuttering and major priapism were defined based on the average duration of priapism experiences that lasted ≤4 and >4 hours, respectively. The prevalence of priapism was significantly higher in men with SCD than in those without it (32.6% vs 2%; P < .001). Stuttering priapism accounted for 73.6% of the priapism episodes in men with SCD. Nearly 50% of the participants with SCD-related priapism had never sought medical attention for this complication. The majority of the men with SCD-related priapism used exercise as a coping mechanism. Priapism affected the self-image of the men with SCD, causing sadness, embarrassment, and fear. The percentage of the men with SCD who had erectile dysfunction was more than twofold higher than that of those without SCD who had erectile dysfunction (P = .01). The men with SCD had a higher prevalence of priapism and sexual dysfunction than the men without SCD.",0.88177889585495,True
32674605,"Objective: To review the pharmacological characteristics, clinical evidence, and place in therapy of voxelotor for the treatment of sickle cell disease (SCD). Data Sources: A comprehensive literature search of PubMed (1966 to April 2020) was conducted. Key search terms included GBT440, sickle cell, and voxelotor. Other sources were derived from bibliographies of articles, product labeling, manufacturer's website, and news releases. ClinicalTrials.gov was searched for additional studies. Study Selection and Data Extraction: All English-language articles identified from the data sources were reviewed and evaluated. Case reports/series and phase 1 through 3 clinical trials were included. Data Synthesis: SCD is an inherited disorder associated with significant morbidity and early mortality. Three medications approved for SCD reduce SCD-associated complications but do not selectively ameliorate the underlying disease. Voxelotor is a novel agent that targets the pathophysiology of SCD. A phase 3 trial reported an increase in mean Hb level from baseline for voxelotor compared with placebo (1.1 vs -0.1 g/dL; P < 0.001). Voxelotor is generally well tolerated, with common adverse effects including headache, diarrhea, nausea, and arthralgia. Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: Voxelotor may be considered for patients with SCD who have continued anemia and hemolysis despite being on maximum tolerated dose of hydroxyurea or in those who are hydroxyurea intolerant. Voxelotor is costly; therefore, both cost and benefit should be weighed before prescribing. Conclusion: Voxelotor appears to be safe and effective as monotherapy or in combination with hydroxyurea for patients with SCD who are 12 years of age and older.",0.5574682950973511,True
32548653,"The term ""sickle cell disease"" covers a group of genetic blood disorders caused by sickle hemoglobin (HbS) alone or in combination with other variants of the β‑globin locus. Sickle cell disease occurs frequently in sub-Saharan Africa, but is also common in Turkey, Greece, Sicily, the Middle East, India, and the Americas. Polymerization of deoxygenated sickle hemoglobin leads to decreased deformability of red blood cells. These altered erythrocytes can obstruct small blood vessels and cause acute episodes of pain, hemolytic anemia, and organ damage. Complications can vary between the different genotypes and it is important to be aware of the special features of the disease. Hydroxycarbamide has been shown to reduce the morbidity and mortality of patients with sickle cell disease. New drugs and novel treatment approaches such as gene therapy are currently being tested.",0.07058743387460709,False
32462802,"BACKGROUND:Sickle cell disease (SCD) is relatively common in Bahrain, and airway inflammation in patients with SCD is usually multifactorial. This study aimed to evaluate lung function and induced sputum levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in Bahraini children and adolescents with SCD and assess their relationship with the recurrence of acute chest syndrome (ACS). METHODS:A total of 139 children and adolescents with SCD and 123 healthy children (control group) were included in the present study. Patients were further stratified according to age and history of ACS. The patient and control groups underwent pulmonary function tests (PFTs), including spirometry and assessments of lung volume, diffusion of carbon monoxide (DLCO), and induced sputum IL-6 levels. RESULTS:Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1 ), force vital capacity (FVC), FEV1 /FVC, total lung capacity, DLCO, and DLCOc (ie, hemoglobin-corrected DLCO) were significantly lower, while residual volume and sputum IL-6 levels were significantly higher in the patient group than in the control group. PFT parameters were more compromised in the patient subgroup with a history of ACS and older than 12 years compared with the subgroup without a history of ACS and the subgroup under 12 years of age. PFTs revealed significant negative correlations with age, number of ACS events, and sputum IL-6 levels. CONCLUSION:Pulmonary function was observed to worsen with disease progression, and it worsened with older age and repeated occurrence of ACS. Induced sputum IL-6 levels reflected the degree of lung inflammation in affected patients and were associated with more impairment in various PFT parameters.",0.0420573465526104,False
32614473,"BACKGROUND:Sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the commonest severe monogenic disorders in the world, due to the inheritance of two abnormal haemoglobin (beta globin) genes. SCD can cause severe pain, significant end-organ damage, pulmonary complications, and premature death. Surgical interventions are more common in people with SCD, and occur at much younger ages than in the general population. Blood transfusions are frequently used prior to surgery and several regimens are used but there is no consensus over the best method or the necessity of transfusion in specific surgical cases. This is an update of a Cochrane Review. OBJECTIVES:To determine whether there is evidence that preoperative blood transfusion in people with SCD undergoing elective or emergency surgery reduces mortality and perioperative or sickle cell-related serious adverse events. To compare the effectiveness of different transfusion regimens (aggressive or conservative) if preoperative transfusions are indicated in people with SCD. SEARCH METHODS:We searched for relevant trials in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the Transfusion Evidence Library (from 1980), and ongoing trial databases; all searches current to 28 January 2020 We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register: 19 September 2019. SELECTION CRITERIA:All randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing preoperative blood transfusion regimens to different regimens or no transfusion in people with SCD undergoing elective or emergency surgery. There was no restriction by outcomes examined, language or publication status. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS:Two authors independently assessed trial eligibility and the risk of bias and extracted data. MAIN RESULTS:Three trials with 990 participants were eligible for inclusion in the review. There were no ongoing trials identified. These trials were conducted between 1988 and 2011. The majority of people included had haemoglobin (Hb) SS SCD. The majority of surgical procedures were considered low or intermediate risk for developing sickle cell-related complications. Aggressive versus simple red blood cell transfusions One trial (551 participants) compared an aggressive transfusion regimen (decreasing sickle haemoglobin to less than 30%) to a simple transfusion regimen (increasing haemoglobin to 100 g/L). This trial re-randomised participants and therefore quantitative analysis was only possible on two subsets of data: participants undergoing cholecystectomy (230 participants); and participants undergoing tonsillectomy or adenoidectomy surgeries (107 participants). Data were not combined as we do not know if any participant received both surgeries. Overall, the quality of the evidence was very low across different outcomes according to GRADE methodology. This was due to the trial being at high risk of bias primarily due to lack of blinding, indirectness and the outcome estimates being imprecise. Cholecystectomy subgroup results are reported in the abstract. Results for both subgroups were similar. There was no difference in all-cause mortality between people receiving aggressive transfusions and those receiving conservative transfusions. No deaths occurred in either subgroup. There were no differences between the aggressive transfusion group and conservative transfusion group in the number of people developing: • an acute chest syndrome, risk ratio (RR) 0.84 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.38 to 1.84) (one trial, 230 participants, very low-quality evidence); • vaso-occlusive crisis, risk ratio 0.30 (95% CI 0.09 to 1.04) (one trial, 230 participants, very low quality evidence); • serious infection, risk ratio 1.75 (95% CI 0.59 to 5.18) (one trial, 230 participants, very low-quality evidence); • any perioperative complications, RR 0.75 (95% CI 0.36 to 1.55) (one trial, 230 participants, very low-quality evidence); • a transfusion-related complication, RR 1.85 (95% CI 0.89 to 3.88) (one trial, 230 participants, very low-quality evidence). Preoperative transfusion versus no preoperative transfusion Two trials (434 participants) compared a preoperative transfusion plus standard care to a group receiving standard care. Overall, the quality of the evidence was low to very low across different outcomes according to GRADE methodology. This was due to the trials being at high risk of bias due to lack of blinding, and outcome estimates being imprecise. One trial was stopped early because more people in the no transfusion arm developed an acute chest syndrome. There was no difference in all-cause mortality between people receiving preoperative transfusions and those receiving no preoperative transfusions (two trials, 434 participants, no deaths occurred). There was significant heterogeneity between the two trials in the number of people developing an acute chest syndrome, a meta-analysis was therefore not performed. One trial showed a reduced number of people developing acute chest syndrome between people receiving preoperative transfusions and those receiving no preoperative transfusions, risk ratio 0.11 (95% confidence interval 0.01 to 0.80) (65 participants), whereas the other trial did not, RR 4.81 (95% CI 0.23 to 99.61) (369 participants). There were no differences between the preoperative transfusion groups and the groups without preoperative transfusion in the number of people developing: • a vaso-occlusive crisis, Peto odds ratio (OR) 1.91 (95% confidence interval 0.61 to 6.04) (two trials, 434 participants, very low-quality evidence). • a serious infection, Peto OR 1.29 (95% CI 0.29 to 5.71) (two trials, 434 participants, very low-quality evidence); • any perioperative complications, RR 0.24 (95% CI 0.03 to 2.05) (one trial, 65 participants, low-quality evidence). There was an increase in the number of people developing circulatory overload in those receiving preoperative transfusions compared to those not receiving preoperative transfusions in one of the two trials, and no events were seen in the other trial (no meta-analysis performed). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS:There is insufficient evidence from randomised trials to determine whether conservative preoperative blood transfusion is as effective as aggressive preoperative blood transfusion in preventing sickle-related or surgery-related complications in people with HbSS disease. There is very low quality evidence that preoperative blood transfusion may prevent development of acute chest syndrome. Due to lack of evidence this review cannot comment on management for people with HbSC or HbSβ+ disease or for those with high baseline haemoglobin concentrations.",0.029083363711833954,False
32394268,"The objective of this study was to analyze acute care utilization of sickle cell disease (SCD) and sickle cell trait (SCT) in children and identify trends in emergency department (ED) visits and inpatient admissions over a 10-year period. This is a retrospective population-based study of SCD- and SCT-related ED visits and admissions from 2006 to 2015. Data were acquired from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP), National Inpatient Sample (NIS), and National Emergency Department Sample (NEDS) database. Cost-to-charge and estimated professional fee ratios were applied to approximate costs. Over 80% of medical expenditure on HbSS is through ED-based admissions. There is a statistically significant increase from 2006 to 2015 in the direct hospital admissions associated with patients less than 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with SCT.Conclusion: Among patients less than 18 years of age with HbSS, inpatient admissions through the emergency department accounted for the largest medical expenditure of the SCD subtypes.What is Known:• There are currently no multi-year, nationwide analyses of acute care utilization in sickle cell disease and sickle cell trait (SCT) in the pediatric population.• SCT is more common than SCD, affecting 1.5% of all infants born in the USA.What is New:• Comprehensive annual costs of acute care utilization of patients less than 18 years of age with SCD and SCT in the USA which includes aggregated demographical patient care data and to illustrate temporal trends of acute care utilization in children less than 18 years of age with SCD and SCT• Among patients less than 18 years of age with HbSS, inpatient admissions through the emergency department accounted for the largest medical expenditure of the sickle cell disease subtypes.",0.026886628940701485,False

Nine hundred and seventy-three (46.1%; 95% CI: 44.0-48.2) and 37.9% (95% CI: 35.9-40.0) subjects indicated, respectively, that SCD is an acquired and hereditary disease. Moreover, 53.6% (95% CI: 51.5-55.7) said that the diagnosis of SCD is made by blood tests, while 46.2% (95% CI: 44.1-48.3) talked about urine tests. About 85.6% were unaware of the risk of children becoming sickle cell patients when both parents have SCD. To prevent SCD, pre-marital screening was cited by only 7.7% (95% CI: 6.6-8.9) of subjects and no measure was known by 25.4% (95% CI: 23.6-27.3). However, 79.6% (95% CI: 77.8-81.3) approved the need of pre-marital screening of SCD.Discussion: This study highlighted that the Kisangani university students' knowledge regarding SCD is poor and needs to be improved; education programs and motivational campaigns to be enhanced.",0.02168966643512249,False

32362160,"INTRODUCTION:In sickle cell disease (SCD), hemoglobin S (HbS) red blood cells (RBCs) are characteristically deformed and inflexible. Often breaking down in the circulation, they exhibit increased adhesive properties with the endothelium and activated neutrophils and platelets, increasing the risk of occlusion of the microcirculation. SCD is categorized into two sub-phenotypes: hyperhemolytic, associated with priapism, leg ulcers, pulmonary hypertension, and stroke, and high hemoglobin/viscosity, which may promote vaso-occlusion-associated pain, acute chest syndrome, and osteonecrosis. AREAS COVERED:The sub-phenotypes are not completely distinct. Hemolysis may trigger vaso-occlusion, contributing to vascular complications. Targeting P-selectin, a key mediator of cross-talk between hyperhemolysis and vaso-occlusion, may be beneficial for vascular and vaso-occlusion-associated complications. English-language articles from PubMed on the topic of SCD and vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs) were reviewed from 1 January 2000 to 1 January 2019 using the search terms 'sickle cell disease,' 'vaso-occlusive crises,' and 'selectin.' EXPERT OPINION:Besides targeting P-selectin, other strategies to counter VOCs and RBC sickling are being pursued. These include platelet inhibition to counter aggregation, intercellular adhesion, and thrombosis during VOCs; gene therapy to correct the homozygous missense mutation in the β-globin gene, causing polymerization of HbS; L-glutamine, possibly reducing oxidative stress in sickled RBCs; and fetal hemoglobin inducers.",0.016781730577349663,False
32722421,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is an important cause of vascular morbidity and mortality. Many risk factors have been identified for venous thrombosis that lead to alterations in blood flow, activate the vascular endothelium, and increase the propensity for blood coagulation. However, the precise molecular and cellular mechanisms that cause blood clots in the venous vasculature have not been fully elucidated. Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) demonstrate all the risk factors for venous stasis, activated endothelium, and blood hypercoagulability, making them particularly vulnerable to VTE. In this review, we will discuss how mouse models have elucidated the complex vascular pathobiology of SCD. We review the dysregulated pathways of inflammation and coagulation in SCD and how the resultant hypercoagulable state can potentiate thrombosis through down-regulation of vascular anticoagulants. Studies of VTE pathogenesis using SCD mouse models may provide insight into the intersection between the cellular and molecular processes involving inflammation and coagulation and help to identify novel mechanistic pathways.",0.016706237569451332,False
32572524,"Sickle hepatopathy is a severe and not rare complication of sickle cell disease (SCD), showing mainly a cholestatic pattern. So far, no effective approaches to prevent or treat this condition have been recognized. We conducted a single-center observational study in 68 adult sickle cell patients, encompassing 17 with sickle cell anemia (SCA), 38 with sickle cell thalassemia (HbS/β-Thal), and 13 with HbSC disease. The aim of our study was to assess liver damage in the three main forms of SCD, through the evaluation of clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings. In our population, the role of hepatotropic viruses, high BMI, and alcohol consumption in liver damage was ruled out. SCA and HbS/β-Thal patients with lower Hb (p < 0.001), higher HbS (p < 0.001), and frequent vaso-occlusive crises showed functional (GGT values: SCA and HbS/β-Thal vs HbSC p = 0.047 and p = 0.009, respectively) and structural liver abnormalities, defined by abdominal ultrasound and vibration-controlled transient elastography (liver stiffness values: SCA and HbS/β-Thal vs HbSC p 0.022 and p 0.19, respectively), more severe than HbSC patients. Through univariate and multivariate analyses, male sex, SCA genotype, lower HbF, frequent transfusions, increased GGT values, and abnormal liver ultrasound and stiffness were identified as potentially early markers of sickle hepatopathy.",0.016521025449037552,False

Antioxidants are studied in SCD due to their potential to ensure redox balance and minimize deleterious effects on erythrocyte membranes. The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the efficacy of antioxidant nutrient supplementation on reducing hemolysis in SCD patients through randomized clinical trials. We conducted our study according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses and the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions investigating whether antioxidants could improve the hemolytic status of SCD patients. This study included 587 articles published until April 2020. We reduced this pool to 12 articles by excluding duplicates, reviews, comments, and studies with non-human subjects. Omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin A, and zinc were the antioxidants that reportedly improved the indirect hemolysis parameters such as hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume, or red blood cells. High-dose vitamin C and E supplementation worsened hemolysis, causing increased reticulocytes, lactate dehydrogenase, indirect bilirubin, and haptoglobin.

Behavioral activation (BA) is an important precedent to improvements in self-management and ultimately health outcomes; however, few interventions targeting BA have been developed for the SCD population. The goal of the present study was to evaluate a technology-enhanced self-management intervention for adolescents and young adults (AYA) with SCD targeting BA domains (ie, disease knowledge, self-efficacy, motivation, and self-management skills). DESIGN/METHODS:Participants were randomized to one of two study arms. SCThrive participants (N = 26) completed six weekly group sessions, an in-person booster session, and used a companion app (iManage) to record symptoms, progress on goals, and connect with other group members. Each SCHealthEd participant (N = 27) received six weekly phone calls on SCD-related and general health education topics. All AYA completed questionnaires assessing BA at baseline and posttreatment. RESULTS:Separate mixed ANOVA analyses to assess for the effects of group (SCThrive/SCHealthEd), time (baseline/posttreatment), and group × time interaction indicated that there was a clinically meaningful improvement (8-point change) in self-efficacy, with a medium effect size, P = .09, η2  = .06, and there was statistically significant improvement in one self-management skill (tracking health), P = .001, d = .71, among SCThrive participants.

Transcranial Doppler (TCD) is useful at identifying increased risk of stroke in children with SCD and vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage. The main aim of this study was to determine the proportion of patients with SCD in the Gulf region who are at a high risk of stroke, as determined by TCD.Methods: This multicenter (Oman, Qatar, and UAE), descriptive, cross-sectional study in patients (aged 2-16 years) with SCD included a baseline visit, 1 follow-up visit for patients with conditional TCD, and 3-year retrospective data analysis for all patients.Results: Of the 410 eligible patients (Oman, 86.5%; Qatar, 8.2%; UAE, 5.1%), most had a TCD finding (left side, 91.7%; right side, 92.0%) of normal velocity (<155 cm/s) at baseline. For 6 of 7 patients with conditional velocity (155-179 cm/s) and 1 patient with high velocity (≥180 cm/s), baseline TCD results were not confirmed at follow-up. As per bivariate linear regression, age, race, transfusion type, and transfusion frequency were significant predictors of the TCD velocities. Multivariate logistic regressions revealed that TCD velocities were significantly correlated with sex, race, and type of transfusion. No patients reported any adverse events at follow-up. No deaths occurred during the study.Discussion/Conclusions: The study results show that far fewer patients with SCD in the Gulf have abnormal TCD findings than the internationally reported.

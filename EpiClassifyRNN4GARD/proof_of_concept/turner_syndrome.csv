32271829,"BACKGROUND:Turner syndrome (TS) is a chromosomal disorder, in which a female is partially or entirely missing one of the two X chromosomes, with a prevalence of 1:2500 live female births. The present study aims to identify a circulating microRNA (miRNA) signature for TS patients with and without congenital heart disease (CHD). METHODS:Microarray platform interrogating 2549 miRNAs were used to detect the miRNA abundance levels in the blood of 33 TS patients and 14 age-matched healthy volunteer controls (HVs). The differentially abundant miRNAs between the two groups were further validated by RT-qPCR. RESULTS:We identified 60 differentially abundant miRNA in the blood of TS patients compared to HVs, from which, 41 and 19 miRNAs showed a higher and a lower abundance levels in TS patients compared to HVs, respectively. RT-qPCR confirmed the significantly higher abundance levels of eight miRNAs namely miR-374b-5p, miR-199a-5p, miR-340-3p, miR-125b-5p, miR-30e-3p, miR-126-3p, miR-5695, and miR-26b-5p in TS patients as compared with the HVs. The abundance level of miR-5695 was higher in TS patients displaying CHD as compared to TS patients without CHD (p = 0.0265; log2-fold change 1.99); whereas, the abundance level of miR-126-3p was lower in TS patients with congenital aortic valve disease (AVD) compared to TS patients without BAV (p = 0.0139, log2-fold change 1.52). The clinical feature statistics revealed that miR-126-3p had a significant correlation with sinotubular junction Z-score (r = 0.42; p = 0.0154). CONCLUSION:The identified circulating miRNAs signature for TS patients with manifestations associated with cardiovascular diseases provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of TS that may guide the development of novel diagnostic approaches.",0.9896206855773926,True
32613319,"Turner syndrome (TS) is associated with coronary artery disease (CAD), an important cause of premature death in TS. However, the determinants of CAD in women with TS remain unknown. In a cross-sectional study design, 168 women without clinical evidence of CAD (115 with TS and 53 without TS) were assessed for the presence and volume of subclinical CAD using coronary CT angiography. Karyotype, the presence of congenital heart defects and conventional cardiovascular risk factors were also registered. Comparative analyses were performed (1) between women with and without TS and (2) in the TS group, between women with and without subclinical CAD. The prevalence of CAD, in crude and adjusted analyses, was not increased for women with TS (crude prevalence: 40 [35%] in TS vs. 25 [47%] in controls, p = 0.12). The volume of atherosclerosis was not higher in women with TS compared with controls (median and interquartile range 0 [0-92] in TS vs. 0 [0-81]mm3 in controls, p = 0.29). Among women with TS, women with subclinical CAD were older (46 ± 13 vs. 37 ± 11 years, p < 0.001), had higher blood pressure (systolic blood pressure 129 ± 16 vs. 121 ± 16 mmHg, p < 0.05) and were more frequently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes (5 [13%] vs. 2 [3%], p < 0.05). Karyotype or congenital heart defects were not associated with subclinical CAD. Some women with TS show early signs of CAD, however overall, not more than women without TS. Conventional cardiovascular risk factors were the principal determinants of CAD also in TS, and CAD prevention strategies should be observed.ClinicalTrial.gov Identifier: NCT01678261 ( https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01678261 ).",0.6829935312271118,True
32617534,"Background: The cognitive profile of Turner syndrome, a genetic disorder resulting from partial or complete X-chromosome deletion, presents characteristic deficits. Despite this, studies have yet to evaluate how deficits translate into and are compensated for in academic settings. This study seeks to explore cognitive functioning, as well as the accessibility and development of academic accommodations in females with Turner syndrome from adolescence to adulthood. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study took place at the National Institutes of Health. Females with Turner syndrome (age range: 10-68; n = 142) were evaluated on need for and procurement of academic accommodations. Cognitive functioning was evaluated in participants aged 20 years and older (n = 101), as per the age validation of the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, one-sample comparisons, and analyses of variance. Results: Females with Turner syndrome scored significantly lower than the normative population on visuospatial (p < 0.001), delayed memory (p < 0.001), and overall (p < 0.001) functioning. About 25.9% of participants reported that accommodations were not needed, despite displaying one or more cognitive deficits. Approximately 12.7% reported needing but not receiving accommodations, however, this is only reported by females 30 years and older; no females aged 10-29 years indicated this discrepancy. Conclusions: Findings suggest that procurement of academic accommodations has increased within recent decades. Still, there is a discrepancy between those displaying cognitive deficits and those receiving academic accommodations. We highlight frequently received accommodations so that students and professionals can target deficits with appropriate accommodations.",0.3949507176876068,False
32524771,"BACKGROUND:Turner syndrome (TS) occurs in approximately 1 in 2500 live female births and is caused by the partial or complete loss of one of the X chromosomes, resulting in abnormalities such as ovarian failure and infertility. However, pregnancy in women with TS may still occur via spontaneous pregnancy or through oocyte donation. Limited data exists on pregnancy in women with TS that could aid in clinical care. METHODS:We conducted a population-based cross-sectional study using data from the Discharge Abstract Database (2004-2015), which contains all labor and delivery hospitalizations across Canada (excluding Quebec) where women delivered a live or stillborn infant. The odds of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes for women with and without TS were calculated using backwards multivariable logistic regression with generalized estimating equations, adjusting for the Obstetric Comorbidity Index, mode of delivery, and year. RESULTS:Overall, 2,682,284 women delivered a live or stillborn infant during the study period and 44 birth events occurred for women with TS. No severe maternal morbidity or adverse cardiovascular events occurred for women with TS at their labor and delivery hospitalization. However, infants born to women with TS were 3.6 times more likely (95% CI: 1.7-7.8) to experience neonatal morbidity than those born to women without TS. These infants also were more likely to have had a preterm birth (aOR: 2.9, 95% CI: 1.6-5.4) and to be small-for-gestational-age (aOR: 4.5, 95% CI: 2.4-8.4). CONCLUSION:This study adds further understanding of the likelihood of adverse outcomes for pregnant women with TS.",0.16586396098136902,False
31216015,"Turner syndrome (TS) is a genetic disorder affecting approximately 1:2000 live-born females. It results from partial or complete X monosomy and is associated with a range of clinical issues including a unique cognitive profile and increased risk for certain behavioral problems. Structural neuroimaging studies in adolescents, adults, and older children with TS have revealed altered neuroanatomy but are unable to identify when in development differences arise. In addition, older children and adults have often been exposed to years of growth hormone and/or exogenous estrogen therapy with potential implications for neurodevelopment. The study presented here is the first to test whether brain structure is altered in infants with TS. Twenty-six infants with TS received high-resolution structural MRI scans of the brain at 1 year of age and were compared to 47 typically developing female and 39 typically developing male infants. Results indicate that the typical neuroanatomical profile seen in older individuals with TS, characterized by decreased gray matter volumes in premotor, somatosensory, and parietal-occipital cortex, is already present at 1 year of age, suggesting a stable phenotype with origins in the prenatal or early postnatal period.",0.059434693306684494,False
31854143,"Turner syndrome (TS) is a common multiple congenital anomaly syndrome resulting from complete or partial absence of the second X chromosome. In this study, we explore the phenotype of TS in diverse populations using clinical examination and facial analysis technology. Clinical data from 78 individuals and images from 108 individuals with TS from 19 different countries were analyzed. Individuals were grouped into categories of African descent (African), Asian, Latin American, Caucasian (European descent), and Middle Eastern. The most common phenotype features across all population groups were short stature (86%), cubitus valgus (76%), and low posterior hairline 70%. Two facial analysis technology experiments were conducted: TS versus general population and TS versus Noonan syndrome. Across all ethnicities, facial analysis was accurate in diagnosing TS from frontal facial images as measured by the area under the curve (AUC). An AUC of 0.903 (p < .001) was found for TS versus general population controls and 0.925 (p < .001) for TS versus individuals with Noonan syndrome. In summary, we present consistent clinical findings from global populations with TS and additionally demonstrate that facial analysis technology can accurately distinguish TS from the general population and Noonan syndrome.",0.043679483234882355,False
31706435,"Turner syndrome is one of the most common sex chromosomal anomalies, characterized by the complete or partial loss of one X chromosome. Females with Turner syndrome are characterized by skeletal abnormalities, short stature and primary ovarian insufficiency. The aim of this narrative review was to identify the underlying mechanisms of osteoporosis in Turner syndrome, summarize its clinical manifestations and provide suggestions regarding the management of osteoporosis. Girls and women with Turner syndrome have lower bone mineral density and a higher fracture rate than healthy individuals. The most important risk factors for osteoporosis are inadequately treated primary ovarian insufficiency, followed by intrinsic bone abnormalities. Comorbidities that further increase the risk of osteoporosis include vitamin D deficiency, celiac disease and inflammatory bowel disease. In addition, hearing problems can predispose to falls. Early initiation of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) at the age of 11-13 years, prompt titration to the adult dose after 2 years and long-term follow-up to ensure compliance with HRT are the cornerstones of osteoporosis prevention in women with Turner syndrome.",0.0428672693669796,False
31567543,"Turner syndrome is one of the most common chromosomal anomalies occurring in live-born females. It has been extensively reviewed in the medical literature, yet little has been discussed regarding the skeletal manifestations that present to the orthopaedic surgeon. It is important for the orthopaedic surgeon to be familiar with the clinical findings and comorbid conditions in Turner syndrome because they may be the first line of diagnosis when a patient presents for short stature, scoliosis, or slipped capital femoral epiphysis. Recent studies have identified the short stature homeobox gene as the main cause of the skeletal differences in patients with Turner syndrome, affecting longitudinal bone growth. Skeletal deformities including short stature, delayed skeletal maturation, angular deformity of the limbs, spinal deformity, and early-onset osteoporosis have been associated with Turner syndrome. This article will review the skeletal manifestations of Turner syndrome and propose guidelines for the treatment and monitoring of these patients.

32694884,"In Japan, anabolic steroid hormone (ASH) treatment for Turner syndrome (TS) to promote growth had been provided before GH therapy for TS was approved. ASH effectively improved the adult height (AH) of TS patients without spontaneous puberty but decreased the AH of TS patients with spontaneous puberty. Although GH therapy for TS was approved in 1991, the approved dosage remained 0.5 IU/kg/wk for GH-deficient TS patients and improved AH by approximately 7 cm. However, AH did not reach -2 standard deviations in healthy girls. In 1999, the requirement of GH deficiency was removed and a dose of 1.0 IU/kg/wk was approved. Although an increase in AH was expected, no reports showed significant improvements in AH at a high dose of GH. GH + ASH combination therapy was reevaluated and recommended for TS patients with gonadal failure and an extremely short stature or those who respond poorly to GH therapy. Although early estrogen replacement therapy is recommended to improve psychological quality of life and prevent osteoporosis, it lowered AH even at a low dose of ethinyl estradiol (25 ng/kg/d). The initiation of ethynyl estradiol at an extremely low dose (1-5 ng/kg/d) at a relatively young age successfully improved AH.",0.02754170447587967,False
32131408,"Girls with Turner syndrome (TS) are at increased risk of developing insulin resistance and coronary artery disease as a result of hypertension and obesity frequently seen in these patients. On the other hand, it is known that obesity is associated with increased serum levels of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs: valine; leucine and isoleucine) and aromatic amino acids. The aim of the study is to compare the metabolic fingerprint of girls with TS to the metabolic fingerprint of girls with obesity. Metabolic fingerprinting using an untargeted metabolomic approach was examined in plasma from 46 girls with TS (study group) and 22 age-matched girls with obesity (control group). The mean values of BCAAs, methionine, phenylalanine, lysine, tryptophan, histidine, tyrosine, alanine and ornithine were significantly lower in the study group than in the control (p from 0.0025 to <0.000001). Strong significant correlation between BCAAs, phenylalanine, arginine, tyrosine, glutamic acid, citrulline and alanine, and body mass index expressed as standard deviation score BMI-SDS in the patients with obesity (p from 0.049 to 0.0005) was found. In contrast; there was no correlation between these amino acids and BMI-SDS in the girls with TS. It is suggested that obesity in patients with TS is not associated with altered amino acids metabolism.",0.027394741773605347,False
32478293,"OBJECTIVE:The early diagnosis of Turner syndrome (TS) is often difficult because of the various clinical features. This study aimed to investigate clinical features and identify associated abnormalities in a group of patients with TS. METHODS:Retrospective data of presenting clinical features collected from the medical records of the 37 patients with TS. All patients were examined for associated clinical abnormalities. RESULTS:Mean age at diagnosis was 9.3±4.1 years. The main reason for referral was short stature and/or delayed puberty. All of the patients had at least one dysmorphic sign. Skeletal system abnormalities (57%) were the most common associated abnormality, which was followed by gastrointestinal system problems (40%). Cardiac defects occurred in 32%. Urinary system abnormalities occurred in 27%. Dermatological problems were detected in 32% of the patients. The pathology of the hearing was found in 19%. Autoimmune thyroid disease was detected in 24% of the patients, and celiac disease was detected in 5.4% of the patients.

32623843,"BACKGROUND:Turner syndrome (TS) is a chromosomal disorder with short stature as the most common feature. The aim of this paper is to show the characteristics of TS patients treated at our Clinic, with an emphasis on their age at diagnosis and the effect of growth hormone therapy on their final height and height gain. METHODS:This retrospective study is based on the medical records of 37 female pediatric patients aged 0-18 years treated at the Pediatric Department of the Sestre milosrdnice University Hospital Center from 1997 to 2017. RESULTS:Mean age at diagnosis is 7.55 ±5.13 years. In the observed period a trend towards later diagnosis was shown (p=0.004). Most patients (26) were treated with rhGH. The average height of all patients who reached their final height (n=30) was 151.49 ±6.49 cm (SDS -1.73 ±1.11). The initial height SDS was significantly lower in the treated compared to the untreated patients (p=0.02). The final height was 151.59 ±7.21 cm (SDS -1.72 ±1.3) in the treated and 151.12 ±5.85 cm (SDS -1.77 ±0.94) in the untreated patients. The difference between the initial and final height was significantly greater in the treated patients compared to the untreated patients (30.46 and 16.28 cm, p=0.039). The same was true for the difference between the initial and final height SDS (0.78, or -0.3, p=0.042). CONCLUSIONS:Based on the results of this research, TS is increasingly diagnosed at a later age.

32669396,"OBJECTIVES:Women with Turner syndrome (TS) are frequently counselled against pregnancy due to lack of data and unclear aortic dissection risk. However, with advances in fertility therapy, more women with TS are contemplating pregnancy. This study compared rates of adverse cardiovascular (CV) outcomes among: (1) pregnant and non-pregnant women with TS and (2) pregnant women with TS with/without structural heart disease. METHODS:Retrospective analysis of pregnant and age-matched non-pregnant controls with TS (2005-2017) across 10 CV centres was done. Data were collected at initial evaluation in pregnancy and outcomes were assessed to 6 months postpartum. Adverse CV events were defined as CV death, aortic dissection/rupture and/or aortic intervention. Non-pregnant age-matched controls were followed over the same time period. RESULTS:Sixty-eight pregnancies were included (60 women, mean age 33 years, 48% primigravid, 49% fertility therapy, 80% structurally normal heart, 25% XO karyotype). Based on American Society of Reproductive Medicine criteria, 10 pregnancies occurred in women stratified to high-risk category. There were no CV events in the pregnant women or in the non-pregnant women with TS. Obstetric events complicated 12 (18%) pregnancies with 9 (13%) attributed to hypertensive disorder of pregnancy. Fetal events included small for gestational age neonates (18%), preterm delivery (15%) and fetal death (3%). CONCLUSIONS:This study helps to refine the approach to pregnancy in women with TS. Among women with TS without structural heart disease, pregnancy does not impose an increased risk of CV outcomes. Among women with TS with structural heart disease, the risk of pregnancy is not as prohibitive as previously described but does require ongoing evaluation.",0.016129624098539352,False
32622407,"OBJECTIVE:To study fertility issues and pregnancy outcomes in Turner syndrome (TS). DESIGN:Retrospective cohort study. SETTING:Not applicable.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S):Fertility choices, spontaneous pregnancy, and oocyte donation (OD) outcomes. Conditions associated with aortic dissection and poor pregnancy outcomes at preconception were considered. Pregnancy-related aortic dimension changes and the long-term impact of pregnancy on TS-related comorbidities were assessed. RESULTS(S):In all, 13.5% had spontaneous pregnancies, resulting in a pregnancy with live birth in 18 patients (37 newborns); 16% considered OD, one adopted, and one underwent fertility preservation. Spontaneous pregnancy predictive factors were a karyotype with a second or third cell line with more than one X and spontaneous menarche. In all, 47.6% had miscarriages, two experienced preeclampsia, and two had gestational diabetes. One daughter was diagnosed with TS in adulthood. Seven of 14 who attempted OD had a pregnancy with live birth; two of seven had gestational diabetes; 64.3% attempting OD had risk factors associated with poor pregnancy outcomes, including four who had double embryo transfer. Cardiac status at preconception was evaluated in 12 of 25 women who had a pregnancy. The aortic diameters during pregnancy increased. The aortic growth at sinuses was 0.51 ± 0.71 mm/year and at ascending aorta 0.67 ± 0.67 mm/year, reaching a significant difference at sinuses compared with the growth in nulliparous TS. Among women who had a pregnancy, none experienced aortic dissection during and in the years after pregnancy.

Therefore, this study aimed to clarify the current situation of pregnancy and delivery in women with TS in Japan. METHODS:Our study comprised primary and secondary surveys and we included perinatal centers approved by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare. RESULTS:A total of 24 cases from 19 facilities were reported, and we obtained individual information for 20 cases from 16 facilities. Of these 20 patients, 13 (65%) had become pregnant via oocyte donation. Three of these patients had received oocyte donation in Japan, while the other 10 had received donations in foreign countries. The other seven patients became pregnant with their own oocyte, with spontaneous menarche. Live babies were delivered by 18 patients, while an induced abortion was required at 18 weeks of gestation in one patient and an intrauterine fetal death from an unknown cause was detected at 38 weeks of gestation in another patient. Cesarean section was performed in 14 patients, with the most frequent indication being cephalopelvic disproportion. The rate of implementation of screening for complications related to TS was low, suggesting insufficient cooperation between facilities responsible for TS treatment, infertility and pregnancy and delivery management.

32118693,"OBJECTIVE:To examine the early cognitive, temperament, and adaptive functioning of infants and toddlers with Turner syndrome (TS). METHODS:Cognitive abilities were measured using the Mullen Scales of Early Learning at 1 year of age for 31 girls with TS and compared with neurotypical female (N = 53) and male (N = 54) control groups. Temperament (Carey Toddler Temperament Scales) and adaptive functioning (Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales-Second Edition) were measured at 1 year of age and compared with normative data. An exploratory analysis of cognitive/developmental trajectories was also conducted comparing age 12-month to 24-month time points for 22 TS subjects. RESULTS:Infants with TS performed largely within the average range for adaptive behavior, temperament, and early cognitive development with some increased risk for delays in language and significant increased risk for delays in motor skills (p < 0.001). Although exploratory, there was some suggestion of slower rates of progression in fine-motor and visual reception skills from 12 to 24 months of age. CONCLUSIONS:Infants and toddlers with TS exhibit a relatively positive neurodevelopmental profile overall, with some indication of an increasing gap in function in fine-motor and visual perceptual abilities as compared to neurotypical peers. It is unclear whether these apparent differences represent normal variability in this very young population or, perhaps, are early precursors of later phenotypic characteristics of TS in the school-age and young adult years.",0.012618698179721832,False

Scientific literature suggests an association between hearing loss and Turner syndrome, but it remains a controversial topic. OBJECTIVE:To associate the cytogenetic alteration with the audiometric profile of individuals with Turner syndrome. METHODS:Cross-sectional study, with a hospital-based, convenience sample. Patients diagnosed with Turner syndrome were included and those with difficulty understanding the audiometry and/or other associated syndromes were excluded. The participants were studied with pure tone audiometry. RESULTS:Of the 65 patients included, 36.9% had X chromosome monosomy and 63.0% had other alterations. Regarding the audiometry, 64.6% had normal thresholds and 35.3% had hearing impairment. Of these, 30.4% had hybrid hearing loss, 26.0% alteration at 6 and/or 8kHz, 17.3% had conductive hearing loss, 13.0% sensorineural loss and 13.0% had mixed hearing loss. We observed that the mild degree was the most frequent one. There was no statistically significant association between the cytogenetic type of Turner syndrome and the presence or absence of hearing loss, or with the type and degree of hearing loss.

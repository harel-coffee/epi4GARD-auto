## Binary Classification of Rare Disease Abstracts using Transformers (Epidemiology)
The purpose of this folder is to create a transformer model that can classify rare disease abstracts from PubMed as epidemiological or not.

The [Final Model](https://huggingface.co/ncats/EpiClassify4GARD) and the [Final Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ncats/GARD_EpiSet4TextClassification) are published on the [NCATS Hugging Face page](https://huggingface.co/ncats). 

It utilizes the dataset and some methods described in [John et al, Recurrent Neural Networks to Automatically Identify Rare Disease Epidemiologic Studies from PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34457147/).

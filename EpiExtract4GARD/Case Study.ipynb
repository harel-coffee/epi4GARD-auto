The aim of this study was to assess the risks of psychiatric disorders in a large cohort of 905 individuals with NF1 and 7614 population comparisons matched on sex and year of birth. The cohort was linked to the Danish Psychiatric Central Research Register to ascertain information on hospital contacts for psychiatric disorders based on the International Classification of Diseases version 8 and 10. The hazard ratio (HR) for a first psychiatric hospital contact was higher in girls (4.19, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.81-9.69) and boys with NF1 (5.02, 95% CI 3.27-7.69) &lt;7 years of age than in the population comparisons. Both sexes had increased HRs for developmental disorders, including attention deficit/hyperactivity disorders, autism spectrum disorders, and intellectual disabilities in childhood. Females with NF1 had also increased HRs for unipolar depression, other emotional and behavioral disorders, and severe stress reaction and adjustment disorders in early adulthood. The HRs for psychoses, schizophrenia, bipolar disorders, and substance abuse were similar in individuals with NF1 and the population comparisons. Finally, the cumulative incidence of a first hospital contact due to any psychiatric disorder by age 30 years was 35% (95% CI 29-41) in females and 28% (95% CI 19-37) in males with NF1. Thus, screening for psychiatric disorders may be important for early diagnosis and facilitation of appropriate and effective treatment in individuals with NF1.</td>\n",

However, there are limited population-based data on the epidemiology of this disease. Using a large database, we sought to describe the epidemiology and risk association of NETs of the appendix.&lt;h4&gt;Method&lt;/h4&gt;We queried a multi-institutional database (Explorys Inc., Cleveland, OH, USA), comprising 360 hospitals in the United States (US), for patients with a diagnosis of NETs of the appendix from 2014-2019.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Of the 30,324,050 individuals in the database, 2020 patients had an appendiceal NET diagnosis (0.007%). The most common presenting symptoms included abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Patients with appendiceal NETs were more likely to be female (odds ratio [OR] 1.36, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.24-1.49), Caucasian (OR 2.71, 95%CI 2.40-3.07), with a history of smoking (OR 1.82, 95%CI 1.65-2.01), family history of primary gastrointestinal malignancy (OR 7.26, 95%CI 6.31-8.33), diagnosis of multiple endocrine tumor type 1 (OR 52.31, 95%CI 23.15-118.23), or neurofibromatosis type 1 (OR 16.37, 95%CI 7.24-37.01).&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;In a population-based study in the US, using the Explorys database, we found the overall prevalence of NETs of the appendix to be 7 per 100,000 persons.

Using logistic regression models, we assessed the associations between these 2 neurocutaneous syndromes and birth characteristics in a cohort that included 1804 subjects with NF1 and 450 with tuberous sclerosis.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Children with NF1 and tuberous sclerosis were significantly more likely to be born preterm and via cesarean delivery. In addition, children with NF1 were also more likely to be born with other birth characteristics, such as short length, a large head circumference, and a low Apgar score. Moreover, children with NF1 had an increased odds of being born with a high birth weight or large for gestational age (OR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.42-1.82 and OR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.60-2.06, respectively).&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;Children with NF1 and tuberous sclerosis differ from the general population in terms of several birth characteristics, with the strongest associations observed for high birth weight and large for gestational age in individuals with NF1.</td>\n",

Penetrance is virtually 100%, but the expression is highly variable and almost every organ can be affected. Diagnosis of NF1 is made with at least two of the following diagnostic criteria: six or more cafè-au-lait spots, two neurofibromas or one plexiform neurofibroma, axillary or groin freckling, optic glioma, two Lisch nodules, bone dysplasia and first-degree relative with NF1. Other ocular manifestations include orbital neurofibromas, cafè-au-lait spots on the eyelids, congenital dysplasia of the sphenoids wing and con-genital glaucoma and choroidal abnormalities. Congenital Ectropion Uveae (CEU) is a rare, non-progressive anomaly characterized by the presence of iris pigment epithelium on the anterior surface of the iris stroma, resulting from its proliferation. CEU probably depends on embryological disorders in neural cells and/or neuroectoderm of the optic cell. In this paper the authors describe three patients with CEU and NF1 found in 243 consecutive NF1 patients.</td>\n",

Dementia-related hospital visits were retrieved from the Finnish Care Register for Health Care using International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) diagnosis codes G30 and F00-F03. Purchases of antidementia drugs were queried with Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification code N06D from the drug reimbursement register maintained by the Social Insurance Institution of Finland. The follow-up spanned 1998-2014.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Totals of 16 and 165 individuals with at least two dementia-related diagnoses or drug purchases were identified in the NF1 and control cohorts, respectively. The hazard ratio for dementia in NF1 was 1.67 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00-2.80, P = 0.050).

Here we report a case of neurofibromatosis type 1 with subarachnoid hemorrhage due to multiple and de novo aneurysms.&lt;h4&gt;Case presentation&lt;/h4&gt;The patient was a 49-year-old Japanese woman with a history of neurofibromatosis type 1. She was transported to our hospital owing to disturbance of consciousness and was diagnosed with subarachnoid hemorrhage by computed tomography. Computed tomography angiography revealed multiple, small intracranial aneurysms, and we suspected that one of them in the peripheral branch of the left middle cerebral artery was the source of hemorrhage based on the distribution of hematoma. The patient underwent emergency surgery. Because it was difficult to identify an aneurysm in the most peripheral part of the left middle cerebral artery in the initial surgery, only one aneurysm was clipped. Later, a peripheral aneurysm was clipped using the navigation system. Because both aneurysms were small intracranial aneurysms (&lt; 2 mm), either of them could be the source of hemorrhage. The postoperative course was good, and the patient was discharged in healthy condition. Because brain magnetic resonance imaging performed in the previous year did not find aneurysms at the same site, she was diagnosed with rupture of a de novo aneurysm. Neurofibromatosis type 1 might have caused the rupture of multiple intracranial aneurysms in a short period in this patient.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;Neurofibromatosis type 1 may be complicated by the formation of multiple intracranial aneurysms in a short period.</td>\n",

Incidence of postoperative motor and sensory deficits is unknown, and reconstruction aimed at restoring such deficits is infrequently carried out.&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;To identify the incidence and risk factors of postoperative morbidity in MPNST as well as the use and outcomes of functional reconstructions in these patients.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;Postoperative function and treatment of MPNSTs diagnosed from 1988 to 2019 in 10 cancer centers was obtained. Two models were constructed evaluating factors independently associated with postoperative motor (&lt;M3) or critical sensory loss. Critical sensation was defined as partial or complete loss of hand, foot, or buttocks sensation.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;A total of 756 patients (33.4% neurofibromatosis type 1, NF1) were included. MPNSTs originated in 34.4% from a major nerve. Of 658 surgically treated patients, 27.2% had &lt;M3 muscle power and 24.3% critical sensory loss. Amputations were carried out in 61 patients. Independent risk factors for motor and sensory loss included patients with NF1, symptomatic, deep-seated, extremity, or plexus tumors originating from major nerves (all P &lt; .05). A total of 26 patients underwent functional reconstructions. The majority (64%) of these patients regained at least M3 muscle power and 33% M4 despite 86% receiving multimodal therapy.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;Resection of MPNSTs commonly results in motor and sensory deficits. Patients with NF1, symptomatic, deep-seated tumors, arising from major nerves were associated with a higher risk for developing postoperative morbidity.

The aim of this study was to assess the risks of psychiatric disorders in a large cohort of 905 individuals with NF1 and 7614 population comparisons matched on sex and year of birth. The cohort was linked to the Danish Psychiatric Central Research Register to ascertain information on hospital contacts for psychiatric disorders based on the International Classification of Diseases version 8 and 10. The hazard ratio (HR) for a first psychiatric hospital contact was higher in girls (4.19, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.81-9.69) and boys with NF1 (5.02, 95% CI 3.27-7.69) <7 years of age than in the population comparisons. Both sexes had increased HRs for developmental disorders, including attention deficit/hyperactivity disorders, autism spectrum disorders, and intellectual disabilities in childhood. Females with NF1 had also increased HRs for unipolar depression, other emotional and behavioral disorders, and severe stress reaction and adjustment disorders in early adulthood. The HRs for psychoses, schizophrenia, bipolar disorders, and substance abuse were similar in individuals with NF1 and the population comparisons. Finally, the cumulative incidence of a first hospital contact due to any psychiatric disorder by age 30 years was 35% (95% CI 29-41) in females and 28% (95% CI 19-37) in males with NF1. Thus, screening for psychiatric disorders may be important for early diagnosis and facilitation of appropriate and effective treatment in individuals with NF1.   \n",

However, there are limited population-based data on the epidemiology of this disease. Using a large database, we sought to describe the epidemiology and risk association of NETs of the appendix.<h4>Method</h4>We queried a multi-institutional database (Explorys Inc., Cleveland, OH, USA), comprising 360 hospitals in the United States (US), for patients with a diagnosis of NETs of the appendix from 2014-2019.<h4>Results</h4>Of the 30,324,050 individuals in the database, 2020 patients had an appendiceal NET diagnosis (0.007%). The most common presenting symptoms included abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Patients with appendiceal NETs were more likely to be female (odds ratio [OR] 1.36, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.24-1.49), Caucasian (OR 2.71, 95%CI 2.40-3.07), with a history of smoking (OR 1.82, 95%CI 1.65-2.01), family history of primary gastrointestinal malignancy (OR 7.26, 95%CI 6.31-8.33), diagnosis of multiple endocrine tumor type 1 (OR 52.31, 95%CI 23.15-118.23), or neurofibromatosis type 1 (OR 16.37, 95%CI 7.24-37.01).<h4>Conclusions</h4>In a population-based study in the US, using the Explorys database, we found the overall prevalence of NETs of the appendix to be 7 per 100,000 persons. The incidence in the year January 2019-January 2020 was 0.4 per 100,000 individuals. These rates are higher than previously reported and may be more accurate, given the more comprehensive nature of the Explorys database.   \n",

Individuals with NF1 and individuals with tuberous sclerosis were identified using data from Swedish population-based health data registers. Using logistic regression models, we assessed the associations between these 2 neurocutaneous syndromes and birth characteristics in a cohort that included 1804 subjects with NF1 and 450 with tuberous sclerosis.<h4>Results</h4>Children with NF1 and tuberous sclerosis were significantly more likely to be born preterm and via cesarean delivery. In addition, children with NF1 were also more likely to be born with other birth characteristics, such as short length, a large head circumference, and a low Apgar score. Moreover, children with NF1 had an increased odds of being born with a high birth weight or large for gestational age (OR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.42-1.82 and OR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.60-2.06, respectively).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Children with NF1 and tuberous sclerosis differ from the general population in terms of several birth characteristics, with the strongest associations observed for high birth weight and large for gestational age in individuals with NF1.   \n",

Penetrance is virtually 100%, but the expression is highly variable and almost every organ can be affected. Diagnosis of NF1 is made with at least two of the following diagnostic criteria: six or more cafè-au-lait spots, two neurofibromas or one plexiform neurofibroma, axillary or groin freckling, optic glioma, two Lisch nodules, bone dysplasia and first-degree relative with NF1. Other ocular manifestations include orbital neurofibromas, cafè-au-lait spots on the eyelids, congenital dysplasia of the sphenoids wing and con-genital glaucoma and choroidal abnormalities. Congenital Ectropion Uveae (CEU) is a rare, non-progressive anomaly characterized by the presence of iris pigment epithelium on the anterior surface of the iris stroma, resulting from its proliferation. CEU probably depends on embryological disorders in neural cells and/or neuroectoderm of the optic cell. In this paper the authors describe three patients with CEU and NF1 found in 243 consecutive NF1 patients.   \n",

Dementia-related hospital visits were retrieved from the Finnish Care Register for Health Care using International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) diagnosis codes G30 and F00-F03. Purchases of antidementia drugs were queried with Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification code N06D from the drug reimbursement register maintained by the Social Insurance Institution of Finland. The follow-up spanned 1998-2014.<h4>Results</h4>Totals of 16 and 165 individuals with at least two dementia-related diagnoses or drug purchases were identified in the NF1 and control cohorts, respectively. The hazard ratio for dementia in NF1 was 1.67 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00-2.80, P = 0.050). In an analysis stratified by the type of dementia, the risk for Alzheimer disease was increased in NF1 compared to controls with a hazard ratio of 2.88 (95% CI 1.47-5.66, P = 0.002).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Dementia and especially Alzheimer disease are previously unrecognized neurological complications of NF1.   \n",

Here we report a case of neurofibromatosis type 1 with subarachnoid hemorrhage due to multiple and de novo aneurysms.<h4>Case presentation</h4>The patient was a 49-year-old Japanese woman with a history of neurofibromatosis type 1. She was transported to our hospital owing to disturbance of consciousness and was diagnosed with subarachnoid hemorrhage by computed tomography. Computed tomography angiography revealed multiple, small intracranial aneurysms, and we suspected that one of them in the peripheral branch of the left middle cerebral artery was the source of hemorrhage based on the distribution of hematoma. The patient underwent emergency surgery. Because it was difficult to identify an aneurysm in the most peripheral part of the left middle cerebral artery in the initial surgery, only one aneurysm was clipped. Later, a peripheral aneurysm was clipped using the navigation system. Because both aneurysms were small intracranial aneurysms (< 2 mm), either of them could be the source of hemorrhage. The postoperative course was good, and the patient was discharged in healthy condition. Because brain magnetic resonance imaging performed in the previous year did not find aneurysms at the same site, she was diagnosed with rupture of a de novo aneurysm. Neurofibromatosis type 1 might have caused the rupture of multiple intracranial aneurysms in a short period in this patient.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Neurofibromatosis type 1 may be complicated by the formation of multiple intracranial aneurysms in a short period.   \n",
       "1  Morbidity and Function Loss After Resection of Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumors. <h4>Background</h4>Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are aggressive soft tissue sarcomas. Their resection may lead to serious morbidity. Incidence of postoperative motor and sensory deficits is unknown, and reconstruction aimed at restoring such deficits is infrequently carried out.<h4>Objective</h4>To identify the incidence and risk factors of postoperative morbidity in MPNST as well as the use and outcomes of functional reconstructions in these patients.<h4>Methods</h4>Postoperative function and treatment of MPNSTs diagnosed from 1988 to 2019 in 10 cancer centers was obtained. Two models were constructed evaluating factors independently associated with postoperative motor (<M3) or critical sensory loss. Critical sensation was defined as partial or complete loss of hand, foot, or buttocks sensation.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 756 patients (33.4% neurofibromatosis type 1, NF1) were included. MPNSTs originated in 34.4% from a major nerve. Of 658 surgically treated patients, 27.2% had <M3 muscle power and 24.3% critical sensory loss. Amputations were carried out in 61 patients. Independent risk factors for motor and sensory loss included patients with NF1, symptomatic, deep-seated, extremity, or plexus tumors originating from major nerves (all P < .05). A total of 26 patients underwent functional reconstructions. The majority (64%) of these patients regained at least M3 muscle power and 33% M4 despite 86% receiving multimodal therapy.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Resection of MPNSTs commonly results in motor and sensory deficits. Patients with NF1, symptomatic, deep-seated tumors, arising from major nerves were associated with a higher risk for developing postoperative morbidity. Functional reconstructions are infrequently performed but can improve functional outcomes.   \n",

The aim of this study was to analyze the 10-year secular trends in the incidence of microtia and/or anotia in Taiwan from 2008 to 2017 using nationwide population-based data.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;Patient data were retrieved from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Dataset, after identifying 1152 children aged ≤ 1 year with a first-time diagnosis of microtia or anotia between January 2008 and December 2017. The annual microtia-anotia incidence rate was the sum of new microtia-anotia cases in a year divided by total infant population in the year. Furthermore, we used the annual percent change (APC) to study the secular trend in microtia-anotia incidence rate.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;The annual incidence rate of microtia-anotia averaged across the 10-year period was 57.7 per 100,000 infants (standard deviation = 8.6). The annual incidence rates of microtia and anotia were 53.3 and 4.4 per 100,000 infants, respectively, during this period. Furthermore, female infants had a higher incidence than males (63.3 vs. 52.4 per 100,000). The incidence of microtia-anotia gradually decreased between 2008 and 2017 with an APC of - 5.64% (95% CI - 9.31 ~ - 1.18%, p = 0.004). Since 2011, females had a significantly higher annual incidence rate of microtia-anotia than males.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;The incidence of microtia-anotia was 57.7 per 100,000 infants in Taiwan, which declined during the study period 2008-2017.

Ninety-two birth defects surveillance programs were evaluated with a total of 8917 cases of microtia-anotia. We computed the prevalence per 10,000 births for each surveillance program for total cases of microtia-anotia (microtia types I to IV), microtia (types I to III), and anotia (type IV). Prevalence ratios were calculated by large geographic areas, race/ethnicity, and by surveillance methodologies.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;The overall prevalences were: microtia-anotia, 2.06 (confidence interval [CI], 2.02-2.10); microtia, 1.55 (CI, 1.50-1.60); and anotia 0.36 (CI, 0.34-0.38). Higher prevalences were observed for the Americas, Northern Europe and Asia, among Hispanics and Asians, and among active ascertainment and hospital-based surveillance programs.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;We observed marked variation in the prevalence of microtia-anotia across surveillance programs and within countries. These results must be interpreted cautiously as this variability may be explained mainly by differences in surveillance methods. However, given the magnitude of some of the differences, other factors may also be involved. This study contributes to the knowledge of the prevalence of microtia-anotia by providing a critical analysis of the existing data. In addition, it supports the need for a coding system that allows complete phenotype characterization of microtia-anotia, including severity and laterality, as well as for further studies on the variation of its frequency related to race and ethnicity.</td>\n",

Hemifacial microsomia (HFM) is the second most common congenital disability of the face, with a prevalence of 1 in 3000 to 5600 live births. Although etiology is still not fully understood, including both genetics and environmental factors, the latest reports indicate the prominence of premature loss of the neural crest cells. What is more, a deficit of muscles of mastication, except the masseter, correlates in the pathomechanism of mandibular underdevelopment. Due to the significant phenotypic diversification, the typical picture of HFM cannot be determined. It may present as an esthetic concern-minor asymmetry with deformed auricle, and on the contrary, as microtia/anotia with conductive type hearing loss, hypoplastic mandible, and microphthalmia, impairing patient's daily activities. Referring to psychosocial problems, it has been proved that in population with HFM, there is a modestly elevated risk for behavior problems, social competence, and less acceptance. Over the years, more comprehensive methods of assessing the extent and severity of the HFM as the OMENS (+) classification have emerged. The authors like to summarize and present for plastic surgery resident and plastic surgeons the critical features of HFM, including the epidemiology, clinical presentation, pathogenesis, and innovative management reported in the current literature.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Microtia: A Data Linkage Study of Epidemiology and Implications for Service Delivery. &lt;b&gt;Introduction:&lt;/b&gt; Previous studies of microtia epidemiology globally have demonstrated significant geographical and ethnic variation, cited broadly as affecting 3-5 in 10,000 live births. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of microtia in a largely homogeneous ethnic population in the United Kingdom (Wales) and to identify factors, such as distance and socioeconomic status, which may influence the access to surgical intervention. &lt;b&gt;Materials and Methods:&lt;/b&gt; A retrospective cohort study was conducted using data linkage to identify patients born between 2000 and 2018 with a diagnosis of microtia. Microtia incidence was calculated using annual and geographic birth rates. Surgical operation codes were used to classify patients into those that had no surgery, autologous reconstruction or prosthetic reconstruction. Sociodemographic attributes were compared using descriptive statistics to determine differences in access to each type of surgical intervention. &lt;b&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt; A total of 101 patients were identified, 64.4% were male and the median age was 12 (8-16). The mean annual incidence was 2.13 microtia cases per 10,000 births over the 19-year study period. Both temporal and geographic variation was noted. The majority of patients undergoing surgery opted for autologous reconstruction (72.9%) at a median age of 9 (7-10) compared to 7 (5-8) for prosthetic reconstruction. Autologous reconstruction had a higher median number of surgeries (2, 1-3) than prosthetic (1.5, 1-2) and a higher median socioeconomic status of 3 (2-4) compared to 2 (1-4) for the prosthetic cohort. There were no statistically significant differences in the distance traveled for surgery. &lt;b&gt;Discussion:&lt;/b&gt; This study highlights a role for data linkage in epidemiological analyses and provides a revised incidence of microtia in Wales. Although the majority of patients opted for autologous reconstruction, demographic disparities in socioeconomic status warrant further investigation, emphasizing the importance of striving for equity in accessibility to surgical intervention.</td>\n",

The purpose of this investigation was to assess the prevalence and the types of these associated anomalies in a defined population. The associated anomalies in infants with AM were collected in all livebirths, stillbirths and terminations of pregnancy during 29 years in 387,067 consecutive births in the area covered by our population-based registry of congenital malformations. Of the 146 cases with AM registered during this period, representing a prevalence of 3.77 per 10,000, 49.3% had associated anomalies. There were 14 (9.6%) cases with chromosomal abnormalities including 5 trisomies 18, and 18 (12.3%) nonchromosomal recognized dysmorphic conditions including 6 cases with oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum. However, numerous other recognized dysmorphic conditions were registered. Forty (27.4%) of the cases had multiple congenital anomalies (MCA). Anomalies especially in the cardiovascular, the musculoskeletal, the urogenital, the central nervous, and the digestive systems, and facial clefts were the most common other anomalies. This study included special strengths: each affected child was examined by a geneticist, all elective terminations were ascertained, and the surveillance for anomalies was continued until 2 years of age. In conclusion the overall prevalence of associated anomalies, which was one in every two cases, emphasizes the need for a thorough investigation of cases with AM. A routine screening for other anomalies may be considered in infants and in fetuses with AM.</td>\n",

Background:Earlier studies have suggested that microtia is a genetic disease with a worldwide incidence of microtia is between 0.83/10,000 and 17.40/10,000. For microtia, auricle morphology is the most crucial characteristic. However, no studies have been performed to characterize the genetic similarity of microtia and auricle morphology similarity. For the sporadic patients, the relationship between the gestational age of parents and the incidence of microtia is unclear. To obtain the characteristics of auricular deformity multiple case family (AD-MCF) and clarify the relationship between genetic similarity and auricle morphology similarity in AD-MCF. Methods:This study included 463 AD patients who were diagnosed by Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, from 2013 to 2019. Among these patients, 116 are from 43 MCF and the other 347 patients are sporadic. For the patients from families, the disease status of the four generations of immediate family members and the family tree map were collected to analyze the similarity of auricle shape in family members. A score evaluated the similarity of auricle shape according to the structure of the residual ear and the similarity in the morphology of each auricle. Moreover, the population distribution of AD and the gestational age of patients were further analyzed. Results:From 2013 to 2019, a total of 463 patients were diagnosed as microtia in our hospital. There were 427 patients with unilateral disease and 36 patients with bilateral disease. Among them, 116 patients were from 34 families and 9 de novo families. The total scores of patients in different genetic difference levels were compared and were found significantly different (P&lt;0.001). Moreover, 58.14% of families were consistent with the law of chromosomal recessive genetic diseases. Importantly, we found that the gestational age of father in microtia de novo families is 30.94±0.75, and mother in de novo is 28.39±0.73 that is significantly higher than the gestational ages of parents from microtia families with P value =0.0001. Conclusions:The auricle similarity between family members is positively related to the genetic distance between family members. The microtia patients are potentially associated with the gestational ages of parents.</td>\n",

The χ2 test was performed to analyse the interaction between isolated microtia and CHD.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;With the colour Doppler echocardiographic examination's data from 804 consecutive isolated microtia patients, we found CHD, including atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, tetralogy of Fallot, patent ductus arteriosus, and others, occurred in 52 of 804 patients (6.5%). Atrial septal defect prevalence in patients with isolated microtia was significantly higher than ventricular septal defect (24/804 versus 11/804, p &lt; 0.05) and patent ductus arteriosus (24/804 versus 2/804, p &lt; 0.001). Ventricular septal defect prevalence in patients with isolated microtia was significantly higher than patent ductus arteriosus (11/804 versus 2/804, p &lt; 0.05). All four types of microtia (concha-type microtia, small concha-type microtia, lobule-type microtia, and anotia) had similar incidences of CHD with no difference in the incidences among these types (p &gt; 0.05 respectively). Furthermore, there was no significant difference in the incidence of the atrial septal defect among the four subtypes (p &gt; 0.05 respectively). Similarly, ventricular septal defect and patent ductus arteriosus also showed no differences (p &gt; 0.05 respectively).&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;The overall incidences of CHD and three most common CHD subtypes (atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, and patent ductus arteriosus) in patients with isolated microtia are higher than general population. The prevalence of CHD among patients with isolated microtia does not increase with the severity of microtia. According to our experience in this study, we suggest colour Doppler echocardiographic imaging should be performed for isolated microtia patients soon after birth if possible. Furthermore, for the plastic surgeon and anaesthesiologist, it is important to take pre-operative colour Doppler echocardiographic images which can help evaluate heart function to ensure the safety of the peri-operative period. Future studies when investigating CHDs associated with isolated microtia could focus on genetic and molecular mechanisms.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Birth prevalence of congenital anomalies in Argentina, according to socioeconomic level. Birth prevalence of congenital anomalies (CA) in Argentina is estimated around 1.7%. CA are the second leading cause of infant mortality. Poverty and other adverse socioeconomic conditions have been associated with birth defects. To describe the prevalence at birth of CA, according to the two proxy variables of socioeconomic level: the health subsector of the hospital where the cases were born (PUB-public versus PRI-private or social security) and its geographical location. The design of the study was ecological using the data of the National Network of Congenital Anomalies of Argentina (RENAC); from October 2010 to December 2018. CA birth prevalence was estimated using the Poisson regression. We used a logistic regression model to analyze the association birth prevalence to health subsector and geographical region. A total of 2,202,994 births were examined in the study period, with a global CA prevalence of 1.69% (95% CI 1.68-1.71). The highest prevalence was observed in PUB hospitals when comparing to PRI hospitals at the country level and in all regions. There were differences in the prevalence of selected congenital anomalies with a statistically significant association to PUB (observed in anencephaly, encephalocele, hydrocephalus, microcephaly, holoprosencephaly, microtia/anotia, cleft lip and palate, postaxial polydactyly, talipes equinovarus, talipes calcaneovalgus, and gastroschisis). The prevalence of critical heart defects and chromosomal anomalies was significantly higher in PRI hospitals. Although this is an ecological study with no information on socioeconomic status at individual level, we found an association between CA frequency and selected CA with the PUB subsector. Vulnerable populations affected with CA require a greater effort from policy makers and health care providers to allocate more resources and design strategies to access to health.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Isolated Microtia With Anterior Hemispheric Polymicrogyria. We report on a male infant who presented with neonatal clonic seizure and was found to have isolated left-sided microtia on clinical examination. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed extensive polymicrogyria over the bilateral perisylvian and frontal cortex. He had no other associated anomaly on physical examination, genetics, metabolic, and radio imaging studies. The study of the data collected from the Italian Birth Defect Registry reported the incidence of microtia-anotia as 1.46/10 000. Microtia-anotia can also be found in association with other anomalies that characterizes oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum. Although oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum has been associated with various cerebral malformations, isolated microtia usually does not have such association.

We examined the association between selected Hispanic ethnicity and acculturation factors and anotia/microtia in the National Birth Defects Prevention Study.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;We examined data from mothers of 351 infants with isolated anotia/microtia and 8435 unaffected infants from the National Birth Defects Prevention Study with an expected delivery date from 1997 to 2007. Sociodemographic, maternal, and acculturation factors (e.g., age, maternal education, household income, body mass index, gestational diabetes, folic acid, smoking, alcohol intake, study center, parental birthplace, and years lived in the United States, maternal language) were assessed as overall risk factors and also as risk factors among subgroups of Hispanics (United States- and foreign-born) versus non-Hispanic whites.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Compared with non-Hispanic whites, both United States- and foreign-born Hispanic mothers demonstrated substantially higher odds of delivering infants with anotia/microtia across nearly all strata of sociodemographic and other maternal factors (adjusted odds ratios range: 2.1-11.9). The odds of anotia/microtia was particularly elevated among Hispanic mothers who emigrated from Mexico after age five (adjusted odds ratios = 4.88; 95% confidence interval = 2.93-8.11) or who conducted the interview in Spanish (adjusted odds ratios = 4.97; 95% confidence interval = 3.00-8.24).&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;We observed that certain sociodemographic and acculturation factors are associated with higher risks of anotia/microtia among offspring of Hispanic mothers.</td>\n",

The aim of this study was to analyze the 10-year secular trends in the incidence of microtia and/or anotia in Taiwan from 2008 to 2017 using nationwide population-based data.<h4>Methods</h4>Patient data were retrieved from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Dataset, after identifying 1152 children aged ≤ 1 year with a first-time diagnosis of microtia or anotia between January 2008 and December 2017. The annual microtia-anotia incidence rate was the sum of new microtia-anotia cases in a year divided by total infant population in the year. Furthermore, we used the annual percent change (APC) to study the secular trend in microtia-anotia incidence rate.<h4>Results</h4>The annual incidence rate of microtia-anotia averaged across the 10-year period was 57.7 per 100,000 infants (standard deviation = 8.6). The annual incidence rates of microtia and anotia were 53.3 and 4.4 per 100,000 infants, respectively, during this period. Furthermore, female infants had a higher incidence than males (63.3 vs. 52.4 per 100,000). The incidence of microtia-anotia gradually decreased between 2008 and 2017 with an APC of - 5.64% (95% CI - 9.31 ~ - 1.18%, p = 0.004). Since 2011, females had a significantly higher annual incidence rate of microtia-anotia than males.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The incidence of microtia-anotia was 57.7 per 100,000 infants in Taiwan, which declined during the study period 2008-2017. The female-to-male incidence ratio was 1.21:1.   \n",

Ninety-two birth defects surveillance programs were evaluated with a total of 8917 cases of microtia-anotia. We computed the prevalence per 10,000 births for each surveillance program for total cases of microtia-anotia (microtia types I to IV), microtia (types I to III), and anotia (type IV). Prevalence ratios were calculated by large geographic areas, race/ethnicity, and by surveillance methodologies.<h4>Results</h4>The overall prevalences were: microtia-anotia, 2.06 (confidence interval [CI], 2.02-2.10); microtia, 1.55 (CI, 1.50-1.60); and anotia 0.36 (CI, 0.34-0.38). Higher prevalences were observed for the Americas, Northern Europe and Asia, among Hispanics and Asians, and among active ascertainment and hospital-based surveillance programs.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We observed marked variation in the prevalence of microtia-anotia across surveillance programs and within countries. These results must be interpreted cautiously as this variability may be explained mainly by differences in surveillance methods. However, given the magnitude of some of the differences, other factors may also be involved. This study contributes to the knowledge of the prevalence of microtia-anotia by providing a critical analysis of the existing data. In addition, it supports the need for a coding system that allows complete phenotype characterization of microtia-anotia, including severity and laterality, as well as for further studies on the variation of its frequency related to race and ethnicity.   \n",

Hemifacial microsomia (HFM) is the second most common congenital disability of the face, with a prevalence of 1 in 3000 to 5600 live births. Although etiology is still not fully understood, including both genetics and environmental factors, the latest reports indicate the prominence of premature loss of the neural crest cells. What is more, a deficit of muscles of mastication, except the masseter, correlates in the pathomechanism of mandibular underdevelopment. Due to the significant phenotypic diversification, the typical picture of HFM cannot be determined. It may present as an esthetic concern-minor asymmetry with deformed auricle, and on the contrary, as microtia/anotia with conductive type hearing loss, hypoplastic mandible, and microphthalmia, impairing patient's daily activities. Referring to psychosocial problems, it has been proved that in population with HFM, there is a modestly elevated risk for behavior problems, social competence, and less acceptance. Over the years, more comprehensive methods of assessing the extent and severity of the HFM as the OMENS (+) classification have emerged. The authors like to summarize and present for plastic surgery resident and plastic surgeons the critical features of HFM, including the epidemiology, clinical presentation, pathogenesis, and innovative management reported in the current literature.   \n",

The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of microtia in a largely homogeneous ethnic population in the United Kingdom (Wales) and to identify factors, such as distance and socioeconomic status, which may influence the access to surgical intervention. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> A retrospective cohort study was conducted using data linkage to identify patients born between 2000 and 2018 with a diagnosis of microtia. Microtia incidence was calculated using annual and geographic birth rates. Surgical operation codes were used to classify patients into those that had no surgery, autologous reconstruction or prosthetic reconstruction. Sociodemographic attributes were compared using descriptive statistics to determine differences in access to each type of surgical intervention. <b>Results:</b> A total of 101 patients were identified, 64.4% were male and the median age was 12 (8-16). The mean annual incidence was 2.13 microtia cases per 10,000 births over the 19-year study period. Both temporal and geographic variation was noted. The majority of patients undergoing surgery opted for autologous reconstruction (72.9%) at a median age of 9 (7-10) compared to 7 (5-8) for prosthetic reconstruction. Autologous reconstruction had a higher median number of surgeries (2, 1-3) than prosthetic (1.5, 1-2) and a higher median socioeconomic status of 3 (2-4) compared to 2 (1-4) for the prosthetic cohort. There were no statistically significant differences in the distance traveled for surgery. <b>Discussion:</b> This study highlights a role for data linkage in epidemiological analyses and provides a revised incidence of microtia in Wales. Although the majority of patients opted for autologous reconstruction, demographic disparities in socioeconomic status warrant further investigation, emphasizing the importance of striving for equity in accessibility to surgical intervention.   \n",

Infants with anotia and microtia (AM) often have other non-AM associated congenital anomalies. The purpose of this investigation was to assess the prevalence and the types of these associated anomalies in a defined population. The associated anomalies in infants with AM were collected in all livebirths, stillbirths and terminations of pregnancy during 29 years in 387,067 consecutive births in the area covered by our population-based registry of congenital malformations. Of the 146 cases with AM registered during this period, representing a prevalence of 3.77 per 10,000, 49.3% had associated anomalies. There were 14 (9.6%) cases with chromosomal abnormalities including 5 trisomies 18, and 18 (12.3%) nonchromosomal recognized dysmorphic conditions including 6 cases with oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum. However, numerous other recognized dysmorphic conditions were registered. Forty (27.4%) of the cases had multiple congenital anomalies (MCA). Anomalies especially in the cardiovascular, the musculoskeletal, the urogenital, the central nervous, and the digestive systems, and facial clefts were the most common other anomalies. This study included special strengths: each affected child was examined by a geneticist, all elective terminations were ascertained, and the surveillance for anomalies was continued until 2 years of age. In conclusion the overall prevalence of associated anomalies, which was one in every two cases, emphasizes the need for a thorough investigation of cases with AM. A routine screening for other anomalies may be considered in infants and in fetuses with AM.   \n",

The authors' study aimed to investigate the relationships between age, sex, type of microtia, and birth place and associated malformation as seen in 1 private Japanese clinic.<h4>Methods</h4>Cases of anotia/microtia that presented in Nagata Microtia and Reconstructive Plastic Surgery Clinic (Saitama, Japan) between 2005 and 2018 were included in the study. The authors identified 1896 patients with anotia/microtia with or without associated malformation. Most were primary cases, with some secondary reconstruction cases wherein the primary surgery was performed at another hospital. Cases were classified with Nagata classification; lobule type, small concha type, concha type, and anotia. Cryptotia was also observed in this study.<h4>Results</h4>Among the patients, 61.1% were male, 85.4% had unilateral defects (69.0% LB), and 59.1% had a right-sided defect. Most patients were less than 1 year old (15.0%) or 8 to 10 years old (5.5%-6.3%) on first examination, while 58% were from the Kanto region, including Tokyo. Regarding concomitant disorders, 32.7% had an accompanying malformation, while 13.3% had associated syndromes (eg, craniofacial microsomia, Treacher Collins syndrome). To conclude, in the authors' clinic, most cases of anotia/microtia were LB, unilateral, and seen in male patients. Information regarding several characteristic clinical features was obtained, especially that clefts and musculoskeletal deformities of the skull/face and jaw were the main accompanying malformations.   \n",

Recently, an increasing trend of the birth prevalence of anotia/microtia is observed in China, contributed by changes of social environment and lifestyle. There seems to be no major breakthroughs in exact pathogenesis of microtia, though the research results related to molecular genetics unceasingly appear. In this review, the authors focus on the results of various research methods which the authors regard as the preferential suspicious gene pool to facilitate the exploration of the pathogenic genes of microtia, knowing that the mechanism of microtia is very complicated. The advantages and limitations of these various approaches will also be systematically delineated. The authors believe that this review will give a deep insight in the genetic research of microtia and help plastic surgeons manage congenital microtia more effectively.   \n",

Background:Earlier studies have suggested that microtia is a genetic disease with a worldwide incidence of microtia is between 0.83/10,000 and 17.40/10,000. For microtia, auricle morphology is the most crucial characteristic. However, no studies have been performed to characterize the genetic similarity of microtia and auricle morphology similarity. For the sporadic patients, the relationship between the gestational age of parents and the incidence of microtia is unclear. To obtain the characteristics of auricular deformity multiple case family (AD-MCF) and clarify the relationship between genetic similarity and auricle morphology similarity in AD-MCF. Methods:This study included 463 AD patients who were diagnosed by Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, from 2013 to 2019. Among these patients, 116 are from 43 MCF and the other 347 patients are sporadic. For the patients from families, the disease status of the four generations of immediate family members and the family tree map were collected to analyze the similarity of auricle shape in family members. A score evaluated the similarity of auricle shape according to the structure of the residual ear and the similarity in the morphology of each auricle. Moreover, the population distribution of AD and the gestational age of patients were further analyzed. Results:From 2013 to 2019, a total of 463 patients were diagnosed as microtia in our hospital. There were 427 patients with unilateral disease and 36 patients with bilateral disease. Among them, 116 patients were from 34 families and 9 de novo families. The total scores of patients in different genetic difference levels were compared and were found significantly different (P<0.001). Moreover, 58.14% of families were consistent with the law of chromosomal recessive genetic diseases. Importantly, we found that the gestational age of father in microtia de novo families is 30.94±0.75, and mother in de novo is 28.39±0.73 that is significantly higher than the gestational ages of parents from microtia families with P value =0.0001. Conclusions:The auricle similarity between family members is positively related to the genetic distance between family members. The microtia patients are potentially associated with the gestational ages of parents.   \n",
       "11  Congenital heart defects in patients with isolated microtia: evaluation using colour Doppler echocardiographic image. <h4>Background</h4>The objective of this study was to delineate the characteristics and incidence of congenital heart disease (CHD) in patients with isolated microtia and to determine whether the prevalence of CHD among patients with isolated microtia increases with the severity of microtia.<h4>Methods</h4>A total of 804 consecutive patients had a pre-operative colour Doppler echocardiographic examination. A retrospective study was performed with the clinical and imaging data from November, 2017 to January, 2019. The χ2 test was performed to analyse the interaction between isolated microtia and CHD.<h4>Results</h4>With the colour Doppler echocardiographic examination's data from 804 consecutive isolated microtia patients, we found CHD, including atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, tetralogy of Fallot, patent ductus arteriosus, and others, occurred in 52 of 804 patients (6.5%). Atrial septal defect prevalence in patients with isolated microtia was significantly higher than ventricular septal defect (24/804 versus 11/804, p < 0.05) and patent ductus arteriosus (24/804 versus 2/804, p < 0.001). Ventricular septal defect prevalence in patients with isolated microtia was significantly higher than patent ductus arteriosus (11/804 versus 2/804, p < 0.05). All four types of microtia (concha-type microtia, small concha-type microtia, lobule-type microtia, and anotia) had similar incidences of CHD with no difference in the incidences among these types (p > 0.05 respectively). Furthermore, there was no significant difference in the incidence of the atrial septal defect among the four subtypes (p > 0.05 respectively). Similarly, ventricular septal defect and patent ductus arteriosus also showed no differences (p > 0.05 respectively).<h4>Conclusions</h4>The overall incidences of CHD and three most common CHD subtypes (atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, and patent ductus arteriosus) in patients with isolated microtia are higher than general population. The prevalence of CHD among patients with isolated microtia does not increase with the severity of microtia. According to our experience in this study, we suggest colour Doppler echocardiographic imaging should be performed for isolated microtia patients soon after birth if possible. Furthermore, for the plastic surgeon and anaesthesiologist, it is important to take pre-operative colour Doppler echocardiographic images which can help evaluate heart function to ensure the safety of the peri-operative period. Future studies when investigating CHDs associated with isolated microtia could focus on genetic and molecular mechanisms.   \n",

Birth prevalence of congenital anomalies (CA) in Argentina is estimated around 1.7%. CA are the second leading cause of infant mortality. Poverty and other adverse socioeconomic conditions have been associated with birth defects. To describe the prevalence at birth of CA, according to the two proxy variables of socioeconomic level: the health subsector of the hospital where the cases were born (PUB-public versus PRI-private or social security) and its geographical location. The design of the study was ecological using the data of the National Network of Congenital Anomalies of Argentina (RENAC); from October 2010 to December 2018. CA birth prevalence was estimated using the Poisson regression. We used a logistic regression model to analyze the association birth prevalence to health subsector and geographical region. A total of 2,202,994 births were examined in the study period, with a global CA prevalence of 1.69% (95% CI 1.68-1.71). The highest prevalence was observed in PUB hospitals when comparing to PRI hospitals at the country level and in all regions. There were differences in the prevalence of selected congenital anomalies with a statistically significant association to PUB (observed in anencephaly, encephalocele, hydrocephalus, microcephaly, holoprosencephaly, microtia/anotia, cleft lip and palate, postaxial polydactyly, talipes equinovarus, talipes calcaneovalgus, and gastroschisis). The prevalence of critical heart defects and chromosomal anomalies was significantly higher in PRI hospitals. Although this is an ecological study with no information on socioeconomic status at individual level, we found an association between CA frequency and selected CA with the PUB subsector. Vulnerable populations affected with CA require a greater effort from policy makers and health care providers to allocate more resources and design strategies to access to health.   \n",

We report on a male infant who presented with neonatal clonic seizure and was found to have isolated left-sided microtia on clinical examination. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed extensive polymicrogyria over the bilateral perisylvian and frontal cortex. He had no other associated anomaly on physical examination, genetics, metabolic, and radio imaging studies. The study of the data collected from the Italian Birth Defect Registry reported the incidence of microtia-anotia as 1.46/10 000. Microtia-anotia can also be found in association with other anomalies that characterizes oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum. Although oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum has been associated with various cerebral malformations, isolated microtia usually does not have such association. We could not find any report of polymicrogyria in a case of isolated microtia.   \n",

We examined the association between selected Hispanic ethnicity and acculturation factors and anotia/microtia in the National Birth Defects Prevention Study.<h4>Methods</h4>We examined data from mothers of 351 infants with isolated anotia/microtia and 8435 unaffected infants from the National Birth Defects Prevention Study with an expected delivery date from 1997 to 2007. Sociodemographic, maternal, and acculturation factors (e.g., age, maternal education, household income, body mass index, gestational diabetes, folic acid, smoking, alcohol intake, study center, parental birthplace, and years lived in the United States, maternal language) were assessed as overall risk factors and also as risk factors among subgroups of Hispanics (United States- and foreign-born) versus non-Hispanic whites.<h4>Results</h4>Compared with non-Hispanic whites, both United States- and foreign-born Hispanic mothers demonstrated substantially higher odds of delivering infants with anotia/microtia across nearly all strata of sociodemographic and other maternal factors (adjusted odds ratios range: 2.1-11.9). The odds of anotia/microtia was particularly elevated among Hispanic mothers who emigrated from Mexico after age five (adjusted odds ratios = 4.88; 95% confidence interval = 2.93-8.11) or who conducted the interview in Spanish (adjusted odds ratios = 4.97; 95% confidence interval = 3.00-8.24).<h4>Conclusion</h4>We observed that certain sociodemographic and acculturation factors are associated with higher risks of anotia/microtia among offspring of Hispanic mothers.   \n",

       "      <td>The GRACILE syndrome, a neonatal lethal metabolic disorder with iron overload. GRACILE syndrome (Fellman syndrome, MIM 603358), an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder of the Finnish disease heritage, has been diagnosed in 25 infants of 18 families. The incidence is at least 1/47,000 in Finland. The main findings are fetal growth retardation, Fanconi type aminoaciduria, cholestasis, iron overload (liver hemosiderosis, hyperferritinemia, hypotransferrinemia, increased transferrin iron saturation, and free plasma iron), profound lactic acidosis, and early death. The pathophysiology of the metabolic disturbance is unsolved. No significant deficiency of complex III activity of respiratory chain has been found, although we recently showed that the underlying genetic cause is a missense mutation (S78G) in the BCS1L gene and other mutations in that gene have been associated with complex III deficiency. BCS1L encodes a mitochondrial protein, acting as a chaperone in the assembly of complex III. Iron accumulation in liver, a typical feature being less abundant with increasing age, might be a primary abnormality or a secondary phenomenon due to liver dysfunction. In order to decrease the iron overload, three infants have been repeatedly treated with apotransferrin followed by exchange transfusion. Improvement in iron biochemistry occurred, but no clear beneficial effect on the clinical condition was found. Further studies will elucidate the role of iron in the pathophysiology of the disease.</td>\n",

       "0  The GRACILE syndrome, a neonatal lethal metabolic disorder with iron overload. GRACILE syndrome (Fellman syndrome, MIM 603358), an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder of the Finnish disease heritage, has been diagnosed in 25 infants of 18 families. The incidence is at least 1/47,000 in Finland. The main findings are fetal growth retardation, Fanconi type aminoaciduria, cholestasis, iron overload (liver hemosiderosis, hyperferritinemia, hypotransferrinemia, increased transferrin iron saturation, and free plasma iron), profound lactic acidosis, and early death. The pathophysiology of the metabolic disturbance is unsolved. No significant deficiency of complex III activity of respiratory chain has been found, although we recently showed that the underlying genetic cause is a missense mutation (S78G) in the BCS1L gene and other mutations in that gene have been associated with complex III deficiency. BCS1L encodes a mitochondrial protein, acting as a chaperone in the assembly of complex III. Iron accumulation in liver, a typical feature being less abundant with increasing age, might be a primary abnormality or a secondary phenomenon due to liver dysfunction. In order to decrease the iron overload, three infants have been repeatedly treated with apotransferrin followed by exchange transfusion. Improvement in iron biochemistry occurred, but no clear beneficial effect on the clinical condition was found. Further studies will elucidate the role of iron in the pathophysiology of the disease.   \n",

       "      <td>Metabolic syndrome in Portugal: prevalence and implications for cardiovascular risk--results from the VALSIM Study. &lt;h4&gt;Introduction&lt;/h4&gt;The metabolic syndrome (MS) is a constellation of risk factors of metabolic origin that is associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Several regional studies have been conducted to determine its prevalence, but they are insufficient to determine the situation nationally or to characterize overall cardiovascular risk in Portugal.&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;To determine the prevalence of MS and each of its components in adult primary health care users in Portugal.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;The VALSIM Study, involving 719 general practitioners (GPs), was performed in a primary care setting, based on stratified distribution and proportional to the population density of each region of mainland Portugal and the islands of Madeira and the Azores. The first two adult patients scheduled for an appointment on a given day were invited to participate, irrespective of the reason for the consultation. After informed consent was obtained, a questionnaire on sociodemographic, clinical and laboratory data was completed by the GP. A previous diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD), stroke or DM was identified by the GP based on medical records. A diagnosis of MS was defined according to the NCEP ATP III criteria. Logistic regression multivariate analysis was used to assess the risk of MS according to age, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC) and region of residence for each gender, and to determine the association of CAD, stroke and DM with gender, age, BMI, WC, blood pressure and previous diagnosis of hypertension (HT), fasting glucose and previous diagnosis of DM.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;The study included 16,856 individuals (mean age 58.1+/-15.1 years, 18-96 years; 61.62% women). The prevalence of MS adjusted for gender, age and size of region was 27.5% and showed regional variations, being highest in the Alentejo (30.99%) and lowest in the Algarve (24.42%). MS was more common among women and increased with age, BMI and WC. Independent protective factors were residence in the Algarve (odds ratio [OR]: 0.78; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.66-0.92 p=0.002) or in Lisbon and Tagus Valley (OR: 0.83, 95% CI 0.77-0.91, p&lt;0.001), while residence in the Northern (OR: 1.11; 95% CI 1.01-1.21, p=0.03) or Central regions (OR: 1.08; 95% CI 1.002-1.16, p=0.045) was an independent risk factor after correction for gender and age. MS was linked to increased prevalence of HT (OR: 3.88; 95% CI 3.61-4.18, p&lt;0.001), and high blood pressure was the most frequent MS component, particularly in men (93.7%). MS was the most powerful factor associated with a diagnosis of DM, particularly in women (OR 7.23; 95% CI 6.22-8.40, p&lt;0.001). Although there was a strong association between MS and CAD (OR: 1.16; 95% CI 1.01-1.34, p=0.043), the most potent risk factor associated with CVD was HT.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;The prevalence of MS in Portugal is high (27.5%) and is strongly linked to the occurrence of CVD, and in particular to DM. These results highlight the need to implement preventive strategies for reducing overall cardiovascular risk in the Portuguese population.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Genetic Basis of Human Congenital Heart Disease. Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common major congenital anomaly with an incidence of ∼1% of live births and is a significant cause of birth defect-related mortality. The genetic mechanisms underlying the development of CHD are complex and remain incompletely understood. Known genetic causes include all classes of genetic variation including chromosomal aneuploidies, copy number variants, and rare and common single-nucleotide variants, which can be either de novo or inherited. Among patients with CHD, ∼8%-12% have a chromosomal abnormality or aneuploidy, between 3% and 25% have a copy number variation, and 3%-5% have a single-gene defect in an established CHD gene with higher likelihood of identifying a genetic cause in patients with nonisolated CHD. These genetic variants disrupt or alter genes that play an important role in normal cardiac development and in some cases have pleiotropic effects on other organs. This work reviews some of the most common genetic causes of CHD as well as what is currently known about the underlying mechanisms.</td>\n",

       "      <td>A Population-Specific Major Allele Reference Genome From The United Arab Emirates Population. The ethnic composition of the population of a country contributes to the uniqueness of each national DNA sequencing project and, ideally, individual reference genomes are required to reduce the confounding nature of ethnic bias. This work represents a representative Whole Genome Sequencing effort of an understudied population. Specifically, high coverage consensus sequences from 120 whole genomes and 33 whole exomes were used to construct the first ever population specific major allele reference genome for the United Arab Emirates (UAE). When this was applied and compared to the archetype hg19 reference, assembly of local Emirati genomes was reduced by ∼19% (i.e., some 1 million fewer calls). In compiling the United Arab Emirates Reference Genome (UAERG), sets of annotated 23,038,090 short (novel: 1,790,171) and 137,713 structural (novel: 8,462) variants; their allele frequencies (AFs) and distribution across the genome were identified. Population-specific genetic characteristics including loss-of-function variants, admixture, and ancestral haplogroup distribution were identified and reported here. We also detect a strong correlation between &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt; &lt;sub&gt;ST&lt;/sub&gt; and admixture components in the UAE. This baseline study was conceived to establish a high-quality reference genome and a genetic variations resource to enable the development of regional population specific initiatives and thus inform the application of population studies and precision medicine in the UAE.</td>\n",

Despite the low overall prevalence of individual rare diseases, cochlear dysfunction leading to hearing loss represents a symptom in a large proportion. The aim of this work was to provide a clear overview of rare cochlear diseases, taking into account the embryonic development of the cochlea and the systematic presentation of the different disorders. Although rapid biotechnological and bioinformatic advances may facilitate the diagnosis of a rare disease, an interdisciplinary exchange is often required to raise the suspicion of a rare disease. It is important to recognize that the phenotype of rare inner ear diseases can vary greatly not only in non-syndromic but also in syndromic hearing disorders. Finally, it becomes clear that the phenotype of the individual rare diseases cannot be determined exclusively by classical genetics even in monogenetic disorders.</td>\n",

Hirschsprung disease (HSCR, aganglionic megacolon) is the main genetic cause of functional intestinal obstruction with an incidence of 1/5000 live births. This developmental disorder is a neurocristopathy and is characterised by the absence of the enteric ganglia along a variable length of the intestine. In the last decades, the development of surgical approaches has dramatically decreased mortality and morbidity, which has allowed the emergence of familial cases. HSCR appeared to be a multifactorial malformation with low, sex dependent penetrance and variable expression according to the length of the aganglionic segment, suggesting the involvement of one or more gene(s) with low penetrance. So far, eight genes have been found to be involved in HSCR. This frequent congenital malformation now stands as a model for genetic disorders with complex patterns of inheritance.</td>\n",

       "      <td>A genetic study of Hirschsprung disease. Hirschsprung disease, or congenital aganglionic megacolon, is commonly assumed to be a sex-modified multifactorial trait. To test this hypothesis, complex segregation analysis was performed on data on 487 probands and their families. Demographic information on probands and the recurrence risk to relatives of probands are presented. An increased sex ratio (3.9 male:female) and an elevated risk to sibs (4%), as compared with the population incidence (0.02%), are observed, with the sex ratio decreasing and the recurrence risk to sibs increasing as the aganglionosis becomes more extensive. Down syndrome was found at an increased frequency among affected individuals but not among their unaffected sibs, and the increase was not associated with maternal age. Complex segregation analysis was performed on these family data. The families were classified into separate categories by extent of aganglionosis. For cases with aganglionosis beyond the sigmoid colon, the mode of inheritance is compatible with a dominant gene with incomplete penetrance, while for cases with aganglionosis extending no farther than the sigmoid colon, the inheritance pattern is equally likely to be either multifactorial or due to a recessive gene with very low penetrance. A model of gene action with random effects during morphogenesis is compatible with our observations.</td>\n",

       "4  Metabolic syndrome in Portugal: prevalence and implications for cardiovascular risk--results from the VALSIM Study. <h4>Introduction</h4>The metabolic syndrome (MS) is a constellation of risk factors of metabolic origin that is associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Several regional studies have been conducted to determine its prevalence, but they are insufficient to determine the situation nationally or to characterize overall cardiovascular risk in Portugal.<h4>Objective</h4>To determine the prevalence of MS and each of its components in adult primary health care users in Portugal.<h4>Methods</h4>The VALSIM Study, involving 719 general practitioners (GPs), was performed in a primary care setting, based on stratified distribution and proportional to the population density of each region of mainland Portugal and the islands of Madeira and the Azores. The first two adult patients scheduled for an appointment on a given day were invited to participate, irrespective of the reason for the consultation. After informed consent was obtained, a questionnaire on sociodemographic, clinical and laboratory data was completed by the GP. A previous diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD), stroke or DM was identified by the GP based on medical records. A diagnosis of MS was defined according to the NCEP ATP III criteria. Logistic regression multivariate analysis was used to assess the risk of MS according to age, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC) and region of residence for each gender, and to determine the association of CAD, stroke and DM with gender, age, BMI, WC, blood pressure and previous diagnosis of hypertension (HT), fasting glucose and previous diagnosis of DM.<h4>Results</h4>The study included 16,856 individuals (mean age 58.1+/-15.1 years, 18-96 years; 61.62% women). The prevalence of MS adjusted for gender, age and size of region was 27.5% and showed regional variations, being highest in the Alentejo (30.99%) and lowest in the Algarve (24.42%). MS was more common among women and increased with age, BMI and WC. Independent protective factors were residence in the Algarve (odds ratio [OR]: 0.78; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.66-0.92 p=0.002) or in Lisbon and Tagus Valley (OR: 0.83, 95% CI 0.77-0.91, p<0.001), while residence in the Northern (OR: 1.11; 95% CI 1.01-1.21, p=0.03) or Central regions (OR: 1.08; 95% CI 1.002-1.16, p=0.045) was an independent risk factor after correction for gender and age. MS was linked to increased prevalence of HT (OR: 3.88; 95% CI 3.61-4.18, p<0.001), and high blood pressure was the most frequent MS component, particularly in men (93.7%). MS was the most powerful factor associated with a diagnosis of DM, particularly in women (OR 7.23; 95% CI 6.22-8.40, p<0.001). Although there was a strong association between MS and CAD (OR: 1.16; 95% CI 1.01-1.34, p=0.043), the most potent risk factor associated with CVD was HT.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The prevalence of MS in Portugal is high (27.5%) and is strongly linked to the occurrence of CVD, and in particular to DM. These results highlight the need to implement preventive strategies for reducing overall cardiovascular risk in the Portuguese population.   \n",

Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common major congenital anomaly with an incidence of ∼1% of live births and is a significant cause of birth defect-related mortality. The genetic mechanisms underlying the development of CHD are complex and remain incompletely understood. Known genetic causes include all classes of genetic variation including chromosomal aneuploidies, copy number variants, and rare and common single-nucleotide variants, which can be either de novo or inherited. Among patients with CHD, ∼8%-12% have a chromosomal abnormality or aneuploidy, between 3% and 25% have a copy number variation, and 3%-5% have a single-gene defect in an established CHD gene with higher likelihood of identifying a genetic cause in patients with nonisolated CHD. These genetic variants disrupt or alter genes that play an important role in normal cardiac development and in some cases have pleiotropic effects on other organs. This work reviews some of the most common genetic causes of CHD as well as what is currently known about the underlying mechanisms.   \n",

The ethnic composition of the population of a country contributes to the uniqueness of each national DNA sequencing project and, ideally, individual reference genomes are required to reduce the confounding nature of ethnic bias. This work represents a representative Whole Genome Sequencing effort of an understudied population. Specifically, high coverage consensus sequences from 120 whole genomes and 33 whole exomes were used to construct the first ever population specific major allele reference genome for the United Arab Emirates (UAE). When this was applied and compared to the archetype hg19 reference, assembly of local Emirati genomes was reduced by ∼19% (i.e., some 1 million fewer calls). In compiling the United Arab Emirates Reference Genome (UAERG), sets of annotated 23,038,090 short (novel: 1,790,171) and 137,713 structural (novel: 8,462) variants; their allele frequencies (AFs) and distribution across the genome were identified. Population-specific genetic characteristics including loss-of-function variants, admixture, and ancestral haplogroup distribution were identified and reported here. We also detect a strong correlation between <i>F</i> <sub>ST</sub> and admixture components in the UAE. This baseline study was conceived to establish a high-quality reference genome and a genetic variations resource to enable the development of regional population specific initiatives and thus inform the application of population studies and precision medicine in the UAE.   \n",

Despite the low overall prevalence of individual rare diseases, cochlear dysfunction leading to hearing loss represents a symptom in a large proportion. The aim of this work was to provide a clear overview of rare cochlear diseases, taking into account the embryonic development of the cochlea and the systematic presentation of the different disorders. Although rapid biotechnological and bioinformatic advances may facilitate the diagnosis of a rare disease, an interdisciplinary exchange is often required to raise the suspicion of a rare disease. It is important to recognize that the phenotype of rare inner ear diseases can vary greatly not only in non-syndromic but also in syndromic hearing disorders. Finally, it becomes clear that the phenotype of the individual rare diseases cannot be determined exclusively by classical genetics even in monogenetic disorders.   \n",

Hirschsprung disease (HSCR, aganglionic megacolon) is the main genetic cause of functional intestinal obstruction with an incidence of 1/5000 live births. This developmental disorder is a neurocristopathy and is characterised by the absence of the enteric ganglia along a variable length of the intestine. In the last decades, the development of surgical approaches has dramatically decreased mortality and morbidity, which has allowed the emergence of familial cases. HSCR appeared to be a multifactorial malformation with low, sex dependent penetrance and variable expression according to the length of the aganglionic segment, suggesting the involvement of one or more gene(s) with low penetrance. So far, eight genes have been found to be involved in HSCR. This frequent congenital malformation now stands as a model for genetic disorders with complex patterns of inheritance.   \n",

Hirschsprung disease, or congenital aganglionic megacolon, is commonly assumed to be a sex-modified multifactorial trait. To test this hypothesis, complex segregation analysis was performed on data on 487 probands and their families. Demographic information on probands and the recurrence risk to relatives of probands are presented. An increased sex ratio (3.9 male:female) and an elevated risk to sibs (4%), as compared with the population incidence (0.02%), are observed, with the sex ratio decreasing and the recurrence risk to sibs increasing as the aganglionosis becomes more extensive. Down syndrome was found at an increased frequency among affected individuals but not among their unaffected sibs, and the increase was not associated with maternal age. Complex segregation analysis was performed on these family data. The families were classified into separate categories by extent of aganglionosis. For cases with aganglionosis beyond the sigmoid colon, the mode of inheritance is compatible with a dominant gene with incomplete penetrance, while for cases with aganglionosis extending no farther than the sigmoid colon, the inheritance pattern is equally likely to be either multifactorial or due to a recessive gene with very low penetrance. A model of gene action with random effects during morphogenesis is compatible with our observations.   \n",

Thus, we designed this study to estimate the TAK prevalence and incidence in residential Shanghai, China.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;Data on diagnosed TAK cases aged over 16 years were retrieved from 22 tertiary hospitals in Shanghai through hospital electronic medical record systems between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2017 to estimate the prevalence and incidence. A systematic literature review based on searches in PubMed, Ovid-Medline, Excerpta Medica Database (EMBASE), Web of Science, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) was performed to summarize TAK distribution across the world.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;In total 102 TAK patients, with 64% female, were identified. The point prevalence (2015-2017) was 7.01 (95% CI 5.65-8.37) cases per million, and the mean annual incidence was 2.33 (1.97-3.21) cases per million. The average age of TAK patients was 44 ± 16 years, with the highest prevalence (11.59 [9.23-19.50] cases per million) and incidence (3.55 [0.72 3.74] cases per million) in the 16 to 34 years population. Seventeen reports were included in the system review, showing that the epidemiology of TAK varied greatly across the world. The incidence and prevalence were both relatively higher in Asian countries, with the prevalence ranging 3.3-40 cases per million and annual incidence ranging 0.34-2.4 cases per million.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;The prevalence and incidence of TAK in Shanghai was at moderate to high levels among the previous reports. The disease burden varied globally among racial populations.</td>\n",

Aims were to calculate prevalence and incidence in Switzerland, to assess disease activity and performance of MR-Angiography (MRA).&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;31 patients were recorded in a database, 27 were followed prospectively up to 3 years. Prevalence was calculated based on data of the national statistical bureau. Disease activity was defined using the revised EULAR criteria. MRA depicted stenotic changes and aortic wall enhancement.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;A disease prevalence of 14.5/1.000.000 inhabitants and an incidence of 0.3/1.000.000 per year was calculated. Aortic wall enhancement was found in 10 patients while in clinical and serological remission. EULAR criteria missed 5 patients with disease activity with isolated elevations of ESR/CRP. Arterial stenosis did not change over time in 5 cases, it improved in 2 and increased in 7. At follow-up 16 patients were treated with tocilizumab, 11/16 in monotherapy, 5 patients were treatment-free, 25/27 stayed in remission.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;In addition to prevalence and incidence, our data show that MRA qualifies to detect subclinical disease activity, but, on the other hand, that EULAR criteria may miss disease activity in case of isolated elevation of ESR/CRP.</td>\n",

Takayasu arteritis (TA) sometimes presents with colitis, which may be diagnosed as inflammatory bowel disease unclassified (IBDU) because of atypical or mixed findings of ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease. We herein report an 18-year-old girl presenting with colitis with an occasional high fever eventually diagnosed as TA with IBDU. Colonic inflammation was initially discontinuous and stronger in the proximal colon, atypical of UC. However, over 10-year observation, the distribution of colonic inflammation varied and became UC-like. Variations in TA-related colonic inflammations over time have been unclear. Our long-term observation might help clarify the details of TA-related colonic inflammation.</td>\n",

Takayasu arteritis (TA) is a chronic, idiopathic large-vessel vasculitis that affects women of reproductive age, and has significant maternal and fetal implications. Although there are contrasting data on the effect of TA on fertility, most studies have shown that fertility outcomes remain unaffected. The disease activity of TA usually either remains stable or decreases during pregnancy. The important fetomaternal complications are maternal hypertension, pre-eclampsia, prematurity, and intrauterine growth restriction. To reduce maternal and fetal morbidity, controlling the disease before conception is important. This review article discusses the various implications, challenges, and medical and endovascular management of TA during pregnancy.</td>\n",

       "2  Epidemiology of Takayasu arteritis in Shanghai: A hospital-based study and systematic review. <h4>Background</h4>Takayasu arteritis (TAK) is a rare large vessel vasculitis, and epidemiological data on TAK are lacking in China. Thus, we designed this study to estimate the TAK prevalence and incidence in residential Shanghai, China.<h4>Methods</h4>Data on diagnosed TAK cases aged over 16 years were retrieved from 22 tertiary hospitals in Shanghai through hospital electronic medical record systems between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2017 to estimate the prevalence and incidence. A systematic literature review based on searches in PubMed, Ovid-Medline, Excerpta Medica Database (EMBASE), Web of Science, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) was performed to summarize TAK distribution across the world.<h4>Results</h4>In total 102 TAK patients, with 64% female, were identified. The point prevalence (2015-2017) was 7.01 (95% CI 5.65-8.37) cases per million, and the mean annual incidence was 2.33 (1.97-3.21) cases per million. The average age of TAK patients was 44 ± 16 years, with the highest prevalence (11.59 [9.23-19.50] cases per million) and incidence (3.55 [0.72 3.74] cases per million) in the 16 to 34 years population. Seventeen reports were included in the system review, showing that the epidemiology of TAK varied greatly across the world. The incidence and prevalence were both relatively higher in Asian countries, with the prevalence ranging 3.3-40 cases per million and annual incidence ranging 0.34-2.4 cases per million.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The prevalence and incidence of TAK in Shanghai was at moderate to high levels among the previous reports. The disease burden varied globally among racial populations.   \n",

Aims were to calculate prevalence and incidence in Switzerland, to assess disease activity and performance of MR-Angiography (MRA).<h4>Methods</h4>31 patients were recorded in a database, 27 were followed prospectively up to 3 years. Prevalence was calculated based on data of the national statistical bureau. Disease activity was defined using the revised EULAR criteria. MRA depicted stenotic changes and aortic wall enhancement.<h4>Results</h4>A disease prevalence of 14.5/1.000.000 inhabitants and an incidence of 0.3/1.000.000 per year was calculated. Aortic wall enhancement was found in 10 patients while in clinical and serological remission. EULAR criteria missed 5 patients with disease activity with isolated elevations of ESR/CRP. Arterial stenosis did not change over time in 5 cases, it improved in 2 and increased in 7. At follow-up 16 patients were treated with tocilizumab, 11/16 in monotherapy, 5 patients were treatment-free, 25/27 stayed in remission.<h4>Conclusion</h4>In addition to prevalence and incidence, our data show that MRA qualifies to detect subclinical disease activity, but, on the other hand, that EULAR criteria may miss disease activity in case of isolated elevation of ESR/CRP.   \n",

Takayasu arteritis (TA) sometimes presents with colitis, which may be diagnosed as inflammatory bowel disease unclassified (IBDU) because of atypical or mixed findings of ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease. We herein report an 18-year-old girl presenting with colitis with an occasional high fever eventually diagnosed as TA with IBDU. Colonic inflammation was initially discontinuous and stronger in the proximal colon, atypical of UC. However, over 10-year observation, the distribution of colonic inflammation varied and became UC-like. Variations in TA-related colonic inflammations over time have been unclear. Our long-term observation might help clarify the details of TA-related colonic inflammation.   \n",

Takayasu arteritis (TA) is a chronic, idiopathic large-vessel vasculitis that affects women of reproductive age, and has significant maternal and fetal implications. Although there are contrasting data on the effect of TA on fertility, most studies have shown that fertility outcomes remain unaffected. The disease activity of TA usually either remains stable or decreases during pregnancy. The important fetomaternal complications are maternal hypertension, pre-eclampsia, prematurity, and intrauterine growth restriction. To reduce maternal and fetal morbidity, controlling the disease before conception is important. This review article discusses the various implications, challenges, and medical and endovascular management of TA during pregnancy.   \n",

       "      <td>The first Saudi baby with classic homocystinuria diagnosed by universal newborn screening. Classic homocystinuria (CH) is an inborn error of metabolism caused by cystathionine beta-synthase enzyme deficiency. Affected patients present with intellectual disability and other comorbidities. If diagnosed early in infancy and started treatment, inevitable complications can be prevented. Newborn screening (NBS) uses tandem mass-spectroscopy (MSMS) to measure the amino acid levels. In CH, the first-tier screening test is the measurement of methionine by MSMS. If methionine remained elevated in the recall sample, plasma level for homocysteine is performed. A newborn infant underwent routine NBS in our institute that showed elevated methionine in the first and the recall sample. Thereafter, total serum homocysteine was found to be elevated, consistent with the diagnosis of CH. An early medical and dietary management was commenced for this first Saudi baby diagnosed with homocystinuria by universal NBS. This report demonstrates that NBS for CH is feasible and effective in preventing the disease burden.</td>\n",

Kuwait is a small Arabian Gulf country with a high rate of consanguinity and where a national newborn screening program was expanded in October 2014 to include a wide range of endocrine and metabolic disorders. A retrospective study conducted between January 2015 and December 2020 revealed a total of 304,086 newborns have been screened in Kuwait. Six newborns were diagnosed with classic homocystinuria with an incidence of 1:50,000, which is not as high as in Qatar but higher than the global incidence. Molecular testing for five of them has revealed three previously reported pathogenic variants in the &lt;i&gt;CBS&lt;/i&gt; gene, c.969G&gt;A, p.(Trp323Ter); c.982G&gt;A, p.(Asp328Asn); and the Qatari founder variant c.1006C&gt;T, p.(Arg336Cys). This is the first study to review the screening of newborns in Kuwait for classic homocystinuria, starting with the detection of elevated blood methionine and providing a follow-up strategy for positive results, including plasma total homocysteine and amino acid analyses. Further, we have demonstrated an increase in the specificity of the current newborn screening test for classic homocystinuria by including the methionine to phenylalanine ratio along with the elevated methionine blood levels in first-tier testing. Here, we provide evidence that the newborn screening in Kuwait has led to the early detection of classic homocystinuria cases and enabled the affected individuals to lead active and productive lives.</td>\n",

Classic homocystinuria (CH) is an inborn error of metabolism caused by cystathionine beta-synthase enzyme deficiency. Affected patients present with intellectual disability and other comorbidities. If diagnosed early in infancy and started treatment, inevitable complications can be prevented. Newborn screening (NBS) uses tandem mass-spectroscopy (MSMS) to measure the amino acid levels. In CH, the first-tier screening test is the measurement of methionine by MSMS. If methionine remained elevated in the recall sample, plasma level for homocysteine is performed. A newborn infant underwent routine NBS in our institute that showed elevated methionine in the first and the recall sample. Thereafter, total serum homocysteine was found to be elevated, consistent with the diagnosis of CH. An early medical and dietary management was commenced for this first Saudi baby diagnosed with homocystinuria by universal NBS. This report demonstrates that NBS for CH is feasible and effective in preventing the disease burden.   \n",

       "      <td>Screening for autosomal recessive and X-linked conditions during pregnancy and preconception: a practice resource of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG). Carrier screening began 50 years ago with screening for conditions that have a high prevalence in defined racial/ethnic groups (e.g., Tay-Sachs disease in the Ashkenazi Jewish population; sickle cell disease in Black individuals). Cystic fibrosis was the first medical condition for which panethnic screening was recommended, followed by spinal muscular atrophy. Next-generation sequencing allows low cost and high throughput identification of sequence variants across many genes simultaneously. Since the phrase \"expanded carrier screening\" is nonspecific, there is a need to define carrier screening processes in a way that will allow equitable opportunity for patients to learn their reproductive risks using next-generation sequencing technology. An improved understanding of this risk allows patients to make informed reproductive decisions. Reproductive decision making is the established metric for clinical utility of population-based carrier screening. Furthermore, standardization of the screening approach will facilitate testing consistency. This practice resource reviews the current status of carrier screening, provides answers to some of the emerging questions, and recommends a consistent and equitable approach for offering carrier screening to all individuals during pregnancy or preconception.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Prenatal Diagnosis of Tay-Sachs Disease. Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations of the HEXA gene resulting in the deficiency of hexosaminidase A (Hex A) and subsequent neuronal accumulation of G&lt;sub&gt;M2&lt;/sub&gt; gangliosides. Infantile TSD is a devastating and fetal neurodegenerative disease with death before the age of 3-5 years. A small proportion of TSD patients carry milder mutations and may present juvenile or adult onset milder disease. TSD is more prevalent among Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) individuals and some other genetically isolated populations with carrier frequencies of approximately ~1:27 which is much higher than that of 1:300 in the general population. Carrier screening and prenatal testing for TSD are effective in preventing the birth of affected fetuses greatly diminishing the incidence of TSD. Testing of targeted HEXA mutations by genotyping or sequencing can detect 98% of carriers in AJ individuals; however, the detection rate is much lower for most other ethnic groups. When combined with enzyme analysis, above 98% of carriers can be reliably identified regardless of ethnic background. Multiplex PCR followed by allele-specific primer extension is one method to test for known and common mutations. Sanger sequencing or other sequencing methods are useful to identify private mutations. For prenatal testing, only predefined parental mutations need to be tested. In the event of unknown mutational status or the presence of variants of unknown significance (VUS), enzyme analysis must be performed in conjunction with DNA-based assays to enhance the diagnostic accuracy. Enzymatic assays involve the use of synthetic substrates 4-methylumbelliferyl-N-acetyl-β-glucosamine (4-MUG) and 4-methylumbelliferyl-6-sulfo-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-β-D-glucopyranoside (4-MUGS) to measure the percentage Hex A activity (Hex A%) and specific Hex A activity respectively. These biochemical and molecular tests can be performed in both direct specimens and cultured cells from chorionic villi sampling or amniocentesis.</td>\n",

Carrier screening began 50 years ago with screening for conditions that have a high prevalence in defined racial/ethnic groups (e.g., Tay-Sachs disease in the Ashkenazi Jewish population; sickle cell disease in Black individuals). Cystic fibrosis was the first medical condition for which panethnic screening was recommended, followed by spinal muscular atrophy. Next-generation sequencing allows low cost and high throughput identification of sequence variants across many genes simultaneously. Since the phrase \"expanded carrier screening\" is nonspecific, there is a need to define carrier screening processes in a way that will allow equitable opportunity for patients to learn their reproductive risks using next-generation sequencing technology. An improved understanding of this risk allows patients to make informed reproductive decisions. Reproductive decision making is the established metric for clinical utility of population-based carrier screening. Furthermore, standardization of the screening approach will facilitate testing consistency. This practice resource reviews the current status of carrier screening, provides answers to some of the emerging questions, and recommends a consistent and equitable approach for offering carrier screening to all individuals during pregnancy or preconception.   \n",
       "1  Prenatal Diagnosis of Tay-Sachs Disease. Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations of the HEXA gene resulting in the deficiency of hexosaminidase A (Hex A) and subsequent neuronal accumulation of G<sub>M2</sub> gangliosides. Infantile TSD is a devastating and fetal neurodegenerative disease with death before the age of 3-5 years. A small proportion of TSD patients carry milder mutations and may present juvenile or adult onset milder disease. TSD is more prevalent among Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) individuals and some other genetically isolated populations with carrier frequencies of approximately ~1:27 which is much higher than that of 1:300 in the general population. Carrier screening and prenatal testing for TSD are effective in preventing the birth of affected fetuses greatly diminishing the incidence of TSD. Testing of targeted HEXA mutations by genotyping or sequencing can detect 98% of carriers in AJ individuals; however, the detection rate is much lower for most other ethnic groups. When combined with enzyme analysis, above 98% of carriers can be reliably identified regardless of ethnic background. Multiplex PCR followed by allele-specific primer extension is one method to test for known and common mutations. Sanger sequencing or other sequencing methods are useful to identify private mutations. For prenatal testing, only predefined parental mutations need to be tested. In the event of unknown mutational status or the presence of variants of unknown significance (VUS), enzyme analysis must be performed in conjunction with DNA-based assays to enhance the diagnostic accuracy. Enzymatic assays involve the use of synthetic substrates 4-methylumbelliferyl-N-acetyl-β-glucosamine (4-MUG) and 4-methylumbelliferyl-6-sulfo-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-β-D-glucopyranoside (4-MUGS) to measure the percentage Hex A activity (Hex A%) and specific Hex A activity respectively. These biochemical and molecular tests can be performed in both direct specimens and cultured cells from chorionic villi sampling or amniocentesis.   \n",

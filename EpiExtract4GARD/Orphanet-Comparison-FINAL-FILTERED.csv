93,Aspartylglucosaminuria,Prevalence at birth,1-9 / 100 000,3.35,Finland,27906067,"Aspartylglycosaminuria: a review. Aspartylglucosaminuria (AGU), a recessively inherited lysosomal storage disease, is the most common disorder of glycoprotein degradation with a high prevalence in the Finnish population. It is a lifelong condition affecting on the patient's appearance, cognition, adaptive skills, physical growth, personality, body structure, and health. An infantile growth spurt and development of macrocephalia associated to hernias and respiratory infections are the key signs to an early identification of AGU. Progressive intellectual and physical disability is the main symptom leading to death usually before the age of 50 years.The disease is caused by the deficient activity of the lysosomal enzyme glycosylasparaginase (aspartylglucosaminidase, AGA), which leads to a disorder in the degradation of glycoasparagines - aspartylglucosamine or other glycoconjugates with an aspartylglucosamine moiety at their reducing end - and accumulation of these undegraded glycoasparagines in tissues and body fluids. A single nucleotide change in the AGA gene resulting in a cysteine to serine substitution (C163S) in the AGA enzyme protein causes the deficiency of the glycosylasparaginase activity in the Finnish population. Homozygosity for the single nucleotide change causing the C163S mutation is responsible for 98% of the AGU cases in Finland simplifying the carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis of the disorder in the Finnish population. A mouse strain, which completely lacks the Aga activity has been generated through targeted disruption of the Aga gene in embryonic stem cells. These Aga-deficient mice share most of the clinical, histopathologic and biochemical characteristics of human AGU disease. Treatment of AGU mice with recombinant AGA resulted in rapid correction of the pathophysiologic characteristics of AGU in non-neuronal tissues of the animals. The accumulation of aspartylglucosamine was reduced by up to 40% in the brain tissue of the animals depending on the age of the animals and the therapeutic protocol. Enzyme replacement trials on human AGU patients have not been reported so far. Allogenic stem cell transplantation has not proved effective in curing AGU.",['GARD:0005854'],"{'Aspartylglucosaminuria', 'Aspartylglycosaminuria'}",{'finland'},{'prevalence'},['40']
349,Fucosidosis,Point prevalence,<1 / 1 000 000,0.0,Worldwide,10094192,"Spectrum of mutations in fucosidosis. Fucosidosis is a lysosomal storage disorder characterised by progressive psychomotor deterioration, angiokeratoma and growth retardation. It is due to deficient alpha-l-fucosidase activity leading to accumulation of fucose-containing glycolipids and glycoproteins in various tissues. Fucosidosis is extremely rare with less than 100 patients reported worldwide, although the disease occurs at a higher rate in Italy, in the Hispanic-American population of New Mexico and Colorado, and in Cuba. We present here a review study of the mutational spectrum of fucosidosis. Exon by exon mutation analysis of FUCA1, the structural gene of alpha-l-fucosidase, has identified the mutation(s) in nearly all fucosidosis patients investigated. The spectrum of the 22 mutations detected to date includes four missense mutations, 17 nonsense mutations consisting of seven stop codon mutations, six small deletions, two large deletions, one duplication, one small insertion and one splice site mutation. All these mutations lead to nearly absent enzymatic activity and severely reduced cross-reacting immunomaterial. The observed clinical variability is, therefore, not due to the nature of the fucosidosis mutation, but to secondary unknown factors.",['GARD:0006473'],"{'Fucosidosis', 'fucosidosis'}","{'colorado', 'worldwide', 'italy', 'new mexico', 'cuba'}",{'occurs'},['less']

The short-term probability of receiving an additional diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is also assessed.<h4>Methods</h4>A population-based open cohort study including all patients with CLE [International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code, ICD-10: L93] in Sweden, 2005-2007. Patients (n=1088) were identified in the Swedish National Patient Register.<h4>Results</h4>The incidence of CLE was 4·0/100,000; the female/male ratio was 3:1. Mean age at disease onset was 54 years. The most common subset was discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) (80%, n = 868). A quarter of the patients (24%, n=260) were already diagnosed with SLE at the time they were diagnosed with CLE. During the whole observation period (2005-2007), an additional 18% (n = 107) were diagnosed with SLE, the probability of receiving an additional SLE diagnosis being highest for the subacute CLE (SCLE) subset.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This is the first nationwide epidemiological study on CLE. We found the incidence of CLE to be about equal to that of SLE, and found a higher short-term probability for receiving an additional diagnosis with SLE than previously described for CLE. Subsets other than DLE and SCLE were rarely reported in our system; an update of the ICD codes for this diagnostic group could increase reporting of these more unusual cases. Our study clarifies that monitoring and follow-up are called for in this patient group due to the risk for SLE, and underscores the need for clear criteria for risk assessment in the large group of patients with CLE who also fulfil criteria for SLE.",['GARD:0006225'],"{'Cutaneous lupus erythematosus', 'cutaneous lupus erythematosus'}",{'sweden'},{'incidence'},"['4 · 0 / 100 , 000']"

Mucolipidosis (ML) II (I-cell disease) is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine:lysosomal enzyme N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase. MLII is an autosomal recessive disease with a carrier rate estimated at 1/39 in Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean (SLSJ) (Quebec, Canada), which is the highest frequency documented worldwide. To identify the causing mutation, we sequenced GNPTAB exons in 27 parents of 16 MLII-deceased children from the SLSJ region as obligatory and potential carriers. We also performed a genealogical reconstruction for each parent to evaluate consanguinity levels and genetic contribution of ancestors. Our goal was to identify which parameters could explain the high MLII frequency observed in the SLSJ population. A single mutation (c.3503_3504delTC) was found in all obligatory carriers. In addition, 11 apparent polymorphisms were identified. The mutation was not detected in genomic DNA of 50 unrelated controls. Genealogical data show six founders (three couples) with a higher probability of having introduced the mutation in the population. The frequency of the mutation was increased as a consequence of this founder effect and of the resulting population structure. We suggest that c.3503_3504delTC is the allele causing MLII in the SLSJ population, and its high carrier rate is most likely explained by a founder effect.",[],set(),"{'canada', 'worldwide', 'quebe'}",set(),['1 / 39']

Patients with cryptogenic and symptomatic focal epilepsies were excluded. Sex, age, familial history, type of seizures and AED treatment were noted and EEG monitoring, MRI and CT scanning, and developmental and psychomotor evolution were investigated.<h4>Results</h4>Patients included five males and two females. All patients suffered from seizures during wakefulness. Two of the patients (29%) did not have a recurrence. Five (71%) had sporadic seizures (ranging between two and five). One of the seven patients (14%) presented with seizures in clusters. During seizures, staring was observed in six (86%), motion arrest in five (71%), stiffening in five (71%), cyanosis in three (42%), automatisms in one (14%) and lateralizing signs in four (57%). Two patients (29%) had secondary generalisation. The duration of the seizures ranged between 30 seconds and five minutes. No status epilepticus was observed. The interictal EEG recording during sleep showed low-voltage unilateral or bilateral spikes located in the central and vertex regions, followed by slow waves in all patients. Outcome was excellent in all patients.<h4>Conclusion</h4>We believe that BIMSE is a new syndrome rather than an early presentation of benign epilepsy of childhood with centrotemporal spikes, Panayiotopoulos syndrome, or a late presentation of benign focal infantile seizures.",['GARD:0010191'],{'status epilepticus'},{'Worldwide'},set(),['one']

Seizures were generalized in 32 cases. Single seizures in 15 cases were <5 min and multiple seizures 24-48 h after seizure onset were seen in 18 cases. Seizure duration was <1 min in 32.35%, between 1 and 5 min in 55.88%, and between 5 and 10 min in 8.82% of seizures. The average interval between the onset of gastroenteritis and seizures was 2.47 days. Rotavirus antigen was positive in stools in 26.47% of cases. During the acute phase, diazepam and phenobarbital as first-line treatment were effective in 25% and 83.33% of cases, respectively. Fourteen patients showed non-specific anomalies in the interictal electroencephalography. During 12-36 months follow-up, 33 cases showed normal psychomotor development and no seizures.<h4>Conclusions</h4>CwG occurred mostly in toddlers.

95,Friedreich ataxia,Point prevalence,1-9 / 100 000,2.0,Europe,20301458,"Friedreich Ataxia <h4>Clinical characteristics</h4>Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is characterized by slowly progressive ataxia with onset usually before age 25 years (mean age at onset: 10-15 yrs). FRDA is typically associated with dysarthria, muscle weakness, spasticity particularly in the lower limbs, scoliosis, bladder dysfunction, absent lower-limb reflexes, and loss of position and vibration sense. Approximately two thirds of individuals with FRDA have cardiomyopathy, up to 30% have diabetes mellitus, and approximately 25% have an ""atypical"" presentation with later onset or retained tendon reflexes.<h4>Diagnosis/testing</h4>The diagnosis of FRDA is established in a proband by detection of biallelic pathogenic variants in FXN. The most common type of variant, which is observed on both alleles in approximately 96% of individuals with FRDA, is an abnormally expanded GAA repeat in intron 1 of FXN. The remaining individuals with FRDA are compound heterozygotes for an abnormally expanded GAA repeat in the disease-causing range on one allele and another intragenic pathogenic variant on the other allele.<h4>Management</h4>Treatment of manifestations: Clinical management guidelines have been published. Prostheses; walking aids and wheelchairs for mobility; speech, occupational, and physical therapy; pharmacologic agents for spasticity; orthopedic interventions for scoliosis and foot deformities; hearing devices for auditory involvement; dietary modifications and placement of a nasogastric tube or gastrostomy for dysphagia; antiarrhythmic agents, anti-cardiac failure medications, anticoagulants, and pacemaker for cardiac disease; dietary modification, oral hypoglycemic agents or insulin for diabetes mellitus; antispasmodics for bladder dysfunction; continuous positive pressure for obstructive sleep apnea; psychological support, both pharmacologic and counseling. Prevention of secondary manifestations: Active management of spasticity to prevent permanent contractures; aggressive treatment of scoliosis to prevent cardiopulmonary complications; treatment of diabetes to avoid complications related to inadequate treatment; treatment of cardiac complications to avoid arrhythmias; treatment of sleep apnea to present neurologic and cardiopulmonary complications of untreated sleep apnea. Surveillance: At least annual assessment of overall status; examination for complications including spasticity, scoliosis, and foot deformity; annual ECG, echocardiogram, and fasting blood sugar to monitor for diabetes mellitus; hearing assessment every two to three years; a low threshold for sleep study to investigate for obstructive sleep apnea. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Environments that place an individual at risk for falls such as rough surfaces for ambulant individuals; excessive use of alcohol, which can increase ataxia; medications (e.g., isoniazid, nitrofurantoin) that are known to cause nerve damage. Therapies under investigation: Idebenone, histone deacetylase inhibitors, EPI-743, PPAR gamma agonists, nicotinamide, resveratrol, thiamine.<h4>Genetic counseling</h4>FRDA is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of having no pathogenic variant. Carrier testing of at-risk relatives, prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk, and preimplantation genetic testing are possible if both FXN pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member.",['GARD:0006468'],"{'Friedreich ataxia', 'Friedreich Ataxia'}",{'Worldwide'},set(),['30']

Friedreich ataxia (FA) is an autosomal recessive, neurodegenerative disorder characterized by polypurine trinucleotide expansion. The (GAA)n motif is located in intron 18 of the STM7 gene (previously considered as intron 1 of the X25 gene) on chromosome 9q13. We studied the distribution profile of the polymorphic (GAA)n repetitive tract in 178 healthy individuals. The number of repeats of the trinucleotide block ranged from 7 to 29. In three individuals there were more than 29 repetitions of the GAA motif. While two of the individuals would be diagnosed as carriers of the FA mutation (GAA size > 90), the status of the third person, with a (GAA)58 tract, appears less clear at present. Thus an FA carrier rate of 1/60 to 1/90 can be assumed for the German population. In addition an intermediate-sized allele, (GAA)38 was identified in a mother with two affected children. The (GAA)38 allele appears to be expanded during transmission to at least (GAA)66 and (GAA) > 400 in her two FA-affected offspring. Therefore the shortest known STM7 allele conferring FA is (GAA)66.

Although affecting only 4-5% of those with cystic fibrosis (CF), the G551D-CFTR mutation is the target of the recently approved 'orphan drug', ivacaftor. The promise of such genomically guided therapies heralds a new era in the management of CF. A phase 3 trial demonstrated significant improvements in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)) from baseline, average weight gain, concentration in sweat chloride and reductions in pulmonary exacerbations [Ramsey, B.W., et al. A CFTR potentiator in patients with CF and the G551D mutation. N. Engl. J. Med., 2011. 365: 1663-1672.)]. Ivacaftor is among a group of recently approved, novel, mutation guided 'orphan drug' therapies that have established clinical benefits within their respective disease categories. They do not, however, offer a cure. Pharmaceutical and biotech companies have leveraged the incentivized benefits of the Orphan Drug Act to develop more of these drugs for orphan disorders affecting populations of <200 000 patients. With marked clinical efficacy via DNA sequence guidance, these drugs have also set a precedent in terms of the substantial annual costs and if this trend continues, such expenditures may become unsustainable. This paper explores the genomic pathophysiology of CF and how therapies such as ivacaftor provide benefit to those with the disease but at a considerably elevated price point.",['GARD:0006233'],"{'cystic fibrosis', 'Cystic fibrosis'}",{'Worldwide'},set(),['4']

Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is an autosomal dominant disease associated with a partial deletion on chromosome 4q35. Few relevant investigations have been reported on its epidemiology and were essentially based on clinical diagnosis, having been performed before recognition of the molecular mutation. We report an epidemiological survey on FSHD patients, in which the diagnosis was obtained by combined clinical and molecular evaluation. The survey concerned the north-east Italian province of Padova, an area of 871,190 inhabitants (1 January 2004). We identified 40 patients affected by FSHD based on clinical diagnosis. In 33 of them, the EcoRI fragment size in the 4q35 region ranged from 14 to 35 kb. Four other patients belonging to the same family harbored a 38-kb fragment. In these four cases, the relationship between the borderline deletion with the mild FSHD phenotype was corroborated by additional haplotype reconstruction and segregation analysis. Interestingly, the same mild facial-sparing clinical pattern was apparent only in one other patient with an EcoRI fragment of 32 kb, suggesting that this unusual FSHD phenotype may be due to very small 4q35 deletions. On the whole, estimating a prevalence rate of 44 x 10(-6), our survey confirmed FSHD as one of the most frequent neuromuscular disorders in Western populations.",['GARD:0009941'],{'Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy'},{'padova'},{'prevalence'},['44 x 10']

Nevertheless, a clear understanding of its prevalence remains an important goal, particularly about planning appropriate clinical services. Consequently, the aim of this study was to accurately define the prevalence of mtDNA disease (primary mutation occurs in mtDNA) in the working-age population of the North East of England.<h4>Methods</h4>Adults with suspected mitochondrial disease in the North East of England were referred to a single neurology center for investigation from 1990 to 2004. Those with pathogenic mtDNA mutations were identified and pedigree analysis performed. For the midyear period of 2001, we calculated the minimum point prevalence of mtDNA disease for adults of working age (>16 and <60/65 years for female/male patients, respectively).<h4>Results</h4>In this population, we found that 9.2 in 100,000 people have clinically manifest mtDNA disease, making this one of the commonest inherited neuromuscular disorders. In addition, a further 16.5 in 100,000 children and adults younger than retirement age are at risk for development of mtDNA disease.<h4>Interpretation</h4>Through detailed pedigree analysis and active family tracing, we have been able to provide revised minimum prevalence figures for mtDNA disease.

A total of 96 subjects belonging to 26 families were identified as DM1 patients, which gave a minimal disease prevalence of 0.46/100,000 inhabitants. Clinical anticipation was frequently observed in affected families, even in some parent-child pairs with transmission contraction of the CTG repeat size. The inverse correlation between age at onset and CTG repeat length was significant only in patients with small expansions. In addition, a DM1 carrier with a childhood-onset son was found to have CTG length heterogeneity in the range of 40-50, indicating that premutation alleles could be unstable during gametogenesis as well as in somatic tissues.

Here we describe the clinical and molecular characterisation of a family with a syndromic form of XLMR with hypogonadism and short stature. We investigated a family in which four male members in two generations presented with hypergonadotrophic hypogonadism associated with development of small and abnormal testes. In two of the males, late-onset testicular ascent was noted. In addition, all affected males had short stature (<0.4th centile) and mild learning difficulties and three out of the four had microcephaly. Karyotypes were normal and endocrine investigations confirmed primary testicular failure. The phenotype segregated as an X-linked trait.

Gastrostomy tube (GT) feedings are commonly recommended to manage these co-morbidities. In general, outcomes of GT placement in patients with progressive diseases that develop during childhood are not well characterized. The primary purposes of this study were to determine whether GT placement in patients with A-T would be tolerated and associated with caregiver satisfaction.<h4>Methods</h4>We completed a retrospective review of 175 patients who visited the A-T Children's Center at Johns Hopkins Hospital from 2001 through 2008, and identified 28 patients with A-T (19 males, 9 females) who underwent GT placement for non-palliative reasons. Information was obtained from medical records, interviews with primary health care providers, and 24 (83%) caregivers of patients with GT's who responded to survey requests.<h4>Results</h4>Twenty-five (89%) patients tolerated GT placement and were a median of 5.0 (0.4-12.6) years post GT placement at the time of this investigation. Three (11%) patients died within one month of GT placement. In comparison to patients who tolerated GT placement, patients with early mortality were older when GT's were placed (median 24.9 vs. 12.3 years, p = 0.006) and had developed a combination of dysphagia, nutritional, and respiratory problems. Caregivers of patients tolerating GT placement reported significant improvements in mealtime satisfaction and participation in daily activities.<h4>Conclusions</h4>GT placement can be well tolerated and associated with easier mealtimes in patients with A-T when feeding tubes are placed at young ages.

Only four (4.7%) of these individuals developed their symptoms after the age of 60 years. A subsequent retrospective search of the register identified a total of 33 individuals with clinical evidence of Huntington's disease and whose age of onset of symptoms occurred between the ages of 60 and 77 years. In this group the median time for disease duration from the onset of symptoms was 13 years (range 0.5-25 years), with survival up to age 86 years recorded. Initial symptoms of Huntington's disease included disturbance of gait in 32 individuals; 31 had involuntary movements, and 20 had abnormality of speech. Major psychiatric symptoms were present in only six cases; but approximately a third (ten cases) had symptoms related to impaired cognitive function. Molecular analysis was possible on ten individuals in the series. The expanded CAG repeat sequence in the Huntington's disease gene was found in all cases, with a narrow range of 36-38 repeats, representing the smallest repeats seen in our Huntington's disease group. Our study suggests that Huntington's disease in elderly people causes predominantly motor disturbance at onset with relatively mild disability and a favourable outlook for both independent living and for life expectancy. However, the potential for under-diagnosis in this age group may have considerable genetic consequences, with transmission of the disorder to numerous descendants by the time its hereditary nature is recognized.",[],set(),"{'south wales', 'south east wales', 'mid glamorgan', 'gwen', 'south glamorgan'}",{'prevalence'},['6 . 2 / 100']

DRPLA has a marked ethnic predilection, most commonly reported in Japan and thought to be rare in Caucasian populations.<h4>Methods</h4>We describe the clinical and genetic characteristics of 17 patients with DRPLA segregating in four families in South Wales.<h4>Results</h4>There was marked clinical heterogeneity with considerable overlap of symptoms and signs between and within families. The age of onset ranged from 34 to 60 years with an earlier onset associated with myoclonic epilepsy and a later onset associated with a Huntington disease-like presentation. We identified a distinct haplotype within one family not present within the other three families, suggesting that the expansion in at least one family did not arise from an immediate common ancestor. Analysis of repeat length polymorphisms in 306 Welsh control patients identified 14 (4.6%) with repeat lengths in the high-normal range, compared with 0% and 7.4% in previously reported north American Caucasian and Japanese control populations, respectively.<h4>Conclusions</h4>DRPLA may not be as geographically or ethnically restricted as previously thought and the diagnosis should be considered in non-Asian patients presenting with a wide spectrum of neurological disease, especially if there is a dominant family history of dementia or movement disorder. The prevalence of high-normal length alleles may account for the relatively high prevalence of DRPLA in Wales.",['GARD:0005643'],{'DRPLA'},"{'south wales', 'wales', 'japan'}",{'prevalence'},['14']

The fact that none of our patients, despite previous examinations, had correct diagnoses before 1995, indicates that Kennedy's disease still might be relatively underdiagnosed.",[],set(),"{'finland', 'western finland', 'v'}",{'prevalence'},"['13 patients per 85 , 000 male inhabitants']"

Quantification of homocysteine was linear over a working range up to 50 micromol/L. For mutation analysis, DNA was tested for 2 mutations common in Qatar.<h4>Results</h4>Both methods proved to be suitable for high throughput processing. In 2 years, 7 infants with classic homocystinuria were identified of 12,603 native Qatari infants, yielding an incidence of 1:1800. Molecular screening would have missed 1 patient homozygous for a mutation not previously identified in the Qatari population. Over a period of 3 years, a total of 14 cases of classic homocystinuria were detected by screening of homocysteine from all newborn infants born in Qatar (n = 46 406). Homocysteine was always elevated, whereas methionine was elevated in only 7 cases.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The study offers a reliable method for newborn screening for cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency, reaching a sensitivity of up to 100%, even if samples are taken within the first 3 days of life.",['GARD:0006667'],"{'cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency', 'classic homocystinuria'}","{'qata', 'qatar'}",{'incidence'},['100']

Counting the unaffected family members has been possible thanks to accessible genealogical records, and this has improved the accuracy of our penetrance figures by minimizing the sample bias. Our results, although confirming some well-known features of LHON, indicate that the overall penetrance of LHON is lower than previously estimated, and that affected females have a higher incidence of affected offspring compared to the unaffected females.

About half of people with NF1 have plexiform neurofibromas, but most are internal and not suspected clinically. Learning disabilities are present in at least 50% of individuals with NF1. Less common but potentially more serious manifestations include optic nerve and other central nervous system gliomas, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, scoliosis, tibial dysplasia, and vasculopathy.<h4>Diagnosis/testing</h4>The diagnosis of NF1 is usually based on clinical findings. Heterozygous pathogenic variants in NF1 are responsible for neurofibromatosis 1. Molecular genetic testing of NF1 is rarely needed for diagnosis.<h4>Management</h4>Treatment of manifestations: Referral to specialists for treatment of complications involving the eye, central or peripheral nervous system, cardiovascular system, endocrine system, spine, or long bones; surgical removal of disfiguring or uncomfortable discrete cutaneous or subcutaneous neurofibromas. Surgical treatment of plexiform neurofibromas is often unsatisfactory. Complete surgical excision, when possible, of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors. Treatment of optic gliomas is generally unnecessary as they are usually asymptomatic and clinically stable. Dystrophic scoliosis often requires surgical management, whereas nondystrophic scoliosis can usually be treated conservatively. Methylphenidate treatment often benefits children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Surveillance: Annual physical examination by a physician familiar with the disorder; annual ophthalmologic examination in children, less frequently in adults; regular developmental assessment of children; regular blood pressure monitoring; MRI for follow up of clinically suspected intracranial tumors and other internal tumors. Begin annual mammography in women at age 30 with consideration of annual breast MRI in women between ages 30 and 50 years.<h4>Genetic counseling</h4>NF1 is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Half of affected individuals have NF1 as the result of a de novoNF1 pathogenic variant. The offspring of an affected individual are at a 50% risk of inheriting the altered NF1 allele, but the disease manifestations are extremely variable, even within a family. Prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible if the pathogenic variant in a family is known.",['GARD:0010420'],"{'Neurofibromatosis', 'neurofibromatosis'}",{'Worldwide'},set(),['50']

AFP deficiency is rare (estimated to be 1/105,000 newborns) and only one sequence alteration has previously been reported in the AFP gene. We report a new mutation in exon 5 of the AFP gene, leading to a total absence of AFP on 2nd-trimester maternal serum screening for Down syndrome, confirmed on the amniotic fluid. Despite this, fetal development and birth were normal. After PCR-amplification, the whole AFP gene was sequenced. The new mutation was a guanine to adenine transition in position 543 creating a premature stop codon in position 181. In order to search for eventual modifications of the amniotic fluid profile, proteins were separated by electrophoresis and compared with 10 normal amniotic fluids sampled at the same developmental age (18 weeks). In the amniotic fluid of our patient albumin rate was reduced whereas alpha1 and beta protein fractions were increased, suggesting that AFP deficiency may modify the distribution of protein fractions.

Bloom syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized clinically by small size, sun-sensitive facial erythema, and immunodeficiency, and cytogenetically by increased chromosome breakage and sister chromatid exchange. Genomic instability renders Bloom syndrome patients at elevated risk for multiple cancers. Bloom syndrome occurs most commonly in the Ashkenazi Jewish population due to an apparent founder effect.

Primary fallopian tube carcinoma (PFTC) is rare, constituting about 1% of female genital tract malignancies, and little is known about its etiological, protective, risk or prognostic factors. Earlier, such factors were thought to be similar to those seen in ovarian cancer. The incidence of PFTC has been rising during the last decades, especially in higher social classes and among women in certain occupations. Parity is a strong protective factor for PFTC, with a lower incidence associated with an increasing number of deliveries. Previous sterilisation seems to offer some protection. Earlier suggestions of previous genital infections as risk factors appear not to hold. Previous cancers are frequent among PFTC patients, especially breast cancer. Second primary cancers after PFTC are also frequent, especially non-lymphoid leukemia, colorectal, breast, bladder and lung cancer. Only 4% of primary fallopian carcinomas are correctly diagnosed before operation. Treatment consists of aggressive cytoreductive surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy with a platinum-taxane combination.

This mutation appeared specific for Spanish Gypsies as it is not found in other Gypsy patients with FA from Hungary, Germany, Slovakia, and Ireland. Haplotype analysis showed that Spanish Gypsy patients all share the same haplotype. Our data thus suggest that the high incidence of FA among Spanish Gypsies is due to an ancestral founder mutation in FANCA that originated in Spain less than 600 years ago.

Prenatal screening is done in Austria and France, but the effect of treatment during pregnancy is not well documented. The aim of our study was to find out the maternofetal transmission rate and outcome in infants born to mothers who were not treated during pregnancy.<h4>Methods</h4>We analysed 89873 eluates from phenylketonuria (PKU) cards from neonates and paired first-trimester serum samples from the mothers for specific IgG antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii. Children born to mothers who seroconverted during pregnancy were followed-up clinically and serologically to 12 months of age. In addition, 21144 PKU cards were analysed for toxoplasma-specific IgM antibodies during the last 12 months of the study.<h4>Findings</h4>In 24989 (27.8%) cases both the PKU eluate and the first-trimester samples were IgG positive, which indicates previous maternal infection. 139 of the 64884 seronegative women acquired toxoplasma infection during pregnancy and gave birth to 141 infants (two sets of twins). 27 of these children were diagnosed with congenital toxoplasma infection. The transmission rate was 19.4% (95% CI 13.2-27.0). Clinical signs and symptoms were found in four (15%) of the 27 children. The additional analysis for toxoplasma-specific IgM antibodies from the PKU card identified seven of nine children with congenital toxoplasma infection. The false-positive rate for the IgM test was 0.19 per 1000, and no false-negatives were found.<h4>Interpretation</h4>The risks of transmission of infection and of disease in the infant are low in an area with a low risk of toxoplasma infection.

UV81KO skin fibroblasts in culture was 5-fold more sensitive to 254 nm UV killing than normal cells, though the response of obligatory heterozygotes was normal.

From 1992, sampling was systematically performed at the third day of life.<h4>Results</h4>Thirty-three cases were detected and confirmed (20 boys and 13 girls). Diagnosis was made before recalling on a clinical basis in three boys and eight girls. In 22 cases (17 boys and five girls) when diagnosis was not made before recalling, it could have been suspected in three girls because of a sex ambiguity once associated with dehydration and in eight boys because of failure to thrive (six times) or a marked dehydration (twice). Lack of sex ambiguity in two girls characterized non classical form of the illness. These two patients benefited from the early detection of the illness on growth data. Out of 49 subjects who died before recall, three could be suspected of bearing 21-hydroxylase deficiency. One single false negative case was found, which led to decrease cut-off value. On the other hand, false positive cases were frequent (0.37%), mainly in premature newborns (88% of cases).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Although decrease of median age for recall at 7 days did not prevent the occurrence of two cases of dehydration, neonatal screening of 21-hydroxylase deficiency appears to be efficient, as far as diagnostic strategy is considered.",['GARD:0005757'],"{'21-hydroxylase deficiency', 'congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency'}",{'l'},{'occurrence'},['0 . 37 %']

To adjust cut-off levels for 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) in relation to gestational age and birth weight, comparing the benefits in terms of reduction of recall rates with the two approaches and ultimately choosing the better of the two.<h4>Subjects and methods</h4>Since September 2001, blood samples from neonates born in North-Eastern Italy have been screened with a fluoroimmunoassay method for 17-OHP determination (DELFIA). A preliminary cut-off level of > or = 30 nmol/l was set both for term and preterm newborns. The values of 17-OHP were analysed using statistical methods in relation to gestational age and birth weight in order to modify the cut-off on the basis of our data.<h4>Results</h4>After 33 months of screening we screened 128,282 newborns and detected 6 affected babies. During the first 8 months of screening among the recalled babies, 89.6 and 78.1% were preterm and low-birth-weight newborns, respectively, with a recall rate of 2.59% for premature neonates and of 4.94% for babies with birth weights < 2,500 g. We chose a new cut-off value of 50 nmol/l for preterm newborns only and, after 4 months, the recall rate was reduced to 0.83% for these infants and to 1.83% for low-birth-weight infants.<h4>Conclusion</h4>After 33 months of screening for CAH in North-Eastern Italy, we report an incidence of 1:21,380. In 5 out of 6 affected babies, the diagnosis was established only after a positive screening test, which prevented a severe salt-wasting crisis in these babies. The cut-off level related to gestational age led to a significant reduction in the number of false-positives among preterm babies.We therefore intend to continue with the screening program for CAH in North-Eastern Italy, keeping a gestational-age-related cut-off in the hope that our data may encourage a national screening program for CAH.",['GARD:0001467'],{'congenital adrenal hyperplasia'},"{'##aly', 'north - eastern it', 'north - eastern italy'}",{'incidence'},['0 . 83 %']

INTRODUCTION:Many published studies have estimated the association of rs2435357 and rs1800858 polymorphisms in the proto-oncogene rearranged during transfection (RET) gene with Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) risk. However, the results remain inconsistent and controversial. AIM:To perform a meta-analysis get a more accurate estimation of the association of rs2435357 and rs1800858 polymorphisms in the RET proto-oncogene with HSCR risk. METHODS:The eligible literatures were searched by PubMed, Google Scholar, EMBASE, and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) up to June 30, 2018. Summary odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to evaluate the susceptibility to HSCR. RESULTS:A total of 20 studies, including ten (1,136 cases 2,420 controls) for rs2435357 and ten (917 cases 1,159 controls) for rs1800858 were included. The overall results indicated that the rs2435357 (allele model: OR=0.230, 95% CI 0.178-0.298, p=0.001; homozygote model: OR=0.079, 95% CI 0.048-0.130, p=0.001; heterozygote model: OR=0.149, 95% CI 0.048-0.130, p=0.001; dominant model: OR=0.132, 95% CI 0.098-0.179, p=0.001; and recessive model: OR=0.239, 95% CI 0.161-0.353, p=0.001) and rs1800858 (allele model: OR=5.594, 95% CI 3.653-8.877, p=0.001; homozygote model: OR=8.453, 95% CI 3.783-18.890, p=0.001; dominant model: OR=3.469, 95% CI 1.881-6.396, p=0.001; and recessive model: OR=6.120, 95% CI 3.608-10.381, p=0.001) polymorphisms were associated with the increased risk of HSCR in overall.

In the other 10 French families, no interlineage was discovered in a genealogical enquiry pursued back to the 18th century. Further studies are needed to find out whether there was only one mutation responsible for all French cases or whether several mutations occurred in France, as suggested by the present study.

Only patients fulfilling the American College of Rheumatology 1990 criteria for WG were included in the study, and demographic and clinical data at diagnosis were recorded. Incidence, point prevalence, and period prevalence rates were estimated for three 5-year periods.<h4>Results</h4>Fifty-five patients (62% male) with a median age at diagnosis of 50 years (range 10-84 years) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The annual incidence/ million population increased from 5.2 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 2.7-9.0) during 1984-1988 to 12.0 (95% CI 8.0-17.3) during 1994-1998. The point prevalence/million increased from 30.4 (95% CI 16.6-51.0) to 95.1 (95% CI 69.1-129.0). The highest incidence rate occurred in men ages 65-74 years. There were no significant period differences in age, first organ involved, delay of diagnosis, or disease activity, but fewer patients had malaise and renal insufficiency during the earliest time period. No seasonal variation in the onset of WG was present, although we noted a pattern of annual fluctuation.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The prevalence of WG has tripled in northern Norway over the last 15 years. While more efficacious therapy may explain part of this increase, we also found a significant trend toward increased incidence over that period.

We used data from a general practice database to provide information on the current incidence of IPF and sarcoidosis in the UK.<h4>Methods</h4>Data were extracted for all patients with a diagnosis of IPF or sarcoidosis between 1991 and 2003. The whole population of the database was used to calculate disease incidence stratified by age, sex, region, and time period. Poisson regression was used to compare the incidence between populations and Cox regression was used to compare survival between populations.<h4>Results</h4>920 cases of IPF (mean age 71 years, 62% male) and 1019 cases of sarcoidosis (mean age 47 years, 47% male) were identified. The overall incidence rate per 100 000 person-years was 4.6 for IPF and 5.0 for sarcoidosis. The incidence of IPF increased progressively between 1991 and 2003 (p<0.00001), and was highest in Northern England and Scotland (p<0.0001). The survival of patients with IPF was stable over time. In contrast, the incidence of sarcoidosis was highest in London, West Midlands and Northern Ireland and remained stable over time.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The incidence of IPF has more than doubled between 1990 and 2003; this is not due to the ageing of the UK population or an increased ascertainment of milder cases.

The epidemiology of immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is not well-characterised in the general population. This study described the incidence and survival of ITP using the UK population-based General Practice Research Database (GPRD). ITP patients first diagnosed in 1990-2005 were identified in the GPRD. Overall incidence rates (per 100,000 person-years) and rates by age, sex, and calendar periods were calculated. Survival analysis was conducted using the Kaplan-Meier and proportional hazard methods. A total of 1145 incident ITP patients were identified. The crude incidence was 3.9 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.7-4.1). Overall average incidence was statistically significantly higher in women (4.4, 95% CI: 4.1-4.7) compared to men (3.4; 95% CI: 3.1-3.7). Among men, incidence was bimodal with peaks among ages under 18 and between 75-84 years. The hazard ratio for death among ITP patients was 1.6 (95% CI: 1.3-1.9) compared to age- and sex-matched comparisons. During follow-up 139 cases died, of whom 75 had a computerised plausible cause of death. Death was related to bleeding in 13% and infection in 19% of these 75. In conclusion, ITP incidence varies with age and is higher in women than men.

Data from 21 institutes were returned.<h4>Results</h4>Data were collected for 358 children (219 boys and 139 girls) who were diagnosed and treated for WS. The incidences of WS were 112 cases in 1997, 104 cases in 1998, 108 cases in 1999, and 34 cases in the first half of 2000. Based on these figures, the presumed annual incidence of WS in Korea was derived to be one in 4000 live births, although there was a great inter-district variability. Regarding the etiology, 138 cases (38.5%) were cryptogenic. For the 220 symptomatic cases, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) was the most common etiologic factor (50.8%), followed by central nervous system anomaly including malformation of cortical development (21.4%), and neurocutaneous syndrome (8.6%). Clinically flexor type spasms were most common (59.2%) and 199 cases (55.6%) revealed typical hypsarrhythmia, electroencephalographically. During 1997 and 1998, vigabatrin (VGB) was used most frequently for the treatment of WS, followed by valproic acid and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). In 1999 and 2000, the use of ACTH diminished and topiramate was used more frequently than ACTH. Spasms were controlled in 230 cases (64.2%) and evolution to other seizure types was observed in 44 cases (11.2%). Developmental and/or mental retardation were noticed in 270 cases (75.4%).<h4>Conclusions</h4>The yearly incidence of WS did not show significant change in Korea between 1997 and 2000. Among symptomatic WS, HIE was the most common cause. During the period of this study, VGB was the most popular therapeutic regimen possibly because of shortage of ACTH.

Recent advances in diagnostic and therapeutic techniques may have changed incidence and etiologies of West syndrome (WS). We performed a retrospective epidemiological study of WS that occurred in 47 children in Nagasaki Prefecture during a recent 10-year period from 1989 to 1998. The incidence of WS was 3.1/10,000 live births. Thirty-nine patients (83%) had symptomatic WS, in which the prenatal causes were most frequent, followed by low-birth weight (LBW) infants, perinatal and postnatal. Such high frequency of LBW may have been due to a relative increase in survivors of premature babies because of recent advances in perinatal care. The brain computerized tomography/magnetic resonance imaging performed in 41 patients revealed congenital brain malformation (10 patients), destructive brain disorders (13 patients), and no structural abnormalities (18 patients). The seizure outcome was worse in the symptomatic WS than in the cryptogenic WS. The developmental outcome was very poor in both symptomatic and cryptogenic WS. The mean developmental quotient (DQ) in all patients was 25, and only four patients (11%) had a normal DQ (>70). DQ was lower in patients with developmental delay before the onset of WS, symptomatic group, relapse and/or persistence of seizure. Developmental delay seen in WS patients seems to be related to the two major factors, that is, underlying brain abnormalities and the persistent seizures as a result of the former. Therefore, every effort should be made to control seizures, including medical and early surgical treatment, as well as prevention of brain damage through perinatal care.",['GARD:0007887'],{'West syndrome'},"{'japan', 'nagasaki prefecture'}",{'incidence'},"['3 . 1 / 10 , 000 live births']"

The apparent prevalence of dermatitis herpetiformis was 11 per 100 000 in our population; approximately one fifth of that of coeliac disease. Jejunal villous atrophy was present in 78% of our dermatitis herpetiformis patients, and a single jejunal biopsy was as effective at detecting this as the multiple biopsy technique. A majority of patients were able to stop, or radically reduce their dapsone or sulphapyridine treatment after the institution of a gluten free diet. Spontaneous remission of the skin lesion occurred in only two patients not receiving a gluten free diet. Gastric parietal or thyroid antibodies were detected in 38% of patients, and three cases of thyroid disease and two cases of pernicious anaemia were detected. Lymphoma developed in two patients, one being intestinal in origin.

TAZ mutations were observed in 15 pedigrees. The estimated incidence of BTHS was 1.5 cases per million births (95%CI: 0.2-2.3). The median age at presentation was 3.1 weeks (range, 0-1.4 years), and the median age at last follow-up was 4.75 years (range, 3-15 years). Eleven patients died at a median age of 5.1 months; 9 deaths were related to cardiomyopathy and 2 to sepsis. The 5-year survival rate was 51%, and no deaths were observed in patients ≥3 years. Fourteen patients presented with cardiomyopathy, and cardiomyopathy was documented in 20 during follow-up. Left ventricular systolic function was very poor during the first year of life and tended to normalize over time. Nineteen patients had neutropenia. Metabolic investigations revealed inconstant moderate 3-methylglutaconic aciduria and plasma arginine levels that were reduced or in the low-normal range. Survival correlated with two prognostic factors: severe neutropenia at diagnosis (<0.5 × 109/L) and birth year. Specifically, the survival rate was 70% for patients born after 2000 and 20% for those born before 2000.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This survey found that BTHS outcome was affected by cardiac events and by a risk of infection that was related to neutropenia.

We employed exome sequencing to identify the underlying molecular defects in patients with unresolved but putatively autosomal-recessive disorders in consanguineous families and postulated that the pathogenic variants would reside within homozygous regions. Fifty consanguineous families participated in the study, with a wide spectrum of clinical phenotypes suggestive of autosomal-recessive inheritance, but with no definitive molecular diagnosis.

Here, we describe a patient with a mild form of congenital disorder of glycosylation type II (CDG-II) that is caused by a deficiency in the Cog1 subunit of the complex. This patient has a defect in both N- and O-glycosylation. Mass spectrometric analysis of the structures of the N-linked glycans released from glycoproteins from the patient's serum revealed a reduction in sialic acid and galactose residues. Peanut agglutinin (PNA) lectin staining revealed a decrease in sialic acids on core 1 mucin type O-glycans, indicating a combined defect in N- and O-glycosylation. Sequence analysis of the COG1 cDNA and gene identified a homozygous insertion of a single nucleotide (2659-2660insC), which is predicted to lead to a premature translation stop and truncation of the C terminus of the Cog1 protein by 80 amino acids. This mutation destabilizes several other COG subunits and alters their subcellular localization and hence the overall integrity of the COG complex. This results in reduced levels and/or altered Golgi localization of alpha-mannosidase II and beta-1,4 galactosyltransferase I, which links it to the glycosylation deficiency.

A recent pilot study suggested that management of patients with suspected viral encephalitis was often suboptimal.<h4>Aim</h4>To examine the relative incidence, clinical features and management of suspected acute CNS infections in adults across the NHS North West Region.<h4>Design</h4>A multicentre cross-sectional retrospective cohort study at 10 hospitals across the region over 3 months (from September to December 2007). Following a screen of all patients who had cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis or received intravenous aciclovir and/or third-generation cephalosporin, those with clinical features suspicious of a CNS infection were included. Management was compared with the national meningitis and regional encephalitis guidelines.<h4>Results</h4>Three hundred and eighty-five patients were screened; 217 patients had a suspected CNS infection and 44 (20%) had a CNS infection: 18 aseptic meningitis (one herpes simplex virus [HSV]-2), 13 purulent meningitis (four Streptococcus pneumoniae) and 13 encephalitis (three HSV-1).

Serum free-carnitine levels were determined in 973 unrelated white collar workers in Akita, Japan. Fourteen of these participants consistently had serum free-carnitine levels below the fifth percentile (28 microM for females and 38 microM for males). The OCTN2 (organic cation transporter) gene was sequenced for these 14 subjects, for 22 subjects whose carnitine levels were below the fifth percentile in the first screening but were normal in the second measurement and in 69 individuals with normal carnitine levels for two separate measurements. Polymorphic sequences defined three major haplotypes with equal frequency. Mutations were identified in nine subjects with low carnitine levels: Trp132X (three individuals), Ser467Cys (four), Trp283Cys (one) and Met179Leu (one). In vitro expression studies in HEK cells indicated that Ser467Cys and Trp283Cys, but not Met179Leu, significantly reduced L-carnitine uptake relative to the normal control. Trp132X and Ser467Cys were associated with specific haplotypes, suggesting a founder effect. A conservative estimate of the overall prevalence of heterozygotes was 1.01% in the Akita prefecture, Japan, giving an estimated incidence of primary systemic carnitine deficiency (MIM 212140) as 1 in 40 000 births. An echocardiographic study of the families of patients with primary carnitine deficiency revealed that the heterozygotes for OCTN2 mutations were predisposed to late onset benign cardiac hypertrophy (odds ratio 15.1, 95% CI 1.39-164) compared with the wild-types.

In addition, the effect of a splice site mutation was determined using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR).<h4>Results</h4>A total of 3 novel mutations in the HMGCL gene were revealed by molecular analysis: one missense mutation (c.494G>T, p.Arg165Gln) and 2 splice site mutations (IVS3+1G>A, IVS6-1G>A). The results of RT-PCR revealed that an IVS3+1G>A mutation leads to skipping of exon3. We also calculated that the incidence of HL deficiency in Taiwan is <1 per 1,000,000 live births.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The results of this study suggest that unique HMGCL gene mutations exist in Taiwanese HL deficiency patients.

We screened for increased osmotic fragility of erythrocytes in 1464 healthy German blood donors. The osmotic fragility was determined by an acidified glycerol lysis test (AGLT) using glycerol-sodium phosphate-buffered NaCl solution. Since the original test described by Zanella et al. [23] showed only low specificity for hereditary spherocytosis, we used a modification with 0.0093 M sodium phosphate-buffered glycerol-saline solution, pH 6.90, instead of the original 0.0053 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.85. Sixteen of the donors (1.1%) had a ""pathologic result,"" similar to that of 32 patients with hereditary spherocytosis: AGLT 50 less than 5 min (""half-time of AGLT, defining normal and pathologic results). The osmotic fragility of the erythrocytes from 12 of these donors was further investigated using the conventional test with hypotonic NaCl solutions. With one exception, increased osmotic fragility was verified in all of them by both tests. Further hematologic data showed a mild reticulocytosis (2% and 2.6%) in two of the donors. One donor had a moderate reticulocytosis of 6.5%, probably due to a mild, previously undiagnosed spherocytosis; 99 of the donors had an intermediate result (AGLT 50: 5-30 min). Hypotonic lysis of their erythrocytes by the conventional method showed a normal result; there were no signs of increased hemolysis. Thus they are not definitely regarded as having increased osmotic fragility of their erythrocytes. Erythrocyte osmotic fragility shows a wide distribution range in the normal population and might be normally distributed. Thus the blood donors with ""pathologic AGLT (less than 5 min)"" probably represent only one end of a continuum of salt-dependent hemolysis, and not a separate entity. However, they did show additional minor signs of a functional defect of the erythrocyte membrane and therefore could be carriers of a spherocytosis trait. The frequency of carriers of an erythrocyte membrane defect (possible spherocytosis trait) could be as high as 1.1% in the general population and would distinctly exceed the prevalence of patients with apparent spherocytosis (0.02%).",['GARD:0006639'],{'hereditary spherocytosis'},{'Worldwide'},{'prevalence'},['0 . 02 %']

To address the issue, xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) in Japan is an interesting candidate because of three major reasons: XP is an autosomal recessive disorder with an enormously elevated risk of skin cancer, the frequency of XP patients is higher in Japan than in other parts of the world, and more than half of Japanese XP patients are homozygous for the same founder mutation in the XPA gene. We screened archival blood samples from Japanese individuals who resided in Hiroshima or Nagasaki. A simple PCR-RFLP method was developed that is highly specific for detection of XPA heterozygotes carrying the founder mutation. We identified nine XPA heterozygotes among 1,020 individuals screened for a prevalence of 0.88%.

An additional 20 patients with hereditary nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia caused by PK deficiency have been genotyped. One previously unreported mutation 1153C-->T (R385W) was encountered. The relative frequency of PK mutations in patients with hemolytic anemia caused by PK deficiency was calculated from the 18 white patients reported here and from 102 patients previously reported in the literature. DNA samples from 3785 subjects from different ethnic groups have been screened for the 4 more frequently encountered mutations-c.1456 C-->T(1456T), c.1468 C-->T(1468T), c.1484 C-->T(1484T), and c.1529 G6A (1529A)-by allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization.

Previous studies have identified mutations in the actin-capping protein KANK1 and the adaptor protein-4 complex in forms of inherited cerebral palsy, suggesting a role for components of the dynamic cytoskeleton in the genesis of the disease.<h4>Methods</h4>We studied a multiplex consanguineous Jordanian family by homozygosity mapping and exome sequencing, then used patient-derived fibroblasts to examine functional consequences of the mutation we identified in vitro. We subsequently studied the effects of adducin loss of function in Drosophila.<h4>Results</h4>We identified a homozygous c.1100G>A (p.G367D) mutation in ADD3, encoding gamma adducin in all affected members of the index family. Follow-up experiments in patient fibroblasts found that the p.G367D mutation, which occurs within the putative oligomerization critical region, impairs the ability of gamma adducin to associate with the alpha subunit. This mutation impairs the normal actin-capping function of adducin, leading to both abnormal proliferation and migration in cultured patient fibroblasts. Loss of function studies of the Drosophila adducin ortholog hts confirmed a critical role for adducin in locomotion.<h4>Interpretation</h4>Although likely a rare cause of cerebral palsy, our findings indicate a critical role for adducins in regulating the activity of the actin cytoskeleton, suggesting that impaired adducin function may lead to neuromotor impairment and further implicating abnormalities of the dynamic cytoskeleton as a pathogenic mechanism contributing to cerebral palsy.",[],set(),{'Worldwide'},{'occurs'},['1 in 500']

Both subjects had normal intelligence and productive lives despite failure to experience pain due to broken bones, severe cold or burns. Functional assessments revealed that both are generally hypesthetic with thresholds greater than two standard deviations above normal for a several of modalities in addition to noxious stimuli. Sweating was 3 to 8-fold greater than normal. Sural nerve biopsy showed that all types of myelinated and unmyelinated fibers were severely reduced. Extensive multi-antibody immunofluorescence analyses were conducted on several skin biopsies from the hands and back of one CAPH subject and two normal subjects.

Description of large cohorts and case reports has refined the specific phenotypes associated with these PIDs helping to the diagnosis. Specific pathways required for protective immunity to EBV have emerged from studies of these PIDs. SLAM-associated protein-dependent SLAM receptors and MAGT1-dependent NKG2D pathways are important for T and NK-cell cytotoxicity toward EBV-infected B-cells, while CD27-CD70 interactions are critical to drive the expansion of EBV-specific T-cells. CTPS1 and RASGRP1 deficiencies further strengthen that T-lymphocyte expansion is a key step in the immune response to EBV. These pathways appear to be also important for the anti-tumoral immune surveillance of abnormal B cells.

An autozygosity mapping strategy using high-density single nucleotide polymorphism microarrays and microsatellite markers was used to detect regions of genome homozygosity that might contain the disease gene. Candidate genes were then screened for mutations by direct sequencing.<h4>Results</h4>Both affected subjects had poor vision from birth and complained of progressive visual loss over time. Current visual acuity ranged from 6/60 to 6/120. Fundus examination revealed bilateral temporal optic nerve pallor in both patients with otherwise normal retinal findings. International-standard full-field electroretinograms were normal in both individuals, with no evidence of generalized retinal dysfunction. Pattern cortical visual evoked potentials were grossly abnormal bilaterally in both cases. The pattern electroretinogram N95:P50 ratio was subnormal, and the P50 was of shortened peak time bilaterally in both patients. The electrophysiological findings were consistent with bilateral retinal ganglion cell/optic nerve dysfunction.

Thirty-three novel AVPR2 mutations were identified in 62 families that were not included in our previous studies. This study describes the diversity of mutations observed in a total of 117 families, the number of affected people at the time of diagnosis, skewed X chromosome inactivation in severely affected females, the inferred parental origin of de novo mutations, and it provides estimates of incidence. Among 117 families, there were 82 different putative disease-causing mutations. Based on haplotype analysis, it can be inferred that when the same AVPR2 mutation is identified in different families that were not known to be related, the mutations most likely arose independently. More than half of the families had only one affected male; two families presented with a severely affected female and no family history of NDI. A de novo mutation arose during oogenesis in the mother in 20% of isolated cases.

Patients were entered into a registry and recruited into an epidemiologic study entailing interview and buccal scrapings to determine HLA-DQB1 *0602 status. Missing values were imputed to allow prevalence to be estimated based on all 425 patients entered into the registry between 2001 and 2005, whether they were recruited into the epidemiologic study (n=279) or not (n=146).<h4>Results</h4>As of July 01, 2001, estimated prevalence per 100,000 of physician-diagnosed narcolepsy with cataplexy was 21.8 (95% confidence interval (CI): 18.8-24.8), similar to prior studies. The median age of onset was 14 (interquartile range: 10-18). For narcolepsy with HLA-DQB1 *0602, prevalence was 15.3 (95% CI: 12.8-17.9). Estimated prevalence was higher in women than men and in African-Americans than other racial groups.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These differences could reflect problems in identification and recruitment or may provide etiologic clues about narcolepsy.

Biochemically this results in underhydroxylation of collagen lysyl residues and, hence, an abnormal pattern of lysyl pyridinoline (LP) and hydroxylysyl pyridinoline (HP) crosslinks excreted in the urine. Clinically the disorder is characterized by hypotonia and kyphoscoliosis at birth, joint hypermobility, and skin hyperelasticity and fragility. Severe hypotonia usually leads to delay in gross motor development, whereas cognitive development is reported to be normal.<h4>Methods</h4>We describe the clinical, biochemical and molecular characterisation, as well as electron microscopy findings of skin, in 15 patients newly diagnosed with this rare type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.<h4>Results</h4>Age at diagnosis ranged from 5 months to 27 years, with only 1/3 of the patients been diagnosed correctly in the first year of life. A similar disease frequency was found in females and males, however a broad disease severity spectrum (intra- and interfamilial), independent of molecular background or biochemical phenotype, was observed. Kyphoscoliosis, one of the main clinical features was not present at birth in 4 patients. Importantly we also noted the occurrence of vascular rupture antenatally and postnatally, as well as developmental delay in 5 patients.<h4>Conclusion</h4>In view of these findings we propose that EDS VIA is a highly variable clinical entity, presenting with a broad clinical spectrum, which may also be associated with cognitive delay and an increased risk for vascular events. Genotype/phenotype association studies and additional molecular investigations in more extended EDS VIA populations will be necessary to further elucidate the cause of the variability of the disease severity.",['GARD:0002083'],{'EDS VIA'},{'Worldwide'},{'occurrence'},['1 / 3']

Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) is a gamma-herpes virus that infects 90% of humans without any symptoms in most cases, but has an oncogenic potential, especially in immunocompromised individuals. In the past 30 years, several primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) associated with a high risk to develop EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disorders (LPDs), essentially consisting of virus-associated hemophagocytic syndrome, non-malignant and malignant B-cell LPDs including non-Hodgkin and Hodgkin's types of B lymphomas have been characterized. Among them are SH2D1A (SAP), XIAP, ITK, MAGT1, CD27, CD70, CTPS1, RASGRP1, and CORO1A deficiencies. Penetrance of EBV infection ranges from 50 to 100% in those PIDs. Description of large cohorts and case reports has refined the specific phenotypes associated with these PIDs helping to the diagnosis. Specific pathways required for protective immunity to EBV have emerged from studies of these PIDs. SLAM-associated protein-dependent SLAM receptors and MAGT1-dependent NKG2D pathways are important for T and NK-cell cytotoxicity toward EBV-infected B-cells, while CD27-CD70 interactions are critical to drive the expansion of EBV-specific T-cells. CTPS1 and RASGRP1 deficiencies further strengthen that T-lymphocyte expansion is a key step in the immune response to EBV. These pathways appear to be also important for the anti-tumoral immune surveillance of abnormal B cells.

Clubfoot is a common birth defect characterized by inward posturing and rigid downward displacement of one or both feet. The etiology of syndromic forms of clubfoot is varied and the causes of isolated clubfoot are not well understood. A microduplication of 2.2 Mb on chromosome 17q23.1q23.2 which includes T-box 4 (TBX4), a hindlimb-specific gene, and 16 other genes was recently identified in 3 of 66 families reported as nonsyndromic clubfoot, but additional non-foot malformations place them in the syndromic clubfoot category. Our study assesses whether variation in or around TBX4 contributes to nonsyndromic clubfoot. To determine whether this microduplication was a common cause of nonsyndromic clubfoot, 605 probands (from 148 multiplex and 457 simplex families) with nonsyndromic clubfoot were evaluated by copy number and oligonucleotide array CGH testing modalities. Only one multiplex family (0.68%) that had 16 with clubfoot and 9 with other foot anomalies, had a 350 kb microduplication, which included the complete duplication of TBX4 and NACA2 and partial duplication of BRIP1. The microduplication was transmitted in an autosomal dominant pattern and all with the microduplication had a range of phenotypes from short wide feet and toes to bilateral clubfoot. Minimal evidence was found for an association between TBX4 and clubfoot and no pathogenic sequence variants were identified in the two known TBX4 hindlimb enhancer elements. Altogether, these results demonstrate that variation in and around the TBX4 gene and the 17q23.1q23.2 microduplication are not a frequent cause of this common orthopedic birth defect and narrows the 17q23.1q23.2 nonsyndromic clubfoot-associated region.",[],set(),{'Worldwide'},set(),['0 . 68 %']

We identified seven other TYK2-deficient patients from five families and four different ethnic groups. These patients were homozygous for one of five null mutations, different from that seen in P1. They displayed mycobacterial and/or viral infections, but no HIES. All eight TYK2-deficient patients displayed impaired but not abolished cellular responses to (a) IL-12 and IFN-α/β, accounting for mycobacterial and viral infections, respectively; (b) IL-23, with normal proportions of circulating IL-17(+) T cells, accounting for their apparent lack of mucocutaneous candidiasis; and (c) IL-10, with no overt clinical consequences, including a lack of inflammatory bowel disease. Cellular responses to IL-21, IL-27, IFN-γ, IL-28/29 (IFN-λ), and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) were normal. The leukocytes and fibroblasts of all seven newly identified TYK2-deficient patients, unlike those of P1, responded normally to IL-6, possibly accounting for the lack of HIES in these patients. The expression of exogenous wild-type TYK2 or the silencing of endogenous TYK2 did not rescue IL-6 hyporesponsiveness, suggesting that this phenotype was not a consequence of the TYK2 genotype. The core clinical phenotype of TYK2 deficiency is mycobacterial and/or viral infections, caused by impaired responses to IL-12 and IFN-α/β.

Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC) is a group of disorders characterized by congenital joint contractures caused by reduced fetal movements. AMC has an incidence of 1 in 3000 newborns and is genetically heterogeneous. We describe an autosomal recessive form of myogenic AMC in a large consanguineous family. The disease is characterized by bilateral clubfoot, decreased fetal movements, delay in motor milestones, then progressive motor decline after the first decade. Genome-wide linkage analysis revealed a single locus on chromosome 6q25 with Z(max) = 3.55 at theta = 0.0 and homozygosity of the polymorphic markers at this locus in patients. Homozygous A to G nucleotide substitution of the conserved AG splice acceptor site at the junction of intron 136 and exon 137 of the SYNE-1 gene was found in patients. This mutation results in an aberrant retention of intron 136 of SYNE-1 RNA leading to premature stop codons and the lack of the C-terminal transmembrane domain KASH of nesprin-1, the SYNE-1 gene product. Mice lacking the KASH domain of nesprin-1 display a myopathic phenotype similar to that observed in patients. Altogether, these data strongly suggest that the splice site mutation of SYNE-1 gene found in the family is responsible for AMC. Recent reports have shown that mutations of the SYNE-1 gene might be responsible for autosomal recessive adult onset cerebellar ataxia.

Whole-exome sequencing was performed using 62-Mb exome enrichment, followed by variant prioritization using bioinformatic prediction tools, variant validation by Sanger sequencing, and segregation of the variant with the disease phenotype in the family.<h4>Results</h4>Presumptive causal variants were identified in 28 patients (53%; 95% CI, 39%-67%) and possible causal variants were identified in 4 (8%; 95% CI, 2%-18%). Together these accounted for 32 patients (60% 95% CI, 46%-74%) and involved 18 different genes. These included recurrent mutations in RMND1, AARS2, and MTO1, each on a haplotype background consistent with a shared founder allele, and potential novel mutations in 4 possible mitochondrial disease genes (VARS2, GARS, FLAD1, and PTCD1). Distinguishing clinical features included deafness and renal involvement associated with RMND1 and cardiomyopathy with AARS2 and MTO1. However, atypical clinical features were present in some patients, including normal liver function and Leigh syndrome (subacute necrotizing encephalomyelopathy) seen in association with TRMU mutations and no cardiomyopathy with founder SCO2 mutations. It was not possible to confidently identify the underlying genetic basis in 21 patients (40%; 95% CI, 26%-54%).<h4>Conclusions and relevance</h4>Exome sequencing enhances the ability to identify potential nuclear gene mutations in patients with biochemically defined defects affecting multiple mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes.

Identification of the molecular basis of patients with syndromic autism extends our understanding of the pathogenesis of autism in general. The objective of this study was to find the gene mutated in eight patients from a large kindred, who suffered from autism spectrum disorder, arthrogryposis and epilepsy.<h4>Methods and results</h4>By linkage analysis and exome sequencing, we identified deleterious mutations in SLC35A3 in these patients. SLC35A3 encodes the major Golgi uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) transporter. In Golgi vesicles isolated from patient fibroblasts the transport of the respective nucleotide sugar was significantly reduced causing a massive decrease in the content of cell surface expressed highly branched N-glycans and a concomitant sharp increase of lower branched glycoforms.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Spontaneous mutation in SLC35A3 has been discovered in cattle worldwide, recapitulating the human phenotype with arthrogryposis and additional skeletal defects known as Complex Vertebral Malformation syndrome. The skeletal anomalies in the mutant cattle and in our patients, and perhaps even the neurological symptoms are likely the consequence of the lack of high-branched N-glycans and the concomitant abundance of lower-branched glycoforms at the cell surface. This pattern has previously been associated with growth arrest and induction of differentiation. With this study, we add SLC35A3 to the gene list of autism spectrum disorders, and underscore the crucial importance of UDP-GlcNAc in the regulation of the N-glycan branching pathway in the Golgi apparatus.",['GARD:0000777'],{'arthrogryposis'},{'worldwide'},set(),['55 %']

Recently, mutations in the mitochondrial tRNA processing gene, ELAC2, were reported to be associated with the recessively inherited form of hypertrophic CMP (HCM). This study is aimed at describing the cardiac phenotype and outcome of ELAC2 mutation.<h4>Methods</h4>We performed whole exome sequencing followed by targeted mutation screening to identify the genetic etiology of severe infantile-onset CMP in 64 consanguineous Saudi families.<h4>Results</h4>A previously reported mutation (p.Phe154Leu) in ELAC2 gene was detected in 16 families.

The aim of this study is to examine the incidence and the demographical trend of this condition over a ten-year period.<h4>Methods</h4>Data of patients with anencephaly born from 1993 to 2002 were retrieved from the National Birth Defect Registry and analysed.<h4>Results</h4>There were a total of 267 cases of anencephaly in the ten-year period from 1993 to 2002, giving an overall incidence of 0.58 per 1,000 livebirths, with a decreasing trend noted. The incidence was highest among the Malay population, compared with the Chinese population (p-value equals 0.03) and other races. Abortion rates have also increased over the years, causing a reduction in livebirth rates for this condition.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The overall incidence and birth incidence of anencephaly has seen a decreasing trend over the last ten years, with the latter being contributed significantly by early termination.

So far, 50 patients with AUTS2 syndrome have been described, but clinical data are limited and almost all cases involved young children.<h4>Methods</h4>We present a detailed clinical description of 13 patients (including six adults) with AUTS2 syndrome who have a pathogenic mutation or deletion in AUTS2. All patients were systematically evaluated by the same clinical geneticist.<h4>Results</h4>All patients have borderline to severe ID/developmental delay, 83-100% have microcephaly and feeding difficulties. Congenital malformations are rare, but mild heart defects, contractures and genital malformations do occur. There are no major health issues in the adults; the oldest of whom is now 59 years of age. Behaviour is marked by it is a friendly outgoing social interaction. Specific features of autism (like obsessive behaviour) are seen frequently (83%), but classical autism was not diagnosed in any. A mild clinical phenotype is associated with a small in-frame 5' deletions, which are often inherited. Deletions and other mutations causing haploinsufficiency of the full-length AUTS2 transcript give a more severe phenotype and occur de novo.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The 13 patients with AUTS2 syndrome with unique pathogenic deletions scattered around the AUTS2 locus confirm a phenotype-genotype correlation.

The molecular basis for primary hereditary hypertriglyceridemia has been identified in fewer than 5% of cases. Investigation of monogenic dyslipidemias has the potential to expose key metabolic pathways. We describe a hitherto unreported disease in ten individuals manifesting as moderate to severe transient childhood hypertriglyceridemia and fatty liver followed by hepatic fibrosis and the identification of the mutated gene responsible for this condition. We performed SNP array-based homozygosity mapping and found a single large continuous segment of homozygosity on chromosomal region 12q13.12. The candidate region contained 35 genes that are listed in Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) and 27 other genes. We performed candidate gene sequencing and screened both clinically affected individuals (children and adults with hypertriglyceridemia) and also a healthy cohort for mutations in GPD1, which encodes glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 1. Mutation analysis revealed a homozygous splicing mutation, c.361-1G>C, which resulted in an aberrantly spliced mRNA in the ten affected individuals. This mutation is predicted to result in a truncated protein lacking essential conserved residues, including a functional site responsible for initial substrate recognition. Functional consequences of the mutation were evaluated by measuring intracellular concentrations of cholesterol and triglyceride as well as triglyceride secretion in HepG2 (hepatocellular carcinoma) human cells lines overexpressing normal and mutant GPD1 cDNA. Overexpression of mutant GPD1 in HepG2 cells, in comparison to overexpression of wild-type GPD1, resulted in increased secretion of triglycerides (p = 0.01).

We previously mapped the gene that causes autosomal-dominant CODA in a large pedigree to a chromosome 12q locus. Using comparative genomic hybridization and quantitative PCR analysis of this pedigree, we report identifying a 6-Kbp heterozygous triplication upstream of the matrix metalloproteinase 19 (MMP19) gene, present in all 17 affected family members and no normal members. Moreover, the triplication was not detected in 78 control subjects or in the Database of Genomic Variants. We further detected the same 6-Kbp triplication in one of 24 unrelated CODA patients and in none of 172 glaucoma patients. Analysis with a Luciferase assay showed that the 6-Kbp sequence has transcription enhancer activity. A 773-bp fragment of the 6-Kbp DNA segment increased downstream gene expression eightfold, suggesting that triplication of this sequence may lead to dysregulation of the downstream gene, MMP19, in CODA patients. Lastly, immunohistochemical analysis of human donor eyes revealed strong expression of MMP19 in optic nerve head.

Gastric neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) arise from enterochromaffin-like cells, which are located in oxyntic glands within the stomach. Type I tumours represent 70-80% of gastric NETs and are associated with hypergastrinaemia, chronic atrophic gastritis and achlorhydria. Gastrin is involved in the endocrine regulation of gastric acid production. Most type I gastric NETs are sporadic, have a good prognosis and their genetic basis are unknown. We performed an exome sequencing study in a family with consanguineous parents and 10 children, five of whom were affected by type I gastric NET. Atypical clinical traits included an earlier age of onset (around 30 years), aggressiveness (three had nodal infiltration requiring total gastrectomy and one an adenocarcinoma) and iron-deficiency rather than megaloblastic anaemia. We identified a homozygous missense mutation in the 14th exon of the ATP4A gene (c.2107C>T), which encodes the proton pump responsible for acid secretion by gastric parietal cells. The amino acid p.Arg703Cys is highly conserved across species and originates a change of one of the transmembrane domains that avoids the liberation of protons from cells to stomach. This is consistent with the achlorhydria that was observed in the affected individuals. No germline or somatic mutations in the ATP4A gene were found in sporadic gastric NET patients. Based on the results of this large family, it seems that this atypical form of gastric NET has an earlier age of onset, behaves more aggressively and has atypical clinical traits that differentiated from other studied cases.",[],set(),{'Worldwide'},set(),['70']

Hereditary cerebellar ataxias (CAs) are neurodegenerative disorders clinically characterized by a cerebellar syndrome, often accompanied by other neurological or non-neurological signs. All transmission modes have been described. In autosomal-dominant CA (ADCA), mutations in more than 30 genes are implicated, but the molecular diagnosis remains unknown in about 40% of cases. Implication of ion channels has long been an ongoing topic in the genetics of CA, and mutations in several channel genes have been recently connected to ADCA. In a large family affected by ADCA and mild pyramidal signs, we searched for the causative variant by combining linkage analysis and whole-exome sequencing. In CACNA1G, we identified a c.5144G>A mutation, causing an arginine-to-histidine (p.Arg1715His) change in the voltage sensor S4 segment of the T-type channel protein Cav3.1. Two out of 479 index subjects screened subsequently harbored the same mutation. We performed electrophysiological experiments in HEK293T cells to compare the properties of the p.Arg1715His and wild-type Cav3.1 channels. The current-voltage and the steady-state activation curves of the p.Arg1715His channel were shifted positively, whereas the inactivation curve had a higher slope factor. Computer modeling in deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) neurons suggested that the mutation results in decreased neuronal excitability. Taken together, these data establish CACNA1G, which is highly expressed in the cerebellum, as a gene whose mutations can cause ADCA. This is consistent with the neuropathological examination, which showed severe Purkinje cell loss.

Intellectual disability (ID) affects approximately 1%-3% of humans with a gender bias toward males. Previous studies have identified mutations in more than 100 genes on the X chromosome in males with ID, but there is less evidence for de novo mutations on the X chromosome causing ID in females. In this study we present 35 unique deleterious de novo mutations in DDX3X identified by whole exome sequencing in 38 females with ID and various other features including hypotonia, movement disorders, behavior problems, corpus callosum hypoplasia, and epilepsy. Based on our findings, mutations in DDX3X are one of the more common causes of ID, accounting for 1%-3% of unexplained ID in females. Although no de novo DDX3X mutations were identified in males, we present three families with segregating missense mutations in DDX3X, suggestive of an X-linked recessive inheritance pattern. In these families, all males with the DDX3X variant had ID, whereas carrier females were unaffected. To explore the pathogenic mechanisms accounting for the differences in disease transmission and phenotype between affected females and affected males with DDX3X missense variants, we used canonical Wnt defects in zebrafish as a surrogate measure of DDX3X function in vivo. We demonstrate a consistent loss-of-function effect of all tested de novo mutations on the Wnt pathway, and we further show a differential effect by gender. The differential activity possibly reflects a dose-dependent effect of DDX3X expression in the context of functional mosaic females versus one-copy males, which reflects the complex biological nature of DDX3X mutations.",[],set(),{'Worldwide'},set(),['1']

Here we report six unrelated individuals with a common phenotype consisting of NDD with severe speech delay, hypotonia, and facial dysmorphism. These patients underwent WES with a trio approach and de novo heterozygous predicted pathogenic novel variants in the KAT6A gene were identified.

We used data from a general practice database to provide information on the current incidence of IPF and sarcoidosis in the UK.<h4>Methods</h4>Data were extracted for all patients with a diagnosis of IPF or sarcoidosis between 1991 and 2003. The whole population of the database was used to calculate disease incidence stratified by age, sex, region, and time period. Poisson regression was used to compare the incidence between populations and Cox regression was used to compare survival between populations.<h4>Results</h4>920 cases of IPF (mean age 71 years, 62% male) and 1019 cases of sarcoidosis (mean age 47 years, 47% male) were identified. The overall incidence rate per 100 000 person-years was 4.6 for IPF and 5.0 for sarcoidosis. The incidence of IPF increased progressively between 1991 and 2003 (p<0.00001), and was highest in Northern England and Scotland (p<0.0001). The survival of patients with IPF was stable over time. In contrast, the incidence of sarcoidosis was highest in London, West Midlands and Northern Ireland and remained stable over time.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The incidence of IPF has more than doubled between 1990 and 2003; this is not due to the ageing of the UK population or an increased ascertainment of milder cases.

The endocytic network is essential for neural development and synaptic plasticity by regulating the sorting of numerous transmembrane proteins. Disruption of the pathway can lead to neuronal pathology. Endosomal biogenesis relies on two Rab proteins, Rab5 and Rab7, which bind to two hexameric tethering complexes, the endosomal class C core vacuole/endosome tethering complex (CORVET) and the late endosomal/lysosomal homotypic fusion and protein sorting complex (HOPS). Both complexes consist of four core proteins and differ by their specific Rab-binding proteins.<h4>Objectives</h4>To identify the molecular basis of a neurological disease, which consists of global developmental stagnation at 3-8 months, increasing appendicular spasticity, truncal hypotonia and acquired microcephaly, with variable seizure disorder, accompanied by thin corpus callosum, paucity of white matter and delayed myelination in eight patients from four unrelated Ashkenazi-Jewish (AJ) families.<h4>Methods</h4>Exome analysis, homozygosity mapping and Mup1-GFP transport assay in mutant yeast.<h4>Results</h4>Homozygosity for a missense mutation, p.Cys846Gly, in one of the endosomal biogenesis core proteins, VPS11, was identified in all the patients. This was shown to be a founder mutation with a carrier frequency of 0.6% in the AJ population. The homologous yeast mutant had moderate impairment of fusion of the late endosome to the vacuole in Mup1-GFP transport assay.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We speculate that in neuronal cells, impairment of fusion of the late endosome to the vacuole would attenuate the degradation of plasma membrane receptors, thereby underlying the progressive neuronal phenotype in our patients.

There are 3 major sweat-producing glands present in skin; eccrine, apocrine, and apoeccrine glands. Due to the high rate of secretion, eccrine sweating is a vital regulator of body temperature in response to thermal stress in humans; therefore, an inability to sweat (anhidrosis) results in heat intolerance that may cause impaired consciousness and death. Here, we have reported 5 members of a consanguineous family with generalized, isolated anhidrosis, but morphologically normal eccrine sweat glands. Whole-genome analysis identified the presence of a homozygous missense mutation in ITPR2, which encodes the type 2 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (InsP3R2), that was present in all affected family members. We determined that the mutation is localized within the pore forming region of InsP3R2 and abrogates Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum, which suggests that intracellular Ca2+ release by InsP3R2 in clear cells of the sweat glands is important for eccrine sweat production. Itpr2-/- mice exhibited a marked reduction in sweat secretion, and evaluation of sweat glands from Itpr2-/- animals revealed a decrease in Ca2+ response compared with controls. Together, our data indicate that loss of InsP3R2-mediated Ca2+ release causes isolated anhidrosis in humans and suggest that specific InsP3R inhibitors have the potential to reduce sweat production in hyperhidrosis.",[],set(),{'Worldwide'},set(),"[', 4']"

A candidate locus for this syndrome was mapped to chromosomal region 2p14 by microcell-mediated chromosome transfer in two unrelated families. Unexpectedly, analysis of genes in this area identified mutations in two different genes, both of which are involved in [Fe-S] cluster biogenesis. A homozygous missense mutation, c.545G>A, near the splice donor of exon 6 in NFU1 predicting a p.Arg182Gln substitution was found in one of the families. The mutation results in abnormal mRNA splicing of exon 6, and no mature protein could be detected in fibroblast mitochondria. A single base-pair duplication c.123dupA was identified in BOLA3 in the second family, causing a frame shift that produces a premature stop codon (p.Glu42Argfs(∗)13). Transduction of fibroblast lines with retroviral vectors expressing the mitochondrial, but not the cytosolic isoform of NFU1 and with isoform 1, but not isoform 2 of BOLA3 restored both respiratory chain function and oxoacid dehydrogenase complexes. NFU1 was previously proposed to be an alternative scaffold to ISCU for the biogenesis of [Fe-S] centers in mitochondria, and the function of BOLA3 was previously unknown.

SETD5 lies within the critical interval for 3p25 microdeletion syndrome. The individuals with SETD5 mutations showed phenotypic similarity to those previously reported with a deletion in 3p25, and thus loss of SETD5 might be sufficient to account for many of the clinical features observed in this condition.

In humans, there are three Trm10 orthologs, one mitochondrial and two presumed cytoplasmic. A nonsense mutation in one of the cytoplasmic orthologs (TRMT10A) has recently been associated with microcephaly, intellectual disability, short stature and adolescent onset diabetes.<h4>Methods and results</h4>The subjects were three patients who suffered from microcephaly, intellectual disability, short stature, delayed puberty, seizures and disturbed glucose metabolism, mainly hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia. A homozygous Gly206Arg (G206R) mutation in the TRMT10A gene was identified using whole exome sequencing. The mutation segregated in the family and was absent from large control cohorts. Determination of the methylation activity of the expressed wild-type (WT) and variant TRMT10A enzymes with transcripts of (32)P -tRNA(Gly) GCC as a substrate revealed a striking defect (<0.1% of WT activity) for the variant enzyme. The binding affinity of the G206R variant enzyme to tRNA, determined by fluorescence anisotropy, was similar to that of the WT enzyme.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The completely abolished m(1)G9 methyltransferase activity of the mutant enzyme is likely due to significant defects in its ability to bind the methyl donor S-adenosyl methionine. We propose that TRMT10A deficiency accounts for abnormalities in glucose homeostasis initially manifesting both ketotic and non-ketotic hypoglycaemic events with transition to diabetes in adolescence, perhaps as a consequence of accelerated β cell apoptosis.

Particularly challenging are those disorders rare enough to have eluded recognition as a discrete clinical entity, those with highly variable clinical manifestations, and those that are difficult to distinguish from other, very similar, disorders. Here we demonstrate the power of using an unbiased genotype-driven approach to identify subsets of patients with similar disorders. By studying 1,133 children with severe, undiagnosed developmental disorders, and their parents, using a combination of exome sequencing and array-based detection of chromosomal rearrangements, we discovered 12 novel genes associated with developmental disorders.

Leukodystrophies are a heterogeneous group of disorders associated with abnormal central nervous system white matter. The clinical features invariably include upper motor neuron signs and developmental regression with or without other neurological manifestations. The objective of this study was to characterize clinically and genetically a new form of childhood-onset leukodystrophy with ataxia and tremor. We recruited seven French-Canadian cases belonging to five families affected by an unknown form of childhood-onset leukodystrophy. Genome-wide scans (GWS) were performed using the Illumina Hap310 or Hap610 Bead Chip to identify regions of shared homozygosity that were further studied for linkage with STS markers. All cases presented between the ages of 1 and 5 years with spasticity along with other upper motor neuron signs, prominent postural tremor, and cerebellar signs. Though motor regression is a constant feature, cognitive functions are relatively preserved, even late in the course of the disease. The higher frequency of founder diseases in the French-Canadian population and the segregation in pedigrees are suggestive of a recessive mode of inheritance. By homozygosity mapping, we established linkage to a 12.6-Mb SNP-haplotyped region on chromosome 10q22.3-10q23.31 (maximum LOD score: 5.47).

Multiple respiratory chain complex defects are particularly difficult to diagnose at the molecular level because of the massive number of nuclear genes potentially involved in intramitochondrial protein synthesis, with many not yet linked to human disease.<h4>Objective</h4>To determine the molecular basis of multiple respiratory chain complex deficiencies.<h4>Design, setting, and participants</h4>We studied 53 patients referred to 2 national centers in the United Kingdom and Germany between 2005 and 2012. All had biochemical evidence of multiple respiratory chain complex defects but no primary pathogenic mitochondrial DNA mutation. Whole-exome sequencing was performed using 62-Mb exome enrichment, followed by variant prioritization using bioinformatic prediction tools, variant validation by Sanger sequencing, and segregation of the variant with the disease phenotype in the family.<h4>Results</h4>Presumptive causal variants were identified in 28 patients (53%; 95% CI, 39%-67%) and possible causal variants were identified in 4 (8%; 95% CI, 2%-18%). Together these accounted for 32 patients (60% 95% CI, 46%-74%) and involved 18 different genes. These included recurrent mutations in RMND1, AARS2, and MTO1, each on a haplotype background consistent with a shared founder allele, and potential novel mutations in 4 possible mitochondrial disease genes (VARS2, GARS, FLAD1, and PTCD1).

In the past 30 years, several primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) associated with a high risk to develop EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disorders (LPDs), essentially consisting of virus-associated hemophagocytic syndrome, non-malignant and malignant B-cell LPDs including non-Hodgkin and Hodgkin's types of B lymphomas have been characterized. Among them are SH2D1A (SAP), XIAP, ITK, MAGT1, CD27, CD70, CTPS1, RASGRP1, and CORO1A deficiencies. Penetrance of EBV infection ranges from 50 to 100% in those PIDs. Description of large cohorts and case reports has refined the specific phenotypes associated with these PIDs helping to the diagnosis. Specific pathways required for protective immunity to EBV have emerged from studies of these PIDs. SLAM-associated protein-dependent SLAM receptors and MAGT1-dependent NKG2D pathways are important for T and NK-cell cytotoxicity toward EBV-infected B-cells, while CD27-CD70 interactions are critical to drive the expansion of EBV-specific T-cells. CTPS1 and RASGRP1 deficiencies further strengthen that T-lymphocyte expansion is a key step in the immune response to EBV. These pathways appear to be also important for the anti-tumoral immune surveillance of abnormal B cells.

Several treatments have been developed over the last 20 years, yet the preferred method to treat ECAA remains unknown. This paper is a review of all available literature on the risk of complications and long-term outcome after conservative or invasive treatment of patients with ECAA.<h4>Methods</h4>Reports on ECAA treatment until July 2014 were searched in PubMed and Embase using the key words aneurysm, carotid, extracranial, and therapy.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 281 articles were identified. Selected articles were case reports (n = 179) or case series (n = 102). Papers with fewer than 10 patients were excluded, resulting in the final selection of 39 articles covering a total of 1,239 patients. Treatment consisted of either conservative treatment in 11% of the cases or invasive treatment in 89% of the cases. Invasive treatment comprised surgery in 94%, endovascular approach in 5%, and a hybrid approach in 1% of the patients. The most common complication described after invasive therapy was cranial nerve damage, which occurred in 11.8% of patients after surgery. The 30 day mortality rate and stroke rate in conservatively treated patients was 4.67% and 6.67%, after surgery 1.91% and 5.16%. Information on confounders in the present study was incomplete. Therefore, adjustments to correct for confounding by indication could not be done.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This review summarizes the largest available series in the literature on ECAA management. The number of ECAAs reported in current literature is scarce. The early and long-term outcome of invasive treatment in ECAA is favorable; however, cranial nerve damage after surgery occurs frequently. Unfortunately, due to limitations in reporting of results and confounding by indication in the available literature, it was not possible to determine the optimal treatment strategy.

Tungiasis (sand flea disease) is caused by the penetration of females of Tunga penetrans into the skin of the feet. Within 2 weeks of penetration the burrowed flea increases its volume by a factor of 2,000. This is paralleled by intense inflammation of the surrounding tissue. Acute and chronic inflammation leads to the development of painful and debilitating clinical pathology. This results in impaired physical fitness and mobility. The social implications of tungiasis-associated morbidity are multifold. Children with tungiasis are teased and ridiculed, adults feel ashamed and stigmatized. There is anecdotal evidence that tungiasis negatively affects educational achievements. Impaired mobility and physical fitness will have a negative impact on household economics. Sand flea disease is common in resource-poor communities in South America and in sub-Saharan Africa with prevalence in the general population of up to 60%. In East Africa, it has re-emerged in epidemic dimensions in recent years. Hitherto, no effective drug treatment has been at hand.

A 28-year-old man whose estrogen resistance was caused by a disruptive mutation in the estrogen-receptor gene underwent studies of pituitary-gonadal function and bone density and received transdermal estrogen for six months. Estrogen-receptor DNA, extracted from lymphocytes, was evaluated by analysis of single-strand-conformation polymorphisms and by direct sequencing.<h4>Results</h4>The patient was tall (204 cm [80.3 in.]) and had incomplete epiphyseal closure, with a history of continued linear growth into adulthood despite otherwise normal pubertal development. He was normally masculinized and had bilateral axillary acanthosis nigricans. Serum estradiol and estrone concentrations were elevated, and serum testosterone concentrations were normal. Serum follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone concentrations were increased. Glucose tolerance was impaired, and hyperinsulinemia was present. The bone mineral density of the lumbar spine was 0.745 g per square centimeter, 3.1 SD below the mean for age-matched normal women; there was biochemical evidence of increased bone turnover. The patient had no detectable response to estrogen administration, despite a 10-fold increase in the serum free estradiol concentration. Conformation analysis of his estrogen-receptor gene revealed a variant banding pattern in exon 2. Direct sequencing of exon 2 revealed a cytosine-to-thymine transition at codon 157 of both alleles, resulting in a premature stop codon. The patient's parents were heterozygous carriers of this mutation, and pedigree analysis revealed consanguinity.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Disruption of the estrogen receptor in humans need not be lethal.

Based on a detailed clinical and laboratory investigation of 89 patients with histologically verified desmoid tumor and the pertinent medical literature, we have reviewed the etiologic factors, clinical characteristics, and results of treatment of this rare disorder. The incidence of the tumor in the Finnish population is low, 2.4 to 4.3 new cases per 10(6) inhabitants per year. The age distribution profile demonstrated four distinct peak periods: the juvenile period, the fertile period, the middle-age period and the old-age period. The juvenile desmoid tumor is an extraabdominal tumor found in young girls, the fertile variety is an abdominal tumor found in women, the middle age variety is also overwhelmingly abdominal but the sex ratio approaches equality, whereas in the old age group, both abdominal and extraabdominal tumors are equally frequent and the sex ratio is equal. In all male patients, the growth rate was low. A low growth rate was also recorded in young girls. A growth rate of twice that speed was seen in fertile women and four times that speed in the middle age group. In the old age group, a low growth rate, equal to that of male patients, was a rule. The fertile female patients with desmoid tumor had a significant predisposition to estrogen dominance and deviation from progesterone dominance. The direct relationship of the growth rate to the level of endogenous estrogen in the female patients and the demonstration of significant amounts of estradiol but not progesterone receptors in the tumor cytosol further suggest that the growth rate of desmoid tumor is regulated by steroid sex hormones. A significant number of patients with an abdominal desmoid tumor had a history of surgical trauma in the region of subsequent tumor growth. A very high number of the patients demonstrated multiple minor malformations of the bony skeleton. An increased frequency of these malformations was also recorded in the families of the patients and the distribution of the malformations among the family members was compatible with an autosomally dominant pattern of inheritance. After operation, the frequency of recurrence was not statistically different, regardless of whether the tumor was completely removed or not. A combination of operation and radiotherapy did not reduce the frequency of recurrences; in fact, it doubled it.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",['GARD:0001820'],{'desmoid tumor'},{'Worldwide'},{'incidence'},['2 . 4 to 4 . 3 new cases per 10 ( 6 ) inhabitants per year']

PVOD and idiopathic PAH share a similar clinical presentation, genetic background and hemodynamic profile. A definite diagnosis of PVOD necessitates a surgical biopsy, but since it represents a high-risk procedure in these patients, it is contraindicated. Therefore, a noninvasive diagnostic approach using chest high-resolution computed tomography, arterial blood gas analysis, pulmonary function tests and bronchoalveolar lavage is helpful to detect PVOD.

We hereby present three affected individuals: two children and a fetus from two unrelated East Jerusalem Arab-Muslim families. Whereas most fetuses die in utero or perinatally, one of the children survived to 15 months.

In mice, Sobp (also known as Jxc1) is critical for patterning of the organ of Corti; one of our patients has a subclinical cochlear hearing loss but no gross cochlear abnormalities. In situ RNA expression studies in postnatal mouse brain showed strong expression in the limbic system at the time interval of active synaptogenesis. The limbic system regulates learning, memory, and affective behavior, but limbic circuitry expression of other genes mutated in ID is unusual.

Dihydropyrimidinase (DHP) deficiency is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the DPYS gene. Patients present with highly elevated levels of dihydrouracil and dihydrothymine in their urine, blood and cerebrospinal fluid. The analysis of the effect of mutations in DPYS on pre-mRNA splicing is hampered by the fact that DHP is primarily expressed in liver and kidney cells. The minigene approach can detect mRNA splicing aberrations using cells that do not express the endogenous mRNA. We have used a minigene-based approach to analyze the effects of a presumptive pre-mRNA splicing mutation in two newly identified Chinese pediatric patients with DHP deficiency. Mutation analysis of DPYS showed that both patients were compound heterozygous for a novel intronic mutation c.1443+5G>A in intron 8 and a previously described missense mutation c.1001A>G (p.Q334R) in exon 6. Wild-type and the mutated minigene constructs, containing exons 7, 8 and 9 of DPYS, yielded different splicing products after expression in HEK293 cells. The c.1443+5G>A mutation resulted in altered pre-mRNA splicing of the DPYS minigene construct with full skipping of exon 8. Analysis of the DHP crystal structure showed that the deletion of exon 8 severely affects folding, stability and homooligomerization of the enzyme as well as disruption of the catalytic site. Thus, the analysis suggests that the c.1443+5G>A mutation results in aberrant splicing of the pre-mRNA encoding DHP, underlying the DHP deficiency in two unrelated Chinese patients.",[],set(),{'he'},set(),['7']

Endothelial and anterior corneal dystrophies accounted for most of the reported dystrophies, and granular corneal dystrophy was the least common, being reported in 167 enrollees. Age, sex, and race variations among the various corneal dystrophies were observed. The mean age of those with macular corneal dystrophy (47.3 years) was 15 years younger than the age of those with endothelial dystrophy (62.9 years), and females were most highly represented (68.5%) among those with lattice corneal dystrophy. Hispanics and blacks were underrepresented relative to enrollees undergoing eye care for reasons other than corneal dystrophy.

The purpose of this study was to identify families with CFEOM in this geographical region in order to perform a study of the clinical presentation of this disorder and to estimate its minimum prevalence in the population.<h4>Methods</h4>Four families were identified with CFEOM in the Wessex region from whom a full history with a pedigree was obtained. All individuals underwent ophthalmological examination.<h4>Results/conclusion</h4>This study shows that several of the CFEOM entities can be present within one family suggesting that these are variants of the same condition. It is suggested that subclassification is, therefore, not appropriate. The minimum prevalence of this disorder was found to be 1/230,000.",[],set(),{'Worldwide'},{'prevalence'},['1 / 230']

Incidence per 100 000 person-years and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated, and PCNSL-specific survival was estimated using relative survival. Tests for temporal trends were performed using Poisson regression. Population incidence of all brain tumors was retrieved for comparison.<h4>Results</h4>With 359 identified PCNSL cases (median age 66 years), overall incidence was 0.26 (95% CI: 0.24-0.29) and the average annual increase 4% (P = .002). The increasing trend was primarily observed among elderly individuals (70+ years). Similarly, an increase in incidence of all brain tumors was noted only among the elderly. There was no significant improvement in relative survival across the study period although, among fit patients (with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, EGOC 0), survival plateaued 6 years after diagnosis.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The increasing PCNSL incidence in the elderly was consistent with an increasing incidence of brain tumors of any type and may in part be attributable to improved diagnostics and reporting in this group. New treatment options have not yet translated into general survival improvements in a population-based setting, although the presence of long-term survivors among fit patients is encouraging.",['GARD:0009318'],"{'primary central nervous system lymphoma', 'Primary central nervous system lymphoma', 'PCNSL'}",{'sweden'},"{'incidence', 'overall incidence'}",['incidence per 100 000 person']

All residents have high access to health care and an accredited referral center for SSc. Seeking care outside of this region is difficult because of the peculiar geography. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence and spatial variation of systemic sclerosis (SSc) in eastern France.<h4>Methods</h4>Data for SSc patients were obtained from 3 sources (all general practitioners and community specialists, capillaroscopy centers, and all public and private hospital records) and were used to estimate the prevalence of SSc. Surviving patients who resided in Alsace on January 1, 2008 and fulfilled the American College of Rheumatology and/or the LeRoy and Medsger criteria were included in this study. The clinical characteristics of the patients were also assessed. Potentially incomplete case ascertainment was corrected by capture-recapture analyses. Geographic disparities were assessed by spatial cluster analysis and by comparing our results with those for other geographic areas in the world for which data derived using similar methodology were available.<h4>Results</h4>The review of 499 potential cases identified a total of 244 SSc patients. A trend toward a west-to-east gradient was observed but did not reach statistical significance. According to log-linear modeling, an estimated 83.87 additional cases were missed. Thus, the SSc prevalence was 228.42 cases per million adult inhabitants of Alsace (95% confidence interval 203.70-253.14); this prevalence was significantly higher than that in 2 other regions of France and comparable with the reported prevalence in Detroit, Michigan.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The stringent methodology used in the current study is very likely to provide an accurate estimation of the prevalence of SSc.

Patients (n=1088) were identified in the Swedish National Patient Register.<h4>Results</h4>The incidence of CLE was 4·0/100,000; the female/male ratio was 3:1. Mean age at disease onset was 54 years. The most common subset was discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) (80%, n = 868). A quarter of the patients (24%, n=260) were already diagnosed with SLE at the time they were diagnosed with CLE. During the whole observation period (2005-2007), an additional 18% (n = 107) were diagnosed with SLE, the probability of receiving an additional SLE diagnosis being highest for the subacute CLE (SCLE) subset.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This is the first nationwide epidemiological study on CLE. We found the incidence of CLE to be about equal to that of SLE, and found a higher short-term probability for receiving an additional diagnosis with SLE than previously described for CLE. Subsets other than DLE and SCLE were rarely reported in our system; an update of the ICD codes for this diagnostic group could increase reporting of these more unusual cases.

Although mutations in more than 90 genes are known to cause CMT, the underlying genetic cause of CMT remains unknown in more than 50% of affected individuals. The discovery of additional genes that harbor CMT2-causing mutations increasingly depends on sharing sequence data on a global level. In this way-by combining data from seven countries on four continents-we were able to define mutations in ATP1A1, which encodes the alpha1 subunit of the Na<sup>+</sup>,K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, as a cause of autosomal-dominant CMT2. Seven missense changes were identified that segregated within individual pedigrees: c.143T>G (p.Leu48Arg), c.1775T>C (p.Ile592Thr), c.1789G>A (p.Ala597Thr), c.1801_1802delinsTT (p.Asp601Phe), c.1798C>G (p.Pro600Ala), c.1798C>A (p.Pro600Thr), and c.2432A>C (p.Asp811Ala). Immunostaining peripheral nerve axons localized ATP1A1 to the axolemma of myelinated sensory and motor axons and to Schmidt-Lanterman incisures of myelin sheaths. Two-electrode voltage clamp measurements on Xenopus oocytes demonstrated significant reduction in Na<sup>+</sup> current activity in some, but not all, ouabain-insensitive ATP1A1 mutants, suggesting a loss-of-function defect of the Na<sup>+</sup>,K<sup>+</sup> pump. Five mutants fall into a remarkably narrow motif within the helical linker region that couples the nucleotide-binding and phosphorylation domains.

Infants with elevated levels of 17-hydroxyprogesterone were referred for evaluation, and those considered to have CAH were studied with respect to disease characteristics. Data were collected by pediatric endocrinologists using standardized forms that included type of CAH, results of laboratory tests, treatment regimen, disease symptoms and signs, and, for girls, degree of genital virilization.<h4>Results</h4>The incidence of classic CAH in Texas is 1:16 008, with a ratio of salt-wasting to simple-virilizing of 2.7:1. A majority of infants detected were undiagnosed until screened, despite signs of salt-wasting or ambiguous genitalia. It was difficult to differentiate salt-wasting from simple-virilizing CAH in infants who were identified before the onset of adrenal insufficiency or electrolyte abnormalities. A substantial number of infants with nonclassic (NC) CAH also were detected. Not all infants were detected on the initial screen; 14% of infants with classic CAH and 87% with NC CAH were detected on the second routine screening test.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our findings confirm the benefits of newborn screening for CAH and the importance of a second screening test, and suggest that programs for newborn CAH screening must consider complex issues in diagnosis and treatment. These results also confirm that CAH is a continuum of disorders, rather than a disorder with discrete subtypes. In addition, the difficulties in differentiating CAH subtypes in newborns, and thus deciding appropriate treatment, and the high incidence of NC CAH suggest that standard diagnostic criteria and treatment regimens for CAH may need modification.

Clinically NFPA is currently the preferred term for designing all the pituitary adenomas which are not hormonally active (in other words, not associated with clinical syndromes such as amenorrhea-galactorrhea in the context of prolactinomas, acromegaly, Cushing's disease or hyperthyroidism secondary to TSH-secreting adenomas). They account for 15-30% of pituitary adenomas. Diagnosis is usually made either in the context of mass effect due to a macroadenoma or, increasingly, fortuitously during imaging performed for some unrelated purpose; the latter case is known as pituitary incidentaloma. Surgery is indisputably indicated in case of tumoral syndrome, but other aspects of NFPA (hormonal work-up, follow-up, and especially postoperative follow-up, management of remnant or recurrence, the special case of incidentaloma, or apoplexy) remain controversial. The French Endocrinology Society (SFE) therefore set up an expert working group of endocrinologists, neurosurgeons, ophthalmologists, neuroradiologists, pathologists and biologists to draw up guidelines, at the 2012 SFE Congress in Toulouse, France.

Variability in the phenotype and the presence of several potential mouse models suggest that HPS may be a heterogeneous disorder. In order to identify a gene responsible for HPS, we collected blood samples from a relatively homogeneous population in Puerto Rico where the HPS carrier frequency is estimated to be 1 in 21. Analysis of pooled DNA samples allowed us to rapidly screen the genome for candidate loci, and significant evidence for linkage was detected for a marker on chromosome 10q. This region of the human genome is conserved syntenically with the region on mouse chromosome 19 where two possible mouse models for HPS, pale ear and ruby eye, are located. This linkage result was verified with additional markers, and a maximum LOD score of 5.07 at theta = .001 was calculated for marker D10S198.

Biotinidase deficiency is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder included in many newborn screening programmes. Prior to the introduction of screening for biotinidase deficiency in Sweden in 2002, the disorder was almost unknown, with only one case diagnosed clinically. Biotinidase activity was measured in dried blood spots with a semiquantitative method using biotin-6-amidoquinoline as substrate. The cutoff value was set at 25% (later lowered to 20%) of the mean activity of all samples measured on that day. The disorder was confirmed by quantitative determination of biotinidase activity in plasma and DNA analyses. Over a period of 6 years, 13 patients were identified among 637,452 screened newborns and 5,068 adoptive/immigrant children. None of the patients had clinical symptoms at the time of diagnosis. Six patients had profound biotinidase deficiency, with an activity of 0-5% of normal in plasma. Four of these patients were born to parents who were first cousins of Middle Eastern or African origin. Eighteen gene alterations were identified, nine of which have not previously been described: seven mutations p.L83S (c.248T > C), p.R148H (c.443G > A), p.N202I (c.605A > T), p.I255T (c.764T > C), p.N402S (c.1205A > G), p.L405P (c.1214T > C), p.G445R (c.1333G > A) and two silent mutations p.L71L (c.211C > T) and p.L215L (c.645C > T).

Insulinomas, the most common cause of hypoglycemia related to endogenous hyperinsulinism, occur in 1-4 people per million of the general population. Common autonomic symptoms of insulinoma include diaphroresis, tremor, and palpitations, whereas neuroglycopenenic symptoms include confusion, behavioural changes, personality changes, visual disturbances, seizure, and coma. Diagnosis of suspected cases is based on standard endocrine tests, especially the prolonged fasting test. Non-invasive imaging procedures, such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, are used when a diagnosis of insulinoma has been made to localize the source of pathological insulin secretion. Invasive modalities, such as endoscopic ultrasonography and arterial stimulation venous sampling, are highly accurate in the preoperative localization of insulinomas and have frequently been shown to be superior to non-invasive localization techniques. The range of techniques available for the localization of insulinomas means that blind resection can be avoided. Intraoperative manual palpation of the pancreas by an experienced surgeon and intraoperative ultrasonography are both sensitive methods with which to finalize the location of insulinomas.

The other 38 infants had various urinary tract abnormalities--most commonly, isolated hydronephrosis and multicystic dysplasia of the kidney. Six of the 38 children had more than one renal abnormality detected prenatally. Reflux was noted in association with prenatally detected urinary tract abnormalities in 4 of 32 newborns (12%) who underwent voiding cystourethrography. In fetuses with normal amniotic fluid volume, the perinatal outcome was good. Children with lower urinary tract obstruction had evidence of more severe renal dysfunction than did those with involvement at more proximal levels. The presence or absence of urinary tract obstruction postnatally could not be determined reliably on the basis of prenatal ultrasound appearance.<h4>Conclusion</h4>In this study, more than half of all prenatally detected urinary tract abnormalities were isolated hydronephrosis or multicystic dysplasia of the kidney.

Precise genotype-phenotype correlations are problematic because of the difficulties in determining the extent of euchromatic loss, the level of mosaicism, and the influence of the timing of ascertainment. We report two discordant examples of r(15) patients. In the first case, prenatal diagnosis of a de novo r(15) was made during the second trimester: mos 46,XX,r(15)(p11.2q26)[32]/45,XX,-15[13]/47,XX,r(15)(p11.2q26)x2[3]/46,XX,dic r(15)(p11.2q26p11.2q26[1]/46,XX[2].

Both cases showed loss of the 15q subtelomeric region by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). To investigate the discordance in phenotypes between the two patients, we undertook array comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) analyses to more fully characterize the deletions associated with these otherwise structurally indistinguishable r(15) chromosomes from conventional cytogenetic analyses and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies. By array CGH, patient 1 showed deletion of multiple contiguous clones predicting an approximately 6 Mb deletion of distal 15q. In contrast, patient 2 showed loss of just the 15q subtelomeric clone and an interstitial clone by array CGH confirming that the severity of the phenotype correlated with the size of the deletion at the molecular level.

Trends were examined by Generalized Estimation Equations for Poisson regression.<h4>Results</h4>From 1985 to 2006, the birth incidence of newborn penile anomalies increased in California from 47 to 57 cases per 10,000 newborn discharges, yet the trend for hypospadias alone appears stable from 1997. The rates for penile anomalies in newborns increased 1.4% annually (p < 0.001). All racial/ethnic groups analyzed showed this increase (p < 0.001 for each). During the study period there was a 2% increase per year in plural births (p < 0.001). Interestingly, the rate of change in penile anomaly incidence was greater in males of plural births compared to their singleton cohorts (2% vs 1% annually) (p < 0.001). The birth incidence of cleft palate, another congenital anomaly known to be stable over time, remained unchanged over this period.<h4>Conclusions</h4>From 1985 to 2006 in California the incidence of penile anomalies increased in a statistically significant manner, but the incidence of hypospadias appears stable for the last decade.

Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia and macular degeneration causing progressive blindness. It accounts for 1 to 11.6 % of spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) cases worldwide and for 7.4 % of SCA7 cases in Mexico. We identified a cluster of SCA7 families who resided in a circumscribed area of Veracruz and investigated whether the high incidence of the disease in this region was due to a founder effect. A total of 181 individuals from 20 families were studied. Four microsatellite markers and one SNP flanking the ATNX7 gene were genotyped and the ancestral origin and local ancestry analysis of the SCA7 mutation were evaluated. Ninety individuals from 19 families had the SCA7 mutation; all were found to share a common haplotype, suggesting that the mutation in these families originated from a common ancestor. Ancestral origin and local ancestry analysis of SCA7 showed that the chromosomal segment containing the mutation was of European origin. We here present evidence strongly suggesting that the high frequency of SCA7 in Veracruz is due to a founder effect and that the mutation is most likely of European origin with greatest resemblance to the Finnish population.",['GARD:0004955'],"{'spinocerebellar ataxia type 7', 'Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7'}","{'veracruz', 'mexico', 'worldwide'}",{'incidence'},['1']

Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia (FHH) is a rare, lifelong, benign condition. It is important to separate this condition from other hypercalcaemic states such as hypercalcaemia of malignancy and primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT).<h4>Recent findings</h4>FHH is caused by inactivating mutations in the calcium sensing receptor (CASR) gene leading to a general calcium-hyposensitivity, compensatory hypercalcaemia and hypocalciuria. The inheritance of FHH is autosomal dominant. Similar to PHPT, FHH is characterized by hypercalcaemia, unsuppressed or elevated plasma parathyroid hormone, and typically normal renal function. The phenotype is normal, and hypercalcaemic symptoms are generally absent. The hallmark is a relatively low urine calcium excretion in contrast to PHPT, in which urine calcium excretion is increased. The vitamin D status as measured by plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D has been reported to be normal with normal seasonal variations, whereas plasma 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D has been found slightly increased compared to normal. Bone mineral density Z-scores are normal in spite of a slightly increased bone turnover. Differential diagnoses include mainly PHPT, but in some cases also hypercalcaemia of malignancy and use of thiazide diuretics.<h4>Summary</h4>In general, FHH does not require treatment. We recommend a two-step diagnostic procedure. First, the calcium/creatinine clearance ratio is measured from a 24-h urine. Second, all patients with calcium/creatinine clearance ratio of 0.020 or less are tested for mutations in the CASR gene.

The objective of this investigation was to describe the epidemiology of anotia and microtia with respect to various factors. The cases studied were all infants and fetuses with anotia or microtia identified by a population-based birth defects registry in Hawaii. The anotia and microtia rates were determined for selected factors and comparisons made among the subgroups by calculating the rate ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). A total of 120 cases were identified, for a rate of 3.79 per 10,000 live births. The anotia and microtia rate increased during 1986-2002, although the trend was not significant (P = 0.715). Of 49 specific structural birth defects examined, four were found to be significantly more common in the presence of anotia and microtia. When compared with Caucasians, the anotia and microtia rates were higher among Far East Asians (RR 1.79, 95% CI 0.89-3.68), Pacific Islanders (RR 2.26, 95% CI 1.24-4.32), and Filipinos (RR 2.34, 95% CI 1.23-4.64).

Posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy (PPCD) is a rare autosomal dominant genetically heterogeneous disorder. Nineteen Czech PPCD pedigrees with 113 affected family members were identified, and 17 of these kindreds were genotyped for markers on chromosome 20p12.1- 20q12. Comparison of haplotypes in 81 affected members, 20 unaffected first degree relatives and 13 spouses, as well as 55 unrelated controls, supported the hypothesis of a shared ancestor in 12 families originating from one geographic location. In 38 affected individuals from nine of these pedigrees, a common haplotype was observed between D20S48 and D20S107 spanning approximately 23 Mb, demonstrating segregation of disease with the PPCD1 locus. This haplotype was not detected in 110 ethnically matched control chromosomes. Within the common founder haplotype, a core mini-haplotype was detected for D20S605, D20S182 and M189K2 in all 67 affected members from families 1-12, however alleles representing the core mini-haplotype were also detected in population matched controls. The most likely location of the responsible gene within the disease interval, and estimated mutational age, were inferred by linkage disequilibrium mapping (DMLE+2.3). The appearance of a disease-causing mutation was dated between 64-133 generations. The inferred ancestral locus carrying a PPCD1 disease-causing variant within the disease interval spans 60 Kb on 20p11.23, which contains a single known protein coding gene, ZNF133. However, direct sequence analysis of coding and untranslated exons did not reveal a potential pathogenic mutation. Microdeletion or duplication was also excluded by comparative genomic hybridization using a dense chromosome 20 specific array. Geographical origin, haplotype and statistical analysis suggest that in 14 unrelated families an as yet undiscovered mutation on 20p11.23 was inherited from a common ancestor.

Castleman disease (CD) is a rare lymphoproliferative disorder affecting single (unicentric; UCD) or multiple (multicentric; MCD) lymph nodes. The incidence of this difficult to diagnose disease is poorly understood, as no International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) code is available. This study utilized a unique strategy to estimate its incidence using two commercial claims databases, IMS LifeLink™ and Truven Health Analytics MarketScan(®). Patients with an index diagnosis of lymphadenopathy (ICD-9 code 785.6) were followed longitudinally for 1 year prior to and 2 years post-index diagnosis date. An algorithm that identifies potential patients with CD was developed to determine the incidence rate in person-years. The incidence rate for CD was calculated as 21 (IMS LifeLink™) and 25 (MarketScan(®)) per million person-years. Additionally, 23% of patients with CD were identified as potentially suffering from MCD. These results are consistent with the definition of an orphan disease, and the low incidence of the disease estimated in the literature.",['GARD:0012656'],{'Castleman disease'},{'Worldwide'},{'incidence'},['per million person']

We used UROD gene sequencing as the reference standard in assessing the diagnostic accuracy of UROD activity, evaluating the mutation spectrum of the UROD gene, determining the frequency and disease attributes of PCT and its subtypes in Norway, and developing diagnostic models that use clinical and laboratory characteristics for differentiating fPCT and sPCT.<h4>Methods</h4>All consecutive patients with PCT diagnosed within a 6-year period were used for incidence calculations. UROD activity analysis, UROD gene sequencing, analysis of hemochromatosis mutations, and registration of clinical and laboratory data were carried out for 253 patients.<h4>Results</h4>Fifty-three percent of the patients had disease-relevant mutations, 74% of which were c.578G>C or c.636+1G>C. The UROD activity at the optimal cutoff had a likelihood ratio (LR) of 9.2 for fPCT, whereas a positive family history had an LR of 19. A logistic regression model indicated that low UROD activity, a high uroporphyrin-heptaporphyrin ratio, a young age at diagnosis, male sex, and low alcohol consumption were predictors of fPCT. The incidence of PCT was 1 in 100 000.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Two commonly occurring mutations are responsible for the high frequency of fPCT in Norway. UROD activity has a high diagnostic accuracy for differentiating the 2 PCT types, and a model that takes into account both clinical information and laboratory test results can be used to predict fPCT.",['GARD:0007433'],"{'Porphyria cutanea tarda', 'porphyria cutanea tarda'}",{'norway'},"{'incidence', 'occurs'}",['fifty']

Three families presenting with X-linked recessive Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathies (CMT) were studied both clinically and genetically. The disease phenotype in family 1 was typical of CMT type 1, except for an infantile onset; two of five affected individuals were mentally retarded, and obligate-carrier females were unaffected. Families 2 and 3 showed distal atrophy with weakness, juvenile onset, and normal intelligence. Motor-nerve conduction velocities were significantly slowed, and electromyography data were consistent with denervation in affected CMT males in all three families. Thirty X-linked RFLPs were tested for linkage studies against the CMT disease loci. Family 1 showed tight linkage (recombination fraction [theta] = 0) to Xp22.2 markers DXS16, DXS143, and DXS43, with peak lod scores of 1.75, 1.78, and 2.04, respectively. A maximum lod score of 3.48 at DXS16 (theta = 0) was obtained by multipoint linkage analysis of the map DXS143-DXS16-DXS43. In families 2 and 3 there was suggestion of tight linkage (theta = 0) to Xq26 markers DXS86, DXS144, and DXS105, with peak lod scores of 2.29, 1.33, and 2.32, respectively. The combined maximum multipoint lod score of 1.81 at DXS144 (theta = 0) for these two families occurred in the map DXS10-DXS144-DXS51-DXS105-DXS15-DXS52++ +. A joint homogeneity analysis including both regions (Xp22.2 and Xq26-28) provided evidence against homogeneity (chi 2 = 9.12, P less than .005).

Epilepsy and Mental Retardation limited to Females (EFMR) which links to Xq22 has been reported in only one family. We aimed to determine if there was a distinctive phenotype that would enhance recognition of this disorder. We ascertained four unrelated families (two Australian, two Israeli) where seizures in females were transmitted through carrier males. Detailed clinical assessment was performed on 58 individuals, using a validated seizure questionnaire, neurological examination and review of EEG and imaging studies. Gene localization was examined using Xq22 microsatellite markers. Twenty-seven affected females had a mean seizure onset of 14 months (range 6-36) typically presenting with convulsions. All had convulsive attacks at some stage, associated with fever in 17 out of 27 (63%). Multiple seizure types occurred including tonic-clonic (26), tonic (4), partial (11), absence (5), atonic (3) and myoclonic (4). Seizures ceased at mean 12 years. Developmental progress varied from normal (7), to always delayed (4) to normal followed by regression (12). Intellect ranged from normal to severe intellectual disability (ID), with 67% of females having ID or being of borderline intellect. Autistic (6), obsessive (9) and aggressive (7) features were prominent. EEGs showed generalized and focal epileptiform abnormalities. Five obligate male carriers had obsessional tendencies. Linkage to Xq22 was confirmed (maximum lod 3.5 at = 0). We conclude that EFMR is a distinctive, under-recognized familial syndrome where girls present with convulsions in infancy, often associated with intellectual impairment and autistic features. The unique inheritance pattern with transmission by males is perplexing. Clinical recognition is straightforward in multiplex families due to the unique inheritance pattern; however, this disorder should be considered in smaller families where females alone have seizures beginning in infancy, particularly in the setting of developmental delay.

We describe 4 children treated with sarcoma-like therapy and review the literature to evaluate outcome in relation to treatment modalities.<h4>Procedure</h4>Reports from 1995 to 2007, describing clinical features of children (< or =18 years) were reviewed for details of demography, therapy, and outcome. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were used to study the impact of clinical features, demography, and therapy on overall survival (OS).<h4>Results</h4>The median OS for patients treated with multiagent chemotherapy (n=79) was 17.3 months (range, 1.5-93 mo); unrelated to age at diagnosis, sex, tumor site, and extent of resection. Overall mortality was 67%. Disease progression (craniospinal spread in 58%) was the major cause of death. Patients (n=30) treated with intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy had significantly higher 2-year OS [64% (95% confidence interval, 46.5-82.0) vs. 17.3% (95% confidence interval, 5.4-29.3); P<0.0001] and lower prevalence of distant CNS metastasis compared with those without IT therapy (n=49) (20% vs. 59.2%; P=0.001).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Despite dismal OS, multimodal therapy can induce remission even in metastatic CNS ATRT with partial resection.

Over 50 mutations have been reported, mainly causing autosomal dominant disease, though families with homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations have been described. We present 3 families with early-onset CMT2 associated with compound heterozygous MFN2 mutations. Transcriptional analysis was performed to investigate the effects of the mutations.<h4>Methods</h4>Patients were examined clinically and electrophysiologically; parents were also examined where available. Genetic investigations included MFN2 DNA sequencing and dosage analysis by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. MFN2 mRNA transcripts from blood lymphocytes were analyzed in 2 families.<h4>Results</h4>Compound heterozygosity for MFN2 mutations was associated with early-onset CMT2 of varying severity between pedigrees. Parents, where examined, were unaffected and were heterozygous for the expected mutations. Four novel mutations were detected (one missense, one nonsense, an intragenic deletion of exons 7 + 8, and a 3-base pair deletion), as well as 2 previously reported missense mutations. Transcriptional analysis demonstrated aberrant splicing of the exonic deletion and indicated nonsense-mediated decay of mutant alleles with premature truncating mutations.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our findings confirm that MFN2 mutations can cause early-onset CMT2 with apparent recessive inheritance. Novel genetic findings include an intragenic MFN2 deletion and nonsense-mediated decay. Carrier parents were asymptomatic, suggesting that MFN2 null alleles can be nonpathogenic unless coinherited with another mutation.",['GARD:0006034'],{'Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease'},{'Worldwide'},set(),['7']

Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4H (CMT4H) is an autosomal recessive demyelinating subtype of peripheral enuropathies caused by mutations in the FGD4 gene. Most CMT4H patients are in consanguineous Mediterranean families characterized by early onset and slow progression. We identified two CMT4H patients from a Korean CMT cohort, and performed a detailed genetic and clinical analysis in both cases. Both patients from nonconsanguineous families showed characteristic clinical manifestations of CMT4H including early onset, scoliosis, areflexia, and slow disease progression. Exome sequencing revealed novel compound heterozygous mutations in FGD4 as the underlying cause in both families (p.Arg468Gln and c.1512-2A>C in FC73, p.Met345Thr and c.2043+1G>A (p.Trp663Trpfs*30) in FC646). The missense mutations were located in highly conserved RhoGEF and PH domains which were predicted to be pathogenic in nature by in silico modeling. The CMT4H occurrence frequency was calculated to 0.7% in the Korean demyelinating CMT patients. This study is the first report of CMT4H in Korea.

There was slight slowing of conduction velocities in 36% of nerves; however, only 3 out of 10 affected members had entirely normal conduction studies. The amplitude of the sensory potentials of median and peroneal nerves was almost uniformly reduced. In all affected patients electromyography of anterior tibial muscles showed signs of neurogenic involvement. Histological study of two sural nerves and a sciatic nerve and its branches revealed loss of myelinated fibres with a proximal-to-distal gradient in this fibre loss, clusters of small regenerating fibres, and atrophic axons. Postmortem study of the proband showed loss of anterior horn and dorsal root ganglion neurons in the lumbar and sacral segments and degeneration of the fasciculus gracilis. Morphometric evaluation of L5 ventral and dorsal roots revealed a normal number of myelinated fibres, diameter histograms being shifted to the left because of a significant loss of large myelinated fibres and regeneration.

Clinical, electrophysiological and genetic linkage studies were performed on a large autosomal dominant family with Charcot-Marie-Tooth axonal neuropathy type 2 (CMT2) with 38 members of which 14 were affected. Onset of the disease was between 16 and 30 years of age with weakness and atrophy of the hands more severe than of the feet with slow progressive course in 12 patients. Deep tendon reflexes were absent in the upper extremities and decreased in the lower extremities. There was distal hypesthesia for touch, proprioception and vibration sense for the hands more than for the feet. Motor nerve conduction velocities showed normal values (48-53 M/s) with normal latencies (2-3 msec) and electromyography revealed signs of denervation. Genetic linkage analysis used 167 short tandem repeat markers (STRPs) spaced throughout the 22 autosomes. Linkage to the short arm of chromosome 7 at 7p14 was found using the marker D7S435 (Z = 4.83 at theta = 0). Flanking markers were D7S1808 and D7S1806 and the genetic distance between them was 6.8 cM. The multipoint linkage analysis gave a peek multipoint lod score of 6.89 between the markers D7S1808 and D7S435. Linkage analysis showed significantly negative lod scores (with values less than -2) with markers of chromosomes 1 and 3 where CMT axonal forms have been previously mapped.

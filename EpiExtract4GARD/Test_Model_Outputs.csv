"<h4>Background</h4>The incidence of hydrocephalus in the spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) population relative to the general population is currently unknown. Since the approval of nusinersen, an intrathecally administered drug for SMA, a small number of hydrocephalus cases among nusinersen users have been reported. Currently, the incidence of hydrocephalus in untreated SMA patients is not available, thereby making it difficult to determine if hydrocephalus is a side effect of nusinersen or part of SMA's natural history. This retrospective, matched cohort study used electronic health records (EHRs) to estimate and compare the incidence of hydrocephalus in both SMA patients and matched non-SMA controls in the time period prior to the approval of nusinersen.<h4>Methods</h4>The U.S. Optum® de-identified EHR database contains records for approximately 100 million persons. The current study period spanned January 1, 2007-December 22, 2016. Patients with SMA were identified by one or more International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9 and/or ICD-10 codes for SMA appearing as primary, admission, or discharge diagnoses, without a pregnancy diagnostic code in the 1-year time before and after the first occurrence of SMA. The first occurrence of SMA defined the index date and non-SMA controls were matched to cases. Incident cases of hydrocephalus were identified with one or more ICD-9 and/or ICD-10 code for any type of hydrocephalus following the index date. Hydrocephalus incidence rates per person-months and the incidence rate ratio comparing SMA cases with non-SMA controls were calculated.<h4>Results</h4>There were 5354 SMA cases and an equal number of matched non-SMA controls. Incident hydrocephalus events were identified in 42 SMA cases and 9 non-SMA controls. Hydrocephalus incidence rates per 100,000 person-months were 15.5 (95% CI: 11.2-20.9) among SMA cases and 3.3 (95% CI: 1.5-6.3) among non-SMA controls. The incidence rate ratio was 4.7 (95% CI: 2.4-10.2).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Based on this retrospective analysis utilizing US EHR data, SMA patients had an approximately fourfold increased risk of hydrocephalus compared with non-SMA controls in the era preceding nusinersen treatment. This study may assist in properly evaluating adverse events in nusinersen-treated SMA patients.",{'GARD:0013519'},{'spinal muscular atrophy'},"{'occurrence', 'incidence'}","{'incidence rates per 100 , 000 person', '##lus', '5', '1 , 2007'}","{'us', 'i', 'u . s'}"
"<h4>Introduction</h4>Limited data are available on the incidence of primary ophthalmic cancers worldwide. We describe the incidence and trends of primary ophthalmic cancers in Singapore.<h4>Methods</h4>Data on ophthalmic cancers diagnosed in Singapore from 1996 to 2016 were retrieved from the Singapore Cancer Registry for analysis. All were histologically proven primary ophthalmic cancers. Calculations of incidence and age-specific frequency of ophthalmic malignancy were made.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 297 cases were included, with males constituting 59.9%. The race distribution was 78.5% Chinese, 16.5% Malay, 3.7% Indians and 1.3% others. There was an overall increase in ophthalmic malignancies. The mean age of onset was 47.4 years. The most common cancers were retinoblastoma (93.3%) in patients younger than 15 years, and lymphoma (71.3%) in patients aged 15 years and older. There has been an increase in lymphomas from 16.7% in 1968-1995 to 71.3% in 1996-2016 in those aged 15 years and older. The most common types of ophthalmic cancer according to location are lymphoma of the orbit, conjunctiva, cornea and lacrimal gland; retinoblastoma of the retina; and malignant melanoma of the choroid and ciliary body.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our study reported the incidence and trends of ophthalmic cancer in the Singapore population and showed an overall increase in ophthalmic malignancies in Singapore from 1996-2016. A substantial increase in lymphomas over the last 2 decades was noted. The data could aid clinicians, epidemiologists and policymakers in implementing strategies to address trends in ophthalmic cancers and spur aetiological research to improve quality of life in patients with such cancers.",set(),set(),{'incidence'},"{'16 . 5 %', '78 . 5 %', '93 . 3 %', '3 . 7 %', '59 . 9 %', '1 . 3 %', '16 . 7 %', '1995 to 71 . 3 %', '71 . 3 %'}","{'worldwide', 'singapore'}"
"Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis is one of the most prevalent chronic diseases in children, with an annual incidence of 2-20 cases per 100,000 and a prevalence of 16-150 per 100,000. It is associated with several complications that can cause short-term or long-term disability and reduce the quality of life. Among these, growth and pubertal disorders play an important role. Chronic inflammatory conditions are often associated with growth failure ranging from slight decrease in height velocity to severe forms of short stature. The prevalence of short stature in JIA varies from 10.4% in children with polyarticular disease to 41% of patients with the systemic form, while oligoarthritis is mostly associated with localized excessive bone growth of the affected limb, leading to limb dissymmetry. The pathogenesis of growth disorders is multifactorial and includes the role of chronic inflammation, long-term use of corticosteroids, undernutrition, altered body composition, delay of pubertal onset or slow pubertal progression. These factors can exert a systemic effect on the GH/IGF-1 axis and on the GnRH-gonadotropin-gonadic axis, or a local influence on the growth plate homeostasis and function. Although new therapeutic options are available to control inflammation, there are still 10-20% of patients with severe forms of the disease who show continuous growth impairment, ending in a short final stature. Moreover, delayed puberty is associated with a reduction in the peak bone mass with the possibility of concomitant or future bone fragility. Monitoring of puberty and bone health is essential for a complete health assessment of adolescents with JIA. In these patients, an assessment of the pubertal stage every 6 months from the age of 9 years is recommended. Also, linear growth should be always evaluated considering the patient's bone age. The impact of rhGH therapy in children with JIA is still unclear, but it has been shown that if rhGH is added at high dose in a low-inflammatory condition, post steroids and on biologic therapy, it is able to favor a prepubertal growth acceleration, comparable with the catch-up growth response in GH-deficient patients. Here we provide a comprehensive review of the pathogenesis of puberty and growth disorders in children with JIA, which can help the pediatrician to properly and timely assess the presence of growth and pubertal disorders in JIA patients.","{'GARD:0003682', 'GARD:0010604', 'GARD:0004213'}","{'growth failure', 'short stature', 'bone fragility'}","{'incidence', 'prevalence'}","{'2 - 20 cases per 100 , 000 and', '16 - 150 per 100 , 000', '10 - 20 %', '10 . 4 %', 'disease to 41 %'}",set()
"<h4>Aim</h4>To investigate the point prevalence of hereditary neuromuscular disorders on January 1, 2020 in Northern Norway.<h4>Methods</h4>From January 1, 1999, until January 1, 2020, we screened medical and genetic hospital records in Northern Norway for hereditary neuromuscular disorders.<h4>Results</h4>We identified 542 patients with a hereditary neuromuscular disorder living in Northern Norway, giving a point prevalence of 111.9/100,000 on January 1, 2020. The prevalence of children (<18 years old) and adults (≥18 years old) were 57.8/100,000 and 125.1/100,000, respectively. Inherited neuropathies had a prevalence of 38.8/100,000. Charcot-Marie-Tooth and hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies had a prevalence of 29.9/100,000 and 8.3/100,000, respectively. We calculated a prevalence of 3.7/100,000 for spinal muscular atrophies and 2.4/100,000 for Kennedy disease. Inherited myopathies were found in 67.7/100,000. Among these, we registered 13.4/100,000 myotonic dystrophy type 1, 6.8/100,000 myotonic dystrophy type 2, 7.3/100,000 Duchenne muscular dystrophy, 1.6/100,000 Becker muscular dystrophy, 3.7/100,000 facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, 12.8/100,000 limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, 2.5/100,000 hypokalemic periodic paralysis and 11.4/100,000 myotonia congenita.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our total prevalence was higher than previously hypothesized in European population-based studies. The prevalence was especially high for myotonia congenita and limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. The prevalence of Charcot-Marie-Tooth polyneuropathy was higher than in most European studies, but lower than previously reported in epidemiological studies in other regions of Norway.","{'GARD:0006818', 'GARD:0003976', 'GARD:0012531', 'GARD:0006291', 'GARD:0005221', 'GARD:0006729', 'GARD:0005900', 'GARD:0009728', 'GARD:0009941', 'GARD:0008310', 'GARD:0012301'}","{'duchenne muscular dystrophy', 'facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy', 'myotonia congenita', 'hypokalemic periodic paralysis', 'kennedy disease', 'of children', 'becker muscular dystrophy', 'limb-girdle muscular dystrophy', 'myotonic dystrophy type 1', 'myotonic dystrophy type 2', 'hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies'}",{'prevalence'},"{'8 . 3 /', '1 , 2020', '111 . 9 /', '2 , 7 . 3 /', '11 . 4 /', '125 . 1 /', '2 . 4 /', '3 . 7 /', '38 . 8 /', '57 . 8 /', '29 . 9 /', '67 . 7 /', '12 . 8 /', '1 , 6 . 8 /', '1 . 6 /', '1 , 1999', '2 . 5 /', '13 . 4 /'}","{'norway', 'northern norway'}"
"<h4>Background</h4>Many epidemiological studies have indicated that inbreeding has little or no effect on the incidence of cancer. Due to the high prevalence of consanguinity in Qatar (54%), its influence may nevertheless be of special importance.<h4>Aim</h4>The aim of this study was to examine whether parental consanguinity affects the risk of cancer in a local Arab highly inbred population.<h4>Design</h4>Matched case-control study.<h4>Setting</h4>The study was carried out in Al-Amal cancer hospital and primary health care centers in Qatar over a period from August 2008 to February 2009.<h4>Subjects and methods</h4>The study included 370 Qataris and other Arab expatriates with various types of cancers and 635 controls matched by age and ethnicity. A questionnaire that included socio-demographic information, type of consanguinity, medical history, and tumor grade was designed to collect the information of cases and controls.<h4>Results</h4>The study revealed that the rate of parental consanguinity was similar in both cases (29.5%) and controls (29.9%) with a higher inbreeding coefficient in controls (0.017-/+0.03), compared to cancer patients (0.0155-/+0.03). Other Arab expatriates had a higher incidence of cancer (61.1%) than Qataris (38.9%). The inbreeding coefficient was higher in male cancer patients (0.0189-/+0.03), but lower in female cancer patients (0.014-/+0.03) as compared to controls. Controls were more inbred in the overall studied subjects (23.6%) and women (23.8%) than cases. The coefficient of inbreeding was lower in patients with breast (0.014), skin (0.012), thyroid (0.008) and female genital (0.014) cancers, whereas it was higher in cases for leukemia and lymphoma (0.018), colorectal (0.025) and prostate (0.017), with no significant difference between cases and controls. No significant differences were observed between cases and controls in the parental consanguinity, mean coefficient of inbreeding and proportion of more inbred subjects.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The study findings revealed that although the consanguinity rate is high in our Arab population, it has no effect on the incidence of cancers overall. However, there was an increased risk found for leukemia and lymphoma, colorectal and prostate cancer groups, but a reduced risk in breast, skin, thyroid and female genital cancer groups.",{'GARD:0004520'},{'prostate cancer'},"{'incidence', 'prevalence'}","{'38 . 9 %', '54 %', '0 . 0189 - / +', '23 . 6 %', '0 .', '0 . 014 - / +', '23 . 8 %', '03', '0155 - /', '29 . 5 %', '017 - /', '61 . 1 %', '29 . 9 %'}",{'qatar'}
"Neonatal herpes simplex virus infection (HSV) is rare in neonates, with an estimated global incidence of 10 per 100,000 live births. Neonatal HSV is challenging to diagnose due to often vague signs and symptoms. Untreated, the mortality of some HSV subtypes exceeds 80%. Overtesting and overtreatment can result in prolonged hospitalizations and expose neonates to medication toxicity. In contrast, prompt evaluation and use of empiric antiviral therapy before the results of definitive testing can improve outcomes for infants with HSV. A wide degree of practice variation exists with respect to testing and treatment for neonatal HSV, and more research is required to safely risk-stratify this population.

"Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are rare neoplasms, with an estimated annual incidence of 6.9/100 000. They arise from cells of the diffuse endocrine system, which are mainly dispersed throughout the gastrointestinal (GI), pancreatic, and respiratory tracts. The incidence of GI-NETs has recently begun to show a steady increase. According to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database, 53% of patients with NETs present with localized disease, 20% with locoregional disease, and 27% with distant metastases at the time of diagnosis. Surgery is the mainstay for the treatment of locoregional GI-NETs. Endoscopic resection is an option for well-differentiated early GI-NETs, which are thought to very rarely metastasize to lymph nodes. A lesion that is technically difficult to resect via endoscopy is an indication for local resection (partial resection without lymph node dissection). GI-NETs with possible lymph node metastasis is an indication for enterectomy with lymph node dissection. For NETs with metastatic lesions, cytoreduction surgery can control hormonal hypersecretion and alleviate symptoms; therefore, cytoreduction surgery is recommended. The indications for surgery vary and are based on the organ where the NET arose; therefore, an understanding of the patient's clinical state and individualized treatment that is based on the characteristics of the patient's GI-NET is needed. This review summarizes surgical treatments of GI-NETs in each organ.",set(),set(),{'incidence'},"{'6 . 9 /', '20 %', '27 %', '53 %'}",set()
"<h4>Background</h4>Most epidemiological data on vitiligo refer to selected environments or focus on the prevalence of comorbidity unrelated to the population.<h4>Objective</h4>Aim of the study was to gain robust representative prevalence data on vitiligo and on associated dermatologic comorbidity in the German adult population.<h4>Methods</h4>A dual population-based approach was applied with 1) primary data obtained between 2004 and 2014 from dermatological exams in the general working population; 2) claims data from a large German statutory health insurance, reference year 2010.<h4>Results</h4>In the working cohort (N = 121,783; 57% male; mean age 43 years), the prevalence of vitiligo was 0.77% (0.84% in men; 0.67% in women). In the claims data (N = 1,619,678; 38% male; mean age 46 years), prevalence was 0.17% (0.14% in men; 0.18% in women). In the working cohort, vitiligo was significantly more common in people with fair skin type, ephelides and port-wine stains and less common in people with acne and solar lentigines. In the claims data, vitiligo was associated with a variety of skin conditions, eg, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis and alopecia areata.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The resulting discrepancy of claims vs primary data between 0.17% and 0.77% indicates the most probable spectrum of vitiligo prevalence in Germany. It is more frequently observed in clinical exams than recorded in claims data, indicating a marked proportion of people seeking no medical help.

Our case reported a child with autism who presented with arthralgia and anaemia. Systemic lupus erythematosus was the first diagnostic impression, resulting in over investigation and delayed diagnosis of vitamin C deficiency. After the child was treated with ascorbic acid, the child's symptoms resolved. This case highlighted the importance of developmental and nutritional history taking in the paediatric population.

"<h4>Background</h4>The prevalence of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) has been increasing worldwide and the highest prevalence ratio among Asian countries was reported in Iran. This study aims to estimate the increase in MS occurrence during more than three decades in Tehran and forecast the future condition of the disease using time series approaches for the next ten years.<h4>Methods</h4>The cross-sectional study was conducted from 1999 to 2019 based on records of MS cases from Iranian MS Society (IMSS) registry system. The prevalence was estimated using population data presented by the Statistical Centre of Iran. Through Bayesian Structural Time Series (BSTS) model, we want to predict the prevalence of familial and sporadic MS in the next ten years. .<h4>Results</h4>Among 22,421 cases with MS, 16,831 (75.1 %) were female and 5589 (24.9 %) were male. Female to male ratio was 3.0:1 and the number of familial MS cases were 2982 (13.3 %) of subjects. Female gender was less responsible for higher rate of MS in familial definition (beta = 0.020) in comparison to sporadic cases (beta = 0.034). Forecasting by BSTS revealed an increase in MS prevalence for the next ten years so that the prevalence rate for total, familial and sporadic MS respectively begins with 189.50 (183.94-195.14), 25.69 (24.97-26.45) and 163.74(159.06-168.57) in 2020 and ends with 220.84 (171.48-266.92), 30.79 (24.16-37.15), and 189.33(146.97-230.19) in 2029.<h4>Conclusions</h4>According to the findings, MS prevalence increased during three decades and it will increase over the next ten years. Tehran province is one of the regions with highest MS prevalence in Asia. The results of present study indicated that females are at higher risk for MS than males in both sporadic and familial MS.",{'GARD:0010443'},{'multiple sclerosis'},"{'occurrence', 'prevalence'}",{'1'},"{'asia', 'tehran', 'ms', 'worldwide', 'iran'}"
"<h4>Objective</h4>In observational data, lower levels of lipoprotein(a) have been associated with greater prevalence of type 2 diabetes. Whether pharmacologic lowering of lipoprotein(a) influences incident type 2 diabetes is unknown. We determined the relationship of lipoprotein(a) concentration with incident type 2 diabetes and effects of treatment with alirocumab, a PCSK9 inhibitor.<h4>Research design and methods</h4>In the ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trial alirocumab was compared with placebo in patients with acute coronary syndrome. Incident diabetes was determined from laboratory, medication, and adverse event data.<h4>Results</h4>Among 13,480 patients without diabetes at baseline, 1,324 developed type 2 diabetes over a median 2.7 years. Median baseline lipoprotein(a) was 21.9 mg/dL. With placebo, 10 mg/dL lower baseline lipoprotein(a) was associated with hazard ratio 1.04 (95% CI 1.02-1.06, <i>P</i> < 0.001) for incident type 2 diabetes. Alirocumab reduced lipoprotein(a) by a median 23.2% with greater absolute reductions from higher baseline levels and no overall effect on incident type 2 diabetes (hazard ratio 0.95, 95% CI 0.85-1.05). At low baseline lipoprotein(a) levels, alirocumab tended to reduce incident type 2 diabetes, while at high baseline lipoprotein(a) alirocumab tended to increase incident type 2 diabetes compared with placebo (treatment-baseline lipoprotein(a) interaction <i>P</i> = 0.006). In the alirocumab group, a 10 mg/dL decrease in lipoprotein(a) from baseline was associated with hazard ratio 1.07 (95% CI 1.03-1.12; <i>P</i> = 0.0002) for incident type 2 diabetes.<h4>Conclusions</h4>In patients with acute coronary syndrome, baseline lipoprotein(a) concentration associated inversely with incident type 2 diabetes. Alirocumab had neutral overall effect on incident type 2 diabetes. However, treatment-related reductions in lipoprotein(a), more pronounced from high baseline levels, were associated with increased risk of incident type 2 diabetes.

"<h4>Background</h4>The prevalence of perinatal infection from maternal exposure is increasing. The prevalence of acute maternal infections identifies cytomegalovirus, parvovirus B19, toxoplasmosis, and varicella as the most common organisms and in the order of frequency. Maternal informed consent and understanding is required before intrauterine testing for fetal infectious and possible genetic risk assessment.<h4>Methods</h4>This structured review of the reproductive published literature focuses on the risks of amniocentesis and cordocentesis diagnostic procedure-related fetal loss rates and fetal vertical transmission (VT) rates from published infected pregnant cohorts.<h4>Results</h4>The total postprocedure fetal loss rate for diagnostic amniocentesis procedures, in limited infectious cohorts, is 1.5% and does not appear to be increased compared to ""noninfected"" amniocentesis cohorts using an estimated background spontaneous fetal loss rate (no procedure) of 0.65%. The ""pooled"" unintended fetal loss rate is from small infected population cohorts, but can be used for counseling purposes. Postcordocentesis fetal loss risk, in an infected cohort, is not possible to estimate due to limited data. The ""biological spontaneous fetal loss rate"" risk with a perinatal infection (positive or negative fetal anomalies) and no diagnostic procedure before 20 weeks of gestation is reviewed. The risk of VT in acute infection cohorts as a result of the intra-amniotic diagnostic procedure is not found to be increased.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The unintended ""fetal loss"" rate after amniocentesis for perinatal infected cohorts is similar to that of noninfected cohorts, but the estimate is based on limited infected cohorts. There was no procedure-based risk of fetal VT in the infected cohorts, but identification of postprocedure maternal bleeding into the amniotic cavity increases the potential risk.

"A molecular epidemiological study was conducted in a population of 9422 blood donors in the province of Corrientes, Northeastern Argentina, to determine the prevalence of Human T-cell lymphotropic virus types 1 and 2 (HTLV-1/2), the phylogenetic identification of HTLV-1 and 2 subtypes/subgroups and perform a mutation analysis. Based on the results obtained, it was shown that both HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 are circulating in a low-risk population of Corrientes, although with a similar prevalence to that of non-endemic areas. Phylogenetic studies identified the HTLV-1 Cosmopolitan subtype Transcontinental subgroup (Aa), and the HTLV-2 subtype b. Infected donors reported neither a history of risk factors such as transfusions, intravenous drug use, nor risky or HTLV-1/2 seropositive sexual partners. These results suggest that these viruses were transmitted from mother to child, possibly from generation to generation, and that these strains were introduced into the Caucasian population of this region from ancestors originating from endemic areas of the country either from or through contact with individuals from other countries years ago. Our results demonstrate for the first time the presence of HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 in the province of Corrientes. Moreover, although the province can be considered a non-endemic area, the need to include these retroviruses in a national Public Health program is highlighted, in order to have qualified professionals duly trained to make their diagnosis and provide the necessary information in relation to primary care and patient follow-up.",{'GARD:0008435'},{'types 1 and 2'},{'prevalence'},"{'1 / 2', '1', '1 and 2'}","{'northeastern argentina', 'corrientes'}"
"<h4>Background</h4>Unilateral lung agenesis is an uncommon congenital abnormality, with a lack of reported accurate incidence estimates.

"Hearing loss is one of the most common birth disorders in humans, with an estimated prevalence of 1-3 in every 1000 newborns. This study investigates the molecular etiology of a hearing loss cohort using a stepwise strategy to effectively diagnose patients and address the challenges posed by the genetic heterogeneity and variable mutation spectrum of hearing loss. In order to target known pathogenic variants, multiplex PCR plus next-generation sequencing was applied in the first step; patients which did not receive a diagnosis from this were further referred for exome sequencing. A total of 92 unrelated patients with nonsyndromic hearing loss were enrolled in the study. In total, 64% (59/92) of the patients were molecularly diagnosed, 44 of them in the first step by multiplex PCR plus sequencing. Exome sequencing resulted in eleven diagnoses (23%, 11/48) and four probable diagnoses (8%, 4/48) among the 48 patients who were not diagnosed in the first step. The rate of secondary findings from exome sequencing in our cohort was 3% (2/58).

As a reference cohort, we randomly selected 10 citizens for each patient, matched by sex and birth year. Using the Fine and Gray competing risk regression, we estimated the cumulative incidences of suicide and self-harm, and Cox proportional regression analysis was used to compare the risk of suicide and deliberate self-harm in patients with CHD with the reference cohort. We identified 14 433 patients with CHD. Mean follow-up was 21.3 years, with a maximum follow-up of 42 years. Since the time of diagnosis, 2659 patients had died, with a median age of death of 23 years. A total of 15 patients had died by suicide, compared with 232 suicides in the reference cohort. Patients with CHD had a low and similar risk of dying by suicide when compared with the reference cohort (cause-specific hazard ratio, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.48-1.37; and subhazard ratio, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.41-1.16). We identified 336 events of self-harm among patients with CHD, and 3484 events in the reference group. The overall risk of deliberate self-harm was not increased in patients with CHD when compared with the reference group (subhazard ratio, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.85-1.06). Conclusions This is the first study to estimate the risk of suicide and deliberate self-harm in patients with CHD. We found that patients with CHD do not have an increased risk of suicide or deliberate self-harm when compared with a large reference cohort.",{'GARD:0008586'},{'with congenital heart disease'},{'incidence'},set(),set()
"Little information is available on the prevalence, geographic distribution and mutation spectrum of genetic skeletal disorders (GSDs) in China. This study systematically reviewed GSDs as defined in ""Nosology and Classification of genetic skeletal disorders (2010 version)"" using Chinese biomedical literature published over the past 34 years from 1978 to 2012. In total, 16,099 GSDs have been reported. The most frequently reported disorders were Marfan syndrome, osteogenesis imperfecta, fibrous dysplasia, mucopolysaccharidosis, multiple cartilaginous exostoses, neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), osteopetrosis, achondroplasia, enchondromatosis (Ollier), and osteopoikilosis, accounting for 76.5% (12,312 cases) of the total cases. Five groups (group 8, 12, 14, 18, 21) defined by ""Nosology and Classification of genetic skeletal disorders"" have not been reported in the Chinese biomedical literature. Gene mutation testing was performed in only a minor portion of the 16,099 cases of GSDs (187 cases, 1.16%). In total, 37 genes for 41 different GSDs were reported in Chinese biomedical literature, including 43 novel mutations. This review revealed a significant imbalance in rare disease identification in terms of geographic regions and hospital levels, suggesting the need to create a national multi-level network to meet the specific challenge of care for rare diseases in China.","{'GARD:0008695', 'GARD:0006975', 'GARD:0006444', 'GARD:0007866'}","{'marfan syndrome', 'osteogenesis imperfecta', 'fibrous dysplasia', 'neurofibromatosis type 1'}",{'prevalence'},"{'1 . 16 %', '76 . 5 %'}",{'china'}
"Little information is available on the prevalences of birth defects in Korea. The aims of this study were to estimate recent prevalences of selected birth defects and to analyze the prevalence trends of these defects during the period from 2008 to 2014. Prevalences were calculated for 69 major birth defects using health insurance claim data obtained from the Korea National Health Insurance Service (NHIS). Prevalence rate ratios were calculated using Poisson regression to analyze trends over the 7-year study period. The overall prevalence of a major birth defect was 446.3 per 10,000 births (95% CI: 444.0⁻448.6); 470.9 per 10,000 births (95% CI: 467.6⁻474.2) for males and 420.2 per 10,000 births (95% CI: 417⁻423.4) for females. The prevalence rates of the most common birth defects over the study period were; septal defect (138.2 per 10,000; 95% CI: 136.9⁻139.5), congenital hip dislocation (652 per 10,000; 95% CI: 64.1⁻65.9), and ventricular septal defect (62.62 per 10,000; 95% CI: 61.7⁻63.5). During the study period, a significant increase in the prevalence of a major birth defect was observed with a prevalence rate ratio (PRR) of 1.091. The strongest trend was observed for renal dysplasia, which had a PRR of 1.275 (95% CI: 1.211⁻1.343), and upward trends were observed for urogenital anomalies, such as, renal agenesis (PRR 1.102, 95% CI: 1.067⁻1.138), undescended testis (PRR 1.082, 95% CI: 1.072⁻1.093) and hypospadias (PRR 1.067, 95% CI: 1.044⁻1.090). This study shows an overall increase in the prevalences of birth defects, including hypospadias and undescended testis, which are known to be associated with endocrine factors.

"<h4>Objective</h4>To determine the incidence, time trends, risk factors, and severity of herpes zoster in a population-based cohort of patients with newly diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis (RA) compared to a group of individuals without RA from the same population.<h4>Methods</h4>All residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota fulfilling for the first time the 1987 American College of Rheumatology criteria for RA between January 1, 1980 and December 31, 2007 and a cohort of similar residents without RA were assembled and followed by retrospective chart review until death, migration, or December 31, 2008.<h4>Results</h4>There was no difference in the presence of herpes zoster prior to the RA incidence/index date between the cohorts (P = 0.85). During followup, 84 patients with RA (rate 12.1 cases per 1,000 person-years) and 44 subjects without RA (rate 5.4 cases per 1,000 person-years) developed herpes zoster. Patients with RA were more likely to develop herpes zoster than those without RA (hazard ratio [HR] 2.4 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.7-3.5]). Herpes zoster occurred more frequently in patients diagnosed with RA more recently (HR 1.06 per year [95% CI 1.02-1.10]). Erosive disease, previous joint surgery, and use of hydroxychloroquine and corticosteroids were significantly associated with the development of herpes zoster in RA. There was no apparent association of herpes zoster with the use of methotrexate or biologic agents. Complications of herpes zoster occurred at a similar rate in both cohorts.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The incidence of herpes zoster is increased in RA and has risen in recent years. There also has been an increasing incidence of herpes zoster in more recent years in the general population.

"Mandatory folic acid fortification in the United States corresponded with a decline in the prevalence of spina bifida (SB). The aim of this study was to describe the epidemiologic characteristics of isolated versus non-isolated SB cases in both pre- and post-fortification periods. SB cases in the Slone Epidemiology Center Birth Defects Study from 1976 to 2011 without chromosomal anomalies and syndromes were included. A maternal interview, conducted within 6 months of delivery, collected information on demographics, reproductive history, diet, and supplement use. Daily folic acid intake in the periconceptional period was calculated using both dietary and supplement information and categorized as low intake (<400 µg/day) or high intake (≥400 µg/day). SB cases (n = 1170) were classified as isolated (80.4%) or non-isolated (19.1%). Non-isolated cases were further divided into subgroups based on accompanying major malformations (midline, renal, genital, heart, laterality). Compared to non-isolated cases, isolated cases were more likely to be white, non-Hispanic and have more than 12 years of education. Cases in the renal, genital, and heart subgroups had the lowest proportions of mothers with a high folic acid intake. The change from pre- to post-fortification was associated with a decrease in the proportion of isolated cases from 83% to 72%, though in both periods isolated cases were more likely to be female and their mothers were more likely to have high folic acid intake. These findings highlight the importance of separating isolated and non-isolated cases in etiologic research of SB.","{'GARD:0006345', 'GARD:0007673'}","{'and heart', 'spina bifida'}",{'prevalence'},"{'19 . 1 %', '80 . 4 %', '83 % to 72 %'}",{'the united states'}
"The aggressive lymphoma, extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma-nasal type, is strongly associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and is most common in Asia and in South and Central America. By contrast, incidence is low in the United States and Europe, where extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma represents only 0.2%-0.4% of all newly diagnosed non-Hodgkin lymphomas. At diagnosis, it is important to test for EBV DNA in plasma by polymerase chain reaction and to carry out positron emission tomography/computer tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the nasopharynx. In stage I/II disease, radiotherapy is the most important treatment modality, but in high-risk stage I/II disease (stage II, age > 60 y, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score ≥2, primary tumor invasion), it should be combined with chemotherapy. The most optimal responses are reached with nonmultidrug resistance-based therapy (eg, asparaginase- or platinum-based therapy). Therapeutic approaches consist of either platinum-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy or sequential chemoradiotherapy. The minimum dose of radiotherapy should be 50-56 Gy. Treatment of stage III/IV disease consists of 3 cycles of chemotherapy followed by autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation should only be considered in case of relapsed disease or after difficulty reaching complete remission.

"The temperate United States has experienced increasing incidence of mosquito-borne diseases. Recent studies conducted in Baltimore, MD have demonstrated a negative relationship between abundances of Aedes albopictus (Skuse) and Culex mosquitoes and mean neighborhood income level, but have not looked at the presence of pathogens. Mosquitoes collected from five socioeconomically variable neighborhoods were tested for infection by West Nile, chikungunya, and Zika viruses in 2015 and 2016, and again from four of the neighborhoods in 2017. Minimum infection rates of pooled samples were compared among neighborhoods for each year, as well as among individual blocks in 2017. West Nile virus was detected in both Ae. albopictus and Culex pools from all neighborhoods sampled in 2015 and 2017. No infected pools were detected in any year for chikungunya or Zika viruses, and none of the target viruses were detected in 2016. Infection rates were consistently higher for Culex than for Ae. albopictus. Minimum infection rate was negatively associated with mean neighborhood income for both species in 2015. Although earlier work has shown a positive association between block-level abandonment and mosquito abundance, no association was detected in this study. Still, we demonstrate that viral infection in mosquito pools can differ substantially across adjacent urban neighborhoods that vary by income. Though trap security and accessibility often inform city sampling locations, detecting and managing arboviral risk requires surveillance across neighborhoods that vary in socioeconomics, including lower income areas that may be less accessible and secure but have higher infection rates.",set(),set(),{'incidence'},set(),"{'baltimore', 'md', 'united states', 'west nile'}"
"<h4>Purpose of review</h4>The global prevalence of obesity has increased rapidly over the last decades, posing a severe threat to human health. Currently, bariatric surgery is the most effective therapy for patients with morbid obesity. It is unknown whether this treatment is also suitable for patients with obesity due to a confirmed genetic defect (genetic obesity disorders). Therefore, this review aims to elucidate the role of bariatric surgery in the treatment of genetic obesity.<h4>Recent findings</h4>In monogenic non-syndromic obesity, an underlying genetic defect seems to be the most important factor determining the efficacy of bariatric surgery. In syndromic obesity, bariatric surgery result data are scarce, and even though some promising follow-up results have been reported, caution is required as patients with more severe behavioral and developmental disorders might have poorer outcomes. There is limited evidence in support of bariatric surgery as a treatment option for genetic obesity disorders; hence, no strong statements can be made regarding the efficacy and safety of these procedures for these patients. However, considering that patients with genetic obesity often present with life-threatening obesity-related comorbidities, we believe that bariatric surgery could be considered a last-resort treatment option in selected patients.",set(),set(),{'prevalence'},set(),set()

"Isolated cleft palate (CPO) is the rarest form of oral clefting. The incidence of CPO varies substantially by geography from 1.3 to 25.3 per 10,000 live births, with the highest rates in British Columbia, Canada and the lowest rates in Nigeria, Africa. Stratified by ethnicity/race, the highest rates of CPO are observed in non-Hispanic Whites and the lowest in Africans; nevertheless, rates of CPO are consistently higher in females compared to males. Approximately fifty percent of cases born with cleft palate occur as part of a known genetic syndrome or with another malformation (e.g., congenital heart defects) and the other half occur as solitary defects, referred to often as non-syndromic clefts. The etiology of CPO is multifactorial involving genetic and environmental risk factors. Several animal models have yielded insight into the molecular pathways responsible for proper closure of the palate, including the BMP, TGF-β, and SHH signaling pathways. In terms of environmental exposures, only maternal tobacco smoke has been found to be strongly associated with CPO. Some studies have suggested that maternal glucocorticoid exposure may also be important. Clearly, there is a need for larger epidemiologic studies to further investigate both genetic and environmental risk factors and gene-environment interactions. In terms of treatment, there is a need for long-term comprehensive care including surgical, dental and speech pathology. Overall, five main themes emerge as critical in advancing research: (1) monitoring of the occurrence of CPO (capacity building); (2) detailed phenotyping of the severity (biology); (3) understanding of the genetic and environmental risk factors (primary prevention); (4) access to early detection and multidisciplinary treatment (clinical services); and (5) understanding predictors of recurrence and possible interventions among families with a child with CPO (secondary prevention).","{'GARD:0004166', 'GARD:0010078'}","{'cleft palate', 'congenital heart defects'}","{'occurrence', 'incidence'}","{'3 to 25 . 3 per 10 , 000 live', 'approximately fifty percent', '1 .'}","{'nigeria', 'british columbia', 'africa', 'canada'}"

Eighty-eight were type 1 diabetes (T1D), 51.1% female. Age of diagnosis was 0.8-24.5 years (y) (mean = 11.4 y, SD = 6.2y). 15.1% were 0-4y, 31.4% 5-9 y, 24.4% 10-14y, 19.8% 15-19y, and 9.3% 20-24y. Minimum incidence for the Mansehra tehsil administrative district was calculated as 1.0 per 100,000 population <15y/y, 1.2 per 100,000 < 20y/y and 1.1 per 100,000 < 25y/y; the degree of ascertainment could not be assessed. A further four patients were diagnosed with thiamine-responsive megaloblastic anaemia (TRMA), all male, three from the same consanguineous family, and were treated with high-dose thiamine. One other patient was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Three T1D and one TRMA patient died during the study period. The standardised mortality rate for T1D was 9.4, but vital status was unknown for 13 patients. The mean/median HbA1c of T1D patients seen in 2018/2019 was 9.1%/9.2% (76/77 mmol/mol).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Minimum T1D incidence in Mansehra tehsil is double the previously reported value for Pakistan (from 1990 to 1999), although is still low compared to most other countries.

Sixty-seven percent (53 of 79) of them had at least 1 coexisting autoimmune disease, and 4% (3 of 79) had cancer. GAD65 antibody values at initial evaluation were significantly higher among patients with classic SMS (median value, 623 nmol/L) than among patients with partial SMS (median value, 163 nmol/L) (P < .001). The initial GAD65 antibody value was positively correlated with the last follow-up Rankin score (P = .03). Among 20 patients who were GAD65 antibody seronegative (6 with classic SMS, 12 with partial SMS, and 2 with PERM), 15% (3 of 20) had at least 1 coexisting autoimmune disease, and 25% (5 of 20) had cancer (3 with amphiphysin autoimmunity and breast carcinoma and 2 with Hodgkin lymphoma). Excluding patients with PERM, all patients but 1 had sustained improvements with at least 1 γ-aminobutyric acid agent, usually diazepam; the median dosage for patients with classic SMS was 40.0 mg/d. Additional improvements occurred among 14 of 34 patients (41%) who received immunotherapy (intravenous immune globulin, azathioprine, prednisone, mycophenolate mofetil, or cyclophosphamide). Sixteen of 25 patients (64%) with extended follow-up duration remained ambulatory.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Recognition of classic SMS vs variants is important because appropriate therapy improves symptoms in most patients. Classification by anatomical extent and by GAD65 antibody serostatus gives important diagnostic and prognostic information.","{'GARD:0003129', 'GARD:0010775', 'GARD:0013110', 'GARD:0009890', 'GARD:0002714'}","{'classic form', 'hodgkin lymphoma', 'autoimmune disease', 'stiff-man syndrome', 'progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus'}",{'incidence'},"{'25 %', '41 %', '64 %', '4 %', 'sixty - seven percent', '15 %'}","{'rochester', 'minnesota'}"
"Ataxia-telangiectasia is the second most common autosomal recessive hereditary ataxia, with an estimated incidence of 1 in 100,000 births. Besides ataxia and ocular telangiectasias, eye movement abnormalities have long been associated with this disorder and is frequently present in almost all patients. A handful of studies have described the phenomenology of ocular motor deficits in ataxia-telangiectasia. Contemporary literature linked their physiology to cerebellar dysfunction and secondary abnormalities at the level of brainstem. These studies, while providing a proof of concept of ocular motor physiology in disease, i.e., ataxia-telangiectasia, also advanced our understanding of how the cerebellum works. Here, we will summarize the clinical abnormalities seen with ataxia-telangiectasia in each subtype of eye movements and subsequently describe the underlying pathophysiology. Finally, we will review how these deficits are linked to abnormal cerebellar function and how it allows better understanding of the cerebellar physiology.","{'GARD:0013686', 'GARD:0006614'}","{'hereditary ataxia', 'autosomal recessive'}",{'incidence'},set(),set()
"<h4>Objective</h4>To determine the prevalence of Barth syndrome in the pediatric population.<h4>Study design</h4>Data were collected from the Barth Syndrome Foundation Registry and relevant literature. With the advent of genetic testing and whole-exome sequencing, a multipronged Bayesian analysis was used to estimate the prevalence of Barth syndrome based on published data on the incidence and prevalence of cardiomyopathy and neutropenia, and the respective subpopulations of patients with Barth syndrome indicated in these publications.<h4>Results</h4>Based on 7 published studies of cardiomyopathy and 2 published studies of neutropenia, the estimated prevalence of Barth syndrome is approximately 1 case per million male population. This contrasts with 99 cases in the Barth Syndrome Foundation Registry, 58 of which indicate a US location, and only 230-250 cases known worldwide.<h4>Conclusions</h4>It appears that Barth syndrome is greatly underdiagnosed. There is a need for better education and awareness of this rare disease to move toward early diagnosis and treatment.",{'GARD:0005890'},{'barth syndrome'},"{'incidence', 'prevalence'}",{'1 case per million male'},"{'us', 'worldwide'}"
"Previous research has demonstrated a high prevalence of <i>Coxiella burnetii</i> in the bulk tank milk on large industrial dairy farms of the central and eastern European region. The aim of this survey was to estimate the prevalence of specific IgG antibodies to <i>C. burnetii</i> proving previous infection among dairy farm workers and to determine the possible risk factors. Serum samples from veterinarians, inseminators, animal caretakers, milking parlor workers, and herd managers working on dairy farms were tested for the presence of IgG to phase I and phase II of <i>C. burnetii</i> using an indirect microimmunofluorescence assay. Antibodies phase II to <i>C. burnetii</i> were detected in 59 out of 70 individuals tested (84.3%). All occupational groups are highly exposed to <i>C. burnetii</i> infection. Veterinarians, inseminators, and animal caretakers had 100% seropositivity rate of phase II, whereas the seropositivity rate found among herd managers and milking parlor workers was 71.4% and 47%, respectively. The findings of this survey suggest that the risk of <i>C. burnetii</i> infection is correlated with cattle density in the large dairy farms and also with occupational groups.",set(),set(),{'prevalence'},"{'100 %', '84 . 3 %', '71 . 4 %', '47 %'}",set()
"Neonatal herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection is rare, with an estimated incidence of 3.58 per 100 000 live births in the UK and should be suspected in any newborn with fever and bacterial culture-negative sepsis. We describe a case of a previously well full-term male neonate who presented with persistent fever and elevated ferritin level that was carried out during the era of the COVID-19 pandemic as part of SARS-CoV-2 panel investigations. Despite the initial negative HSV serology, HSV-1 PCR from a scalp lesion returned positive. He made a full recovery after acyclovir therapy. This case highlights the importance of maintaining a high clinical index of suspicion of HSV infection in any febrile neonate even with absence of maternal history and negative serology, particularly if associated with hyperferritinaemia. We also address the challenge of interpreting inflammatory biomarkers' results for SARS-CoV-2 infection in neonates.","{'GARD:0007173', 'GARD:0008707'}","{'absence of', 'neonatal herpes'}",{'incidence'},{'3 . 58 per 100 000'},{'uk'}
"Diabetes is a chronic illness. Hyperglycemia is the characteristic of this disorder. Diabetes is a global crisis which affects the economy and health of all nations. Over the last decades, the number of individuals living with diabetes has significantly increased worldwide. Asia is a key epicenter of the emerging diabetes epidemic, with China and India the two nations having the highest number of diabetic people. Economic development, modernization, unhealthy diet, population aging, and sedentary lifestyles are the major factors responsible for the increasing diabetes epidemic. Diabetes is associated with several complications, and cardiovascular disease is the most important cause of morbidity and mortality among people with diabetes. These life-threatening problems can be prevented or delayed by proper management of diabetes. Lifestyle modification is an important factor to decrease the diabetes risk. The frequency of diabetic complications will rise if there is a lack of cost-effective and sustainable interventions. Hence, prevention of diabetes and its complications such as diabetic retinopathy and cardiovascular disease should be a crucial part of all future health-related public policies among all nations.

"<h4>Background/aim</h4>This study analysed the prevalence of the characteristics evaluated in dermatoscopy for melanocytic infiltrations of the conjunctiva with various degrees of malignancy.<h4>Patients and methods</h4>A total of 160 conjunctival pigmented lesions were studied. Each lesion was scored using dermatoscopic patterns and the characteristics of malignancy described by Kittler. Also, the Authors' own clues were added to the evaluation.<h4>Results</h4>In melanomas, the following characteristics were identified: asymmetry of the pattern and colour, larger average number of colours, the presence of grey colour, structureless area, polymorphic vessels and feeder vessels. A pattern of black dots and a black colour was typical of malignant lesions and pre-cancerous (premalignant) lesions - primary acquired melanosis (PAM) with atypia. Cysts were observed only in the group of naevi.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The patterns evaluated with dermatoscopy are present in pigmented lesions of the conjunctiva. There are, however, some characteristics which allow differentiation between melanoma and pigmented naevus and melanosis and also between PAM.",set(),set(),{'prevalence'},set(),set()
"<h4>Purpose</h4>Our goal was to assess the prevalence of ipsilateral distal femoral osteochondritis dissecans (OCD)-like lesions in children with Blount disease, including factors associated with this finding.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Characteristics of patients with an OCD-like lesion on an imaging study [(X-ray and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)] were compared with those without such a finding.<h4>Results</h4>Over a 12-year period, 6/63 (10%) skeletally immature patients (9/87 limbs) with Blount disease had an OCD-like lesion visible on plain radiographs. Based on available MRI, 7/37 (19%) patients or 10/53 (19%) limbs had an OCD-like distal femoral lesion. All lesions were noted in the posterior third of the weight-bearing portion of the medial femoral condyle with intact overlying articular cartilage. All patients with OCD-like lesions were followed for an average of 1.9 years (range: 1-2.6 years), and complete radiographic resolution of lesion was noted in 7/9 limbs (78%). There was no association of the presence of OCD-like lesion with early- vs late-onset disease, gender, age at imaging, laterality, magnitude of deformity [mean mechanical axis deviation (MAD) 63.3 vs 71.9 mm], mean mechanical lateral distal femoral angle (mLDFA; 91.3 vs 89.7°), and mean medial proximal tibial angle (MPTA; 71.7 vs 71.8°). Children with an OCD-like lesion tended to have a lower mean body mass index (BMI; 21 vs 36, <i>p</i> = 0.003).<h4>Conclusion</h4>The overall prevalence of OCD-like lesions in the medial femoral condyle in children with Blount disease lesions is 10% using plain radiographs and at least 19% on MRI. Based on the numbers available, we were unable to demonstrate any associations between the presence of such lesions and the patient's age, gender, or magnitude of varus deformity. Further research is needed to fully ascertain the aetiology and natural history of these benign appearing osteochondral imaging findings in children with Blount disease. Our current data support that these lesions do resolve with time and that no surgical intervention targeted at the femoral OCD-like lesion is warranted.<h4>Level of evidence</h4>Diagnostic study Level III.<h4>How to cite this article</h4>Edobor-Osula F, Wenokor C, Bloom T, <i>et al.</i> Ipsilateral Osteochondritis Dissecans-like Distal Femoral Lesions in Children with Blount Disease: Prevalence and Associated Findings.

"Childhood wasting is among the most prevalent forms of undernutrition globally. The Southeast Asia region is home to many wasted children, but wasting is not recognized as a public health problem and its epidemiology is yet to be fully examined. This analysis aimed to determine the burden of wasting, its predictors, and the level of wasting and stunting concurrence. Datasets from Demographic and Health Surveys and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys in six countries in the region were analyzed. The pooled weighted prevalence for wasting and concurrent wasting and stunting among children 0-59 months in the six countries was 8.9%, 95% CI (8.0-9.9) and 1.6%, 95% CI (1.5-1.8), respectively. This prevalence is approximately 12-fold higher than the 0.7% prevalence of high-income countries; and translated into an absolute number of 1,088,747 children affected by wasting and 272,563 concurrent wasting and stunting. Wasting prevalence was 50 percent higher in the 0-23-month age group. Predictors for wasting included source of drinking water, wealth index, urban residence, child's age and history of illness and mother's body mass index. In conclusion, our analysis showed that wasting is a serious public health problem in the region that should be addressed urgently using both preventive and curative approaches.",set(),set(),{'prevalence'},"{'0 . 7 %', '50 percent', '1 . 6 %', '8 . 9 %'}",{'southeast asia'}
"Congenital adrenal hyperplasia is the most common cause of ambiguous genitalia worldwide, with an incidence of 1 in 15,000 live births. The most frequently-occurring subtype, 21-hydroxylase deficiency, results in diminished production of aldosterone and cortisol as well as increased androgen secretion. Previous studies have reported a relationship between ovarian cyst formation and adrenal androgen excess; nevertheless, neonatal large ovarian cysts have rarely been reported in newborns with congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Herein, we present the unique case of a neonate with classical 21-hydroxylase deficiency who underwent surgery for a huge unilateral solitary ovarian follicular cyst on the seventh postnatal day. Possible mechanisms by which androgen excess may cause ovarian cyst formation are also discussed.","{'GARD:0005757', 'GARD:0000247', 'GARD:0001467'}","{'21-hydroxylase deficiency', 'congenital adrenal hyperplasia', 'ambiguous genitalia'}",{'incidence'},set(),{'worldwide'}
"<h4>Background</h4>Many studies reported high prevalence of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) in patients with COVID-19 raising questions about its true prevalence and its clinical impact on the disease course.<h4>Methods</h4>We conducted a meta-analysis and a systematic review to examine the prevalence of aPL and its clinical impact in patients with COVID-19.<h4>Results</h4>21 studies with a total of 1159 patients were included in our meta-analysis. Among patients hospitalised with COVID-19, the pooled prevalence rate of one or more aPL (IgM or IgG or IgA of anticardiolipin (aCL) or anti-ß2 glycoprotein (anti-ß2 GPI) or antiphosphatidylserine/prothrombin, or lupus anticoagulant (LA)) was 46.8% (95% CI 36.1% to 57.8%). The most frequent type of aPL found was LA, with pooled prevalence rate of 50.7% (95% CI 34.8% to 66.5%). Critically ill patients with COVID-19 had significantly higher prevalence of aCL (IgM or IgG) (28.8% vs 7.10%, p<0.0001) and anti-ß2 GPI (IgM or IgG) (12.0% vs 5.8%, p<0.0001) as compared with non-critically ill patients. However, there was no association between aPL positivity and mean levels of C reactive protein (mean difference was 32 (95% CI -15 to 79), p=0.18), D-dimer (mean difference was 34 (95% CI -194 to 273), p=0.77), mortality (1.46 (95% CI 0.29 to 7.29), p=0.65), invasive ventilation (1.22 (95% CI 0.51 to 2.91), p=0.65) and venous thromboembolism (1.38 (95% CI 0.57 to 3.37), p=0.48).<h4>Conclusions</h4>aPLs were detected in nearly half of patients with COVID-19, and higher prevalence of aPL was found in severe disease. However, there was no association between aPL positivity and disease outcomes including thrombosis, invasive ventilation and mortality.

"BACKGROUND:The aim of this study was to assess the incidence of fractures in infancy, overall and by type of fracture, its association with accidents, metabolic bone disease risk factors, and abuse diagnosis. METHODS:The design was a population-based register study in Sweden. Participants: Children born 1997-2014, 0-1 years of age diagnosed with fracture-diagnosis according to International Classification of Diseases (ICD10) were retrieved from the National Patient Register and linked to the Swedish Medical Birth Register and the Death Cause Register. Main outcome measures were fractures of the skull, long bone, clavicle and ribs, categorized by age (younger or older than 6 months), and accident or not. FINDINGS:The incidence of fractures during infancy was 251 per 100 000 infants (n = 4663). Major fracture localisations were long bone (44·9%), skull (31·7%), and clavicle (18·6%), while rib fractures were few (1·4%). Fall accidents were reported among 71·4%. One-third occurred during the first 6 months. Metabolic bone disease risk factors, such as maternal obesity, preterm birth, vitamin D deficiency, rickets, and calcium metabolic disturbances, had increased odds of fractures of long bones and ribs in early infancy (0-6 months): birth 32-36 weeks and long bone fracture [AOR 2·13 (95%CI 1·67-2·93)] and rib fracture [AOR 4·24 (95%CI 1·40-12·8)]. Diagnosis of vitamin D deficiency/rickets/disorders of calcium metabolism had increased odds of long bone fracture [AOR 49·5 (95%CI 18·3-134)] and rib fracture [AOR 617 (95%CI 162-2506)]. Fractures without a reported accident had higher odds of metabolic risk factors than those with reported accidents. Abuse diagnosis was registered in 105 infants, with overrepresentation of preterm births, multiple births and small-for-gestational age. INTERPRETATION:Metabolic bone disease risk factors are strongly associated with fractures of long bone and ribs in early infancy.

": The Bernard-Soulier syndrome (BSS) is a rare disease with a prevalence of 1/1000 000; it is characterized by macrothrombocytopenia. BSS develops as a result of a defect in the glycoprotein GPIb-IX-V complex on the platelet surface. In this article, we present a pediatric patient with the novel mutation that has been identified for the first time in BSS. A 13-month-old male patient was admitted with severe thrombocytopenia unresponsive to intravenous immunoglobulin in the neonatal period and recurrent mucocutaneous bleeding which initiated at 5 months of age. glycoprotein (GP) IX (CD42a) expression was normal as per flow cytometry results. Genetic analysis revealed a homozygous c.243C>A (p.Cys81) (p.C81) mutation. This novel mutation identified by us presents with severe thrombocytopenia and normal GPIX (CD42a) expression and is mistaken for immune thrombocytopenia in the neonatal period. This mutation creates an early stop codon and possibly leads to loss of function of the receptor.","{'GARD:0002470', 'GARD:0006768'}","{'bernard-soulier syndrome', 'immune thrombocytopenia'}",{'prevalence'},{'1 / 1000'},{'us'}
"<h4>Objective</h4>To assess the prevalence and patterns of hypodontia in nonsyndromic Pierre Robin sequence (PRS) and compare it with hypodontia in nonsyndromic isolated cleft palates and isolated cleft lips.<h4>Design</h4>Retrospective cohort study.<h4>Setting</h4>Alder Hey Children's Hospital, United Kingdom.<h4>Patients</h4>Patients with nonsyndromic PRS (group 1), isolated cleft palate (group 2), and isolated cleft lip (group 3).<h4>Main outcome measures</h4>Hypodontia in the permanent dentition assessed from orthopantomographs.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 154 patients were included. Group 1 had the highest incidence of hypodontia with 47% having at least one tooth congenitally absent. Groups 2 and 3 had reduced rates of hypodontia with 27% and 19% of the groups missing teeth, respectively; 93% of cases of hypodontia in group 1 involved the absence of at least one second premolar. Of these patients, there was found to be bilateral agenesis of second premolars in 50% of cases.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Patients with PRS and cleft palates are more likely to have hypodontia than those with isolated cleft palates or unilateral cleft lips. Patients with PRS have more severe hypodontia than those with isolated cleft palates or unilateral cleft lips.

"This study is to describe current incidence of childhood clear cell sarcoma of kidney (CCSK) and to investigate the present survival of this cancer. Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Result (SEER) data was used to identify children with CCSK and Wilms tumor (WT) aged 0-19 years in the US. Age-adjusted incidences were estimated over the decades. Age- and sex-specific epidemiology was also presented. Propensity score matching was used to balance features of CCSK and WT cases. Log rank test was used to compare survivals and Cox regression was used to evaluate independent effects of factors. The present age-adjusted incidence of childhood CCSK was 0.205 per million, which remained stable for years and ranked third in all pediatric renal tumors. The incidence rate ratios for boy and age under 4 were 3 and 21, respectively. The current 5-year overall survival (OS) rate for CCSK was 87%, which is not evidently inferior to that for WT (90%); however the outcome of CCSK was significantly poorer if both groups were well-balanced (OS rate was 86 vs. 95%). Early year of diagnosis and distant metastasis were independent survival factors. In conclusion, occurrence of CCSK remains stable over the years, with an age-adjusted incidence of 0.205 per million. Boy and age under 4 are risk factors for tumor development. CCSK currently has a favorable outcome but its nature may be more aggressive than common kidney tumor, which in turn proves efficacy of modern treatment.","{'GARD:0005576', 'GARD:0009184'}","{'wilms tumor', 'of childhood'}","{'occurrence', 'incidence'}","{'90 %', '0 . 205 per million ,', '0 . 205 per million', '86 vs . 95 %', '87 %'}",{'us'}

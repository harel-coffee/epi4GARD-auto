( O

, O
which O
are O
among O
the O
most O
common O
genetic O
diseases O
in O

, O
define O
a O
clinically O

genetically O
heterogeneous O
group O
of O
disorders O
. O

Over O
80 O
forms O
of O
syndromic O
IRDs O
have O
been O
described O
. O

Approximately O
200 O
genes O
are O
associated O
with O
these O
syndromes O
. O

The O
majority O
of O
syndromic O
IRDs O
are O
recessively O
inherited O
and O
rare O
. O

Many O
, O
although O
not O
all O
, O
syndromic O
IRDs O
can O
be O
classified O
into O
one O
of O
two O
major O
disease O
groups O
: O
inborn O
errors O
of O

ciliopathies O
. O

Besides O
the O
retina O
, O
the O
systems O
and O
organs O
most O
commonly O
involved O
in O
syndromic O
IRDs O
are O
the O
central O

ophthalmic O
extra O
- O
retinal O
tissues O
, O
ear O
, O

, O
kidney O
and O
the O

. O

Due O
to O
the O
high O
degree O
of O
phenotypic O
variability O
and O
phenotypic O
overlap O
found O
in O
syndromic O
IRDs O
, O
correct O
diagnosis O
based O
on O
phenotypic O
features O
alone O
may O
be O
challenging O
and O
sometimes O
misleading O
. O

Therefore O
, O
genetic O
testing O
has O
become O
the O
benchmark O
for O
the O
diagnosis O
and O
management O
of O
patients O

Abstract O
. O

Wilson O
's O
disease O
, O
or O
hepatolenticular O
degeneration O
, O
is O
a O
rare O
inherited O
disorder O
of O
copper O
metabolism O
. O

The O
most O
common O
clinical O
presentations O
are O
liver O
disease O
and O
/ O
or O
neuro O
- O
psychiatric O
manifestations O
. O

Pathophysiologically O
, O
Wilson O
's O
disease O
is O
caused O
by O
mutations O
in O
the O
ATP7B O
gene O
, O
which O
lead O
to O
defective O
biliary O
excretion O
of O
copper O
and O
subsequent O
accumulation O
of O
copper O
in O
the O
liver O
and O
in O
other O
organs O
. O

Its O
prevalence B-EPI
is O
approximately B-STAT
1:30 I-STAT
000 I-STAT
, I-STAT
however O
its O
penetrance O
, O
clinical O
presentation O
and O
disease O
severity O
vary O
widely O
, O
ranging O
from O
asymptomatic O
elevation O
of O
liver O
enzymes O
to O
cirrhosis O
or O
acute O
liver O
failure O
with O
or O
without O
neuro O
- O
psychiatric O
symptoms O
. O

For O
this O
reason O
, O
Wilson O
's O
disease O
should O
be O
suspected O
and O
ruled O
out O
in O
cases O
of O
indeterminate O
liver O
disease O
or O
neuropsychiatric O
disturbances O
. O

The O
diagnostic O
algorithms O
are O
complex O

of O
Wilson O

disease O
by O

is O
usually O
effective O

In O
case O
of O

may O
be O
needed O

We O
conclude O
that O
although O
approximately O
two O

COVID-19 O
( O
coronavirus O
disease O
2019 O
) O
represents O
a O
prothrombotic O
disorder O
, O
and O
there O
have O
been O
several O
reports O
of O
platelet O
factor O
4 O
/ O
heparin O
antibodies O
being O
present O
in O
COVID-19 O
- O
infected O
patients O
. O

This O
has O
thus O
been O
identified O
in O
some O
publications O
as O
representing O
a O
high O
incidence B-EPI
of O
heparin O
- O
induced O
thrombocytopenia O
( O
HIT O
) O
, O
whereas O
in O
others O
, O
findings O
have O
been O
tempered O
by O
general O
lack O
of O
functional O
reactivity O
using O
confirmation O
assays O
of O
serotonin O

assay O
( O
SRA O
) O
or O
heparin O
- O
induced O
platelet O
aggregation O
( O
HIPA O
) O
. O

Moreover O
, O
in O
at O
least O
two O
publications O
, O
data O
are O
provided O
suggesting O
that O
antibodies O
can O
arise O
in O
heparin O
naïve O
patients O
or O
that O
platelet O
activation O
may O
not O
be O
heparin O
- O
dependent O
. O

From O
this O
literature O
, O
we O
would O
conclude O
that O
platelet O
factor O
4 O
/ O
heparin O
antibodies O
can O
be O
observed O
in O
COVID-19 O
- O
infected O
patients O
, O
and O
they O
may O
occur O
at O
higher O
incidence B-EPI
than O
in O
historical O
non O
- O
COVID-19 O
- O
infected O
cohorts O
. O

However O
, O
the O
situation O
is O
complex O
, O
since O
not O
all O
platelet O
factor O
4 O
/ O
heparin O
antibodies O
may O
lead O
to O
platelet O
activation O
, O
and O
not O
all O
identified O
antibodies O
are O
heparin O
- O
dependent O
, O
such O
that O
they O
do O
not O
necessarily O
reflect O
 O
true O
 O
HIT O
. O

Most O
recently O
, O
a O
 O
HIT O
- O
like O
 O
syndrome O
has O
reported O
in O
patients O
who O
have O
been O
vaccinated O
against O
COVID-19 O
. O

Accordingly O
, O
much O
more O
is O
yet O
to O
be O
learnt O
about O
the O
insidious O
disease O
that O
COVID-19 O
represents O
, O
including O
autoimmune O
outcomes O
in O

patients O

Clinical O

A O
literature O
survey O
of O
15 O

points O
to O
certain O

Gastrointestinal O

: O
vitelline O

The O
cause O

is O
unknown O
, O
but O
there O
are O
some O
possible O
factors O
such O
as O
age O
younger O

The O

Some O
of O
these O

the O

These O
issues O
have O

Because O

Therefore O

BACKGROUND O
: O
Balanced O

are O
the O
ones O
of O
the O
most O
common O
structural O

in O

, O
with O
an O
incidence B-EPI
of O
1:625 O

do O
not O
demonstrate O
changes O
in O

, O
except O
when O
the O

. O

However O
, O
these O
people O
are O
at O
risk O
of O
production O
of O

gametes O
during O
meiosis O
, O
as O
a O
result O
of O
various O

, O
such O
as O

Therefore O
, O
classical O

and O
the O

Since O

( O

We O

The O

attributed O
to O
many O
factors O

the O

the O

The O
disease O

Congenital O
Hepatic O
Fibrosis O
is O
an O
autosomal O

to O
mutation O
in O
the O
PKHD1 O
gene O

which O
encodes O
the O
fibrocystin O

, O
characterized O
by O
varying O
degrees O
of O
periportal O
fibrosis O
and O
irregular O
proliferation O
of O
bile O

. O

Affected O
patients O
are O
typically O
diagnosed O
in O
childhood O
, O
but O
in O
some O
cases O
the O
disease O
may O
remain O
asymptomatic O
for O
many O
years O
. O

The O
exact O
prevalence B-EPI
and O
incidence B-EPI
of O
the O
disease O
are O
not O
known O
, O
but O
it O
is O
consider O
a O
rare O
disease O
, O
with O
a O
few O

It O
can O
affect O
all O
ethnic O
groups O
and O
occur O
associated O
with O
various O
hereditary O
and O
non O
- O
hereditary O
disorders O
. O

The O
clinical O
presentation O
is O
quite O
variable O
, O
with O
melena O
and O
hematemesis O
being O
initial O
symptoms O
in O
30%-70 O
% O
of O
the O
cases O
. O

More O
rarely O
, O
they O
may O
present O
episodes O

The O
disease O
has O
been O
classified O
into O
four O
types O
: O
portal O
hypertension O
, O
cholestasis O
/ O
cholangitis O
, O
mixed O
and O
latent O
. O

Diagnosis O
begins O
with O
imaging O
tests O
, O
but O
the O
definition O
is O
made O
by O
the O
histopathological O
sample O

So O

, O
there O
is O
no O
specific O
therapy O
that O
can O
stop O
or O
reverse O
the O
pathological O
process O
. O

Currently O
, O
the O
therapeutic O
strategy O
is O
to O
treat O
the O
complications O
of O
the O
disease O
. O

Impetigo O
is O
a O
common O
superficial O
bacterial O
infection O
of O
the O
skin O
, O
with O
a O
global O
disease O
burden O
of O
greater O
than O
140 O
million O
. O

Children O
are O
more O
affected O
than O
adults O
and O
incidence B-EPI
decreases O
with O
age O
. O

Principal O
pathogens O
implicated O
include O
Staphylococcus O

and O
Streptococcus O
pyogenes O
. O

There O
are O
two O
common O
variants O
of O
impetigo O
: O
nonbullous O
( O
70 O
% O
) O
and O
bullous O
( O
30 O

Treatment O
for O

is O
recommended O
for O
extensive O
cases O

Bubonic O

even O
though O
it O
represents O
the O
temporal O
, O
geographical O
and O
phylogenetic O
transition O
between O
the O
second O
and O
third O
pandemics O
. O

Here O
we O
analysed O
in O
detail O
an O
outbreak O
of O
plague O
that O
took O
place O
in O
Cairo B-LOC
in O
1801 O
, O
and O
for O
which O
epidemiological O
data O
are O
uniquely O
available O
thanks O
to O
the O
presence O
of O
medical O
officers O
accompanying O
the O
Napoleonic O
expedition O
into O
Egypt B-LOC
at O
that O
time O
. O

We O
propose O
a O
new O
stochastic O
model O
describing O
how O
bubonic O
plague O
outbreaks O
unfold O
in O
both O
rat O
and O
human O
populations O
, O
and O
perform O
Bayesian O
inference O
under O
this O
model O
using O
a O
particle O
Markov O
chain O
Monte O

. O

Rat O
carcasses O
were O
estimated O
to O
be O
infectious O
for O
approximately O
4 O
days O
after O
death O
, O
which O
is O
in O
good O
agreement O
with O
local O
observations O
on O
the O
survival O
of O
infectious O
rat O

. O

The O
estimated O
transmission O
rate O
between O
rats O
implies O
a O
basic O
reproduction O
number O
R O
0 O
of O
approximately O
3 O
, O
causing O
the O
collapse O
of O
the O
rat O
population O
in O
approximately O
100 O
days O
. O

Simultaneously O
, O
the O
force O
of O
infection O
exerted O
by O
each O
infected O
rat O
carcass O
onto O
the O
human O
population O
increases O
progressively O
by O
more O
than O
an O
order O
of O

. O

We O
also O
considered O
human O

human O
transmission O
via O
pneumonic O

or O
human O
specific O
vectors O
, O
but O
found O
this O
route O
to O
account O
for O
only O
a O
small O
fraction O

Conclusions O
The O
study O

revealed O
that O
although O
the O

Anaphylaxis O
is O
a O
severe O
allergic O
reaction O
, O
rapid O
in O
onset O
, O
and O
can O
lead O
to O
fatal O
consequences O
if O
not O
promptly O
treated O
. O

The O
incidence B-EPI
of O
anaphylaxis O
has O
risen O
at O
an O
alarming O
rate O
in O
past O
decades O
and O
continues O
to O
rise O
. O

Therefore O
, O
there O
is O
a O
general O
interest O
in O
understanding O
the O
molecular O
mechanism O
that O
leads O
to O
an O
exacerbated O
response O
. O

The O
main O
effector O
cells O
are O
mast O
cells O
, O
commonly O
triggered O
by O
stimuli O
that O
involve O
the O
IgE O
- O
dependent O
or O
IgE O
- O
independent O
pathway O
. O

These O
signaling O
pathways O
converge O
in O
the O
release O
of O
proinflammatory O
mediators O
, O
such O
as O
histamine O
, O
tryptases O
, O
prostaglandins O
, O
etc O
. O
, O
in O
minutes O
. O

The O
action O
and O
cell O
targets O
of O
these O
proinflammatory O
mediators O
are O
linked O
to O
the O
pathophysiologic O
consequences O
observed O
in O
this O
severe O
allergic O
reaction O
. O

While O
many O
molecules O
are O
involved O
in O
cellular O
regulation O
, O
the O
expression O
and O
regulation O
of O
transcription O
factors O
involved O
in O
the O
synthesis O
of O
proinflammatory O
mediators O
and O
secretory O
granule O
homeostasis O
are O
of O
special O
interest O
, O
due O
to O
their O
ability O
to O
control O
gene O
expression O
and O
change O
phenotype O
, O
and O
they O
may O
be O
key O
in O
the O
severity O
of O
the O
entire O
reaction O
. O

In O
this O
review O
, O
we O
will O
describe O
our O
current O
understanding O
of O
the O
pathophysiology O
of O
human O
anaphylaxis O
, O
focusing O
on O
the O
transcription O

, O
or O
deregulation O
of O
their O

, O
will O
be O
updated O
. O

So O
far O
, O
the O
risk O
of O
anaphylaxis O
is O
unpredictable O
thus O
, O
increasing O
our O
knowledge O
of O
the O
molecular O
mechanism O
that O
leads O
and O
regulates O
mast O
cell O
activity O
will O
enable O
us O
to O
improve O

can O
be O
prevented O

Furthermore O
, O
we O
review O
the O
combination O
of O

, O
natural O

and O

suggesting O
that O

We O

Most O
of O
the O

due O
to O
detection O
of O

the O

Interestingly O
, O

Collectively O

The O

The O

These O
anomalies O
can O
cause O

However O
, O
the O
pathogenesis O

CAKUT O
is O
not O
well O
understood O
, O
because O
identifying O
the O

difficult O
due O
to O
the O
phenotypic O

We O
describe O
the O

In O

We O
report O
a O

a O
10 O

old O
child O
with O
DS O
who O
presented O
with O
a O
medulloblastoma O
( O

. O

Histological O
examination O
revealed O
a O
classic O
MB O
with O
focal O

and O
the O
molecular O

showed O
the O
presence O

a O

variant O
associated O

the O
wingless O
( O

good O
prognosis O
in O
contrast O
to O
our O
case O

that O

relapse O
. O

The O
nearly O
seven O
- O
fold O
decreased O
risk O
of O
MB O
in O
children O
with O
DS O
suggests O
the O
presence O
of O

mechanisms O
. O

The O
cerebellum O

and O
the O
reduced O

seem O
to O
be O
a O
possible O
favorable O
condition O

Moreover O
, O
the O
NOTCH O

WNT O
dysregulation O
in O
DS O
, O
which O
is O
probably O
associated O
with O
an O
increased O

, O
suggests O
a O
pivotal O
role O
of O
this O
pathway O
alteration O
in O
the O
pathogenesis O
of O
MB O
; O
therefore O
, O
this O
condition O
should O
be O
further O
investigated O
in O
future O
studies O
by O
molecular O
characterizations O
. O

The O
end O
- O
of O
- O
outbreak O
declaration O
is O
an O
important O
step O
in O
controlling O
infectious O
disease O
outbreaks O
. O

Objective O
estimation O
of O
the O
confidence O
level O
that O
an O
outbreak O
is O
over O
is O
important O
to O
reduce O
the O
risk O
of O
postdeclaration O
flare O
- O
ups O
. O

We O
developed O
a O
simulation O
- O
based O
model O
with O
which O
to O
quantify O
that O
confidence O
and O
tested O
it O
on O
simulated O
Ebola O
virus O
disease O
data O
. O

We O
found O
that O
these O
confidence O
estimates O
were O
most O
sensitive O
to O
the O
instantaneous O
reproduction O
number O
, O
the O
reporting O
rate O
, O
and O
the O
time O
between O
the O
symptom O
onset O
and O
death O
or O
recovery O
of O
the O
last O
detected O
case O
. O

For O
Ebola O
virus O
disease O
, O
our O
results O
suggested O
that O
the O
current O
World O
Health O
Organization O
criterion O
of O
42 O
days O
since O
the O
recovery O
or O
death O
of O
the O
last O
detected O
case O
is O
too O
short O
and O
too O
sensitive O
to O
underreporting O
. O

Therefore O
, O
we O
suggest O
a O
shift O
to O
a O
preliminary O
end O
- O
of O
- O
outbreak O
declaration O
after O
63 O
days O
from O
the O
symptom O
onset O
day O
of O
the O
last O
detected O
case O
. O

This O
preliminary O
declaration O
should O
still O
be O
followed O
by O
90 O
days O
of O
enhanced O
surveillance O
to O
capture O
potential O
flare O
- O
ups O
of O
cases O
, O
after O
which O
the O
official O
end O
of O
the O
outbreak O
can O
be O
declared O
. O

This O
sequence O
corresponds B-STAT
to I-STAT
more I-STAT
than O
95 O
% O
confidence O
that O
an O
outbreak O
is O
over O
in O
most O
of O

examined O
. O

Our O

could O
be O

To O

We O

Conclusion O
It O
is O

Adrenocortical O
carcinoma O
( O

is O
a O
rare O
endocrine O
malignancy O
arising O

It O
can O

of O
incidence B-EPI
: O
in O
the O
first O
and O
between O

of O
life O
. O

Although O
ACC O
are O
mostly O
hormonally O
active O
, O
precursors O
and O
metabolites O
, O
rather O
than O
end O
products O
of O
steroidogenesis O
are O
produced O
by O
dedifferentiated O
and O
immature O
malignant O

Distinguishing O

, O
between O

, O
which O
are O
quite O
frequent O
in O
general O
population O
, O
and O
malignant O
carcinomas O
with O
dismal O
prognosis O
is O
often O
unfeasible O
. O

Even O
after O
pathohistological O
analysis O
, O
diagnosis O
of O
adrenocortical O
carcinomas O
is O
not O
always O
straightforward O
and O
represents O
a O
great O
challenge O
for O
experienced O
and O
multidisciplinary O
expert O
teams O
. O

No O
single O
imaging O
method O
, O
hormonal O
work O

up O
or O
immunohistochemical O

can O
definitively O
prove O
the O

Over O
several O

' O
great O
efforts O
have O
been O
made O
in O

Despite O
these O
achievements O
, O
the O
5 O

mortality O
rate O
still O
accounts O
for O
approximately O
75 O
% O

% O
, O
ACC O
is O
frequently O
diagnosed O
in O
advanced O
stages O
and O
therapeutic O
options O
are O
unfortunately O
limited O
. O

Therefore O
, O
imperative O
is O
to O
identify O
new O
biological O
markers O
that O
can O
predict O

The O

found O
that O

From O

we O
infer O
several O

We O
found O
that O

is O
a O
group O

of O
the O

CMT O
is O
subdivided O
into O
two O
main O

: O
a O
demyelinating O
form O
, O
known O
as O
CMT1 O
, O
and O
an O
axonal O
form O
, O
known O
as O
CMT2 O
. O

Nearly O
30 O
genes O
have O
been O
identified O
as O
a O
cause O
of O
CMT2 O
. O

One O
of O
these O
is O
the O
' O

E1 O
and O
transketolase O
domain O
containing O

( O
DHTKD1 O

gene O

We O

of O
the O

The O
aim O
of O
the O
current O
study O
was O
to O
investigate O
whether O
human O
disease O
- O
causing O
mutations O
in O
the O
Dhtkd1 O
gene O
cause O
CMT2Q O

in O
a O

to O
investigate O
the O
physiological O

and O
pathogenic O
mechanisms O
associated O
with O

in O
the O
Dhtkd1 O
gene O
in O

. O

Therefore O
, O
we O
generated O
a O
knock O

in O
mouse O
model O
with O
the O
Dhtkd1 O
Y486 O

We O
observed O
that O
the O
Dhtkd1 O
expression O
level O
in O
sciatic O
nerve O
of O
knock O
- O
in O
mice O
was O
significantly O
lower O
than O
in O
wild O
- O
type O
mice O
. O

Moreover O
, O
a O
histopathological O
phenotype O
was O
observed O
, O
reminiscent O
of O
a O
peripheral O
neuropathy O
, O
including O
reduced O
large O
axon O
diameter O
and O
abnormal O
myelination O
in O
peripheral O
nerves O
. O

The O
knock O
- O
in O
mice O
also O
displayed O
clear O
sensory O
defects O
, O
while O
no O
abnormalities O
in O
the O
motor O
performance O
were O
observed O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
accumulation O
of O
mitochondria O
and O
an O
elevated O
energy O
metabolic O
state O
was O
observed O
in O
the O
knock O
- O
in O
mice O
. O

Taken O
together O
, O
our O
study O
indicates O
that O
the O
Dhtkd1 O
Y486 O
* O
knock O
- O
in O
mice O
partially O
recapitulate O
the O
clinical O
phenotypes O
of O
CMT2Q O
patients O
and O
we O
hypothesize O
that O
there O
might O
be O
a O
compensatory O
effect O
from O
the O
elevated O
metabolic O
state O
in O
the O
knock O

in O

that O
enables O
them O

maintain O
their O
normal O

Sjögren O

( O
SS O
) O
is O
a O
common O

SS O
usually O
occurs B-EPI

Kidney O

is O
relatively O
uncommon O
in O
SS O
, O
which O
is O
mostly O
characterized O
as O

may O
result O
in O

Case O

: O
A O
73 O
- O
year O
- O
old O
woman O
had O
a O
small O
intestinal O
nonfunctional O
NET O
with O
liver O

. O

After O
uncontrollable O
liver O
metastasis O
at O
the O
advanced O
stage O
, O
she O
developed O
duodenal O

with O

. O

The O
patient O
was O
treated O
with O
octreotide O
and O
proton O
pump O
inhibitors O
and O
underwent O
endoscopic O
closure O
for O
duodenal O
perforation O
, O
but O
her O
general O
condition O
gradually O
deteriorated O
, O
and O
she O
died O
2 O
weeks O
after O
duodenal O

. O

Another O
patient O
, O
a O
50 O

man O
, O
had O
a O
functional O
NET O
( O

and O
duodenal O
ulcer O
. O

After O
uncontrollable O
liver O
metastasis O
at O
the O

, O
he O
developed O
hypoglycemia O
. O

Although O
octoreotide O

were O
administrated O
for O

, O
his O
hypoglycemia O
was O
uncontrollable O
, O
and O
he O
died O
after O
4 O
months O
owing O
to O

Conclusion O
: O
The O
present O
cases O
show O
that O
advanced O
NETs O
with O
treatment O
- O
uncontrollable O
liver O
metastasis O
can O
transform O
their O
phenotype O
, O
specifically O
from O
a O
nonfunctional O
NET O
into O
a O
functional O
NET O
, O
and O
from O
one O
functional O
NET O
into O
the O
addition O
of O
another O
functional O
NET O
. O

These O
experiences O
suggest O
that O
the O
presence O
of O

might O
be O
a O

The O

The O
findings O

suggest O
that O
the O

is O
correlated O
with O

Vascular O

plays O
a O
major O
role O
in O
driving O

in O

and O
has O
therefore O
become O
a O
key O

. O

Recent O
evidence O
also O
points O
to O
a O
potentially O

important O
role O
of O
galectins O
, O
a O
family O
of O
β O

Indeed O
, O
they O
have O
been O
implicated O
in O

fundamental O
processes O

including O
vascular O
hyperpermeability O
, O

, O
all O
of O
which O
also O
play O
a O

Here O
, O
we O
review O
direct O
evidence O
for O
pathological O
roles O

In O
addition O
, O
we O
extrapolate O
potential O

of O
galectins O
in O
the O
retina O
from O
evidence O
in O
cancer O

We O
conclude O
that O
there O
is O
value O
in O
increasing O
understanding O

in O
retinal O
biology O
, O
in O

the O
hypothesis O
that O
the O

Given O
the O

, O
the O

could O
be O
an O
alternative O
in O

BACKGROUND O
: O
Lesch O
- O
Nyhan O
syndrome O
( O
LNS O
) O
is O
a O
congenital O
X O
- O
linked O
recessive O
neurogenetic O
disorder O
caused O
by O
mutations O
in O
the O
hypoxanthine O
- O
guanine O
phosphoribosyltransferase O
( O
HPRT O
) O
gene O
. O

The O
main O
clinical O
manifestation O
includes O
hyperuricemia O
, O
juvenile O
- O
onset O
gouty O
arthritis O
, O
and O
neurological O
developmental O
disorders O
. O

Studies O
have O
reported O
more O
than O
400 O
HPRT O
gene O
mutation O
sites O
, O
but O
the O
incidence B-EPI
of O
LNS O
in O
the O
Chinese O
population O
is O
extremely O
low O
. O

METHODS O
: O
Here O
we O
report O
a O
16 O
- O
year O
- O
old O
male O
patient O
who O
suffered O
neurological O
dysfunction O
at O
an O
early O
age O
and O
gouty O
arthritis O
in O
his O
youth O
. O

RESULTS O
: O
No O
activity O
of O
the O
HPRT O
enzyme O
was O
detected O
in O
the O
erythrocytes O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
we O
found O
a O
mutation O
on O
exon O
3 O
of O
the O
HPRT O
gene O
in O
the O
patient O
and O
his O
mother O
( O
exon O
3 O
: O
c.143G O
> O
A O
) O
, O
which O
resulted O
in O
arginine O
to O
histidine O
( O
p. O
R48H O
) O
substitution O
in O
the O
encoded O
protein O
. O

The O
same O
mutation O
was O
reported O
in O
several O
European O
families O
, O
but O
was O
found O
for O
the O
first O
time O
in O
a O
Chinese O
family O
. O

CONCLUSIONS O
: O
Clinicians O
in O
China B-LOC
have O
poor O
experience O
in O
diagnosing O
LNS O
cases O
due O
to O
the O
low O
incidence B-EPI
in O
China B-LOC
. O

Therefore O
, O
LNS O
screening O
for O
infants O
or O
adolescents O
with O
hyperuricemia O
, O
gouty O
arthritis O
, O
and O
neurological O
dysfunction O
should O
be O
performed O
. O

Methods O
and O
Findings O
: O
We O
retrospectively O
reviewed O
the O

We O
also O

we O
selected O
the O
ones O
in O
which O
a O

Conclusions O
: O
Conditions O
requiring O

are O
frequent O
in O
Burundian O
children O

have O
a O
completely O

The O
elucidation O

has O
been O
instrumental O

understanding O
the O
roles O

many O

The O

The O
prevalent B-EPI
paradigm O
for O
the O
molecular O
pathology O
has O
been O
that O
there O
are O
two O
global O
mechanisms O
. O

First O
, O
mutations O
that O
reduce O
the O
production O
of O

Second O
, O
mutations O
altering O

also O
introduce O

negative O
effects O
in O

Recent O

that O
endoplasmic O

, O
makes O

This O
suggests O
that O

The O
life O

The O
increased O

The O
interest O

discovery O

various O

As O
a O

it O

Moreover O

the O

Vitamin O
C O

may O
be O
more O

The O
etiology O

The O
diagnosis O

are O
further O
complicated O
as O
most O
neonatal O
seizures O
may O
have O
very O

and O
the O
diagnosis O
may O
be O
just O

so O

The O
treatment O
is O

on O
the O
etiology O

but O
early O
and O
opportune O
intervention O
can O
prevent O
further O
brain O

Although O
early O
identification O

, O
the O

can O
be O
further O
complicated O
by O
the O

possible O
etiologies O

and O
treatments O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
research O
studies O
and O
clinical O
evidence O
have O
shown O
that O
early O
treatment O
with O
anti O

He O
was O

These O
DEPs O
could O

Purpose O
of O
review O
The O
global B-LOC
prevalence B-EPI
of O
obesity O
has O
increased O
rapidly O
over O
the O
last O
decades O
, O
posing O
a O
severe O
threat O
to O
human O
health O
. O

Currently O
, O
bariatric O
surgery O
is O
the O
most O
effective O
therapy O
for O
patients O
with O
morbid O
obesity O
. O

It O
is O
unknown O
whether O
this O
treatment O
is O
also O
suitable O
for O
patients O
with O
obesity O
due O
to O
a O
confirmed O
genetic O
defect O
( O
genetic O
obesity O
disorders O
) O
. O

Therefore O
, O
this O
review O
aims O
to O
elucidate O
the O
role O
of O
bariatric O
surgery O
in O
the O
treatment O
of O
genetic O
obesity O
. O

Recent O
findings O
In O
monogenic O
non O
- O
syndromic O
obesity O
, O
an O
underlying O
genetic O
defect O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
most O
important O
factor O
determining O
the O
efficacy O
of O
bariatric O
surgery O
. O

In O
syndromic O
obesity O
, O
bariatric O
surgery O
result O
data O
are O
scarce O
, O
and O
even O
though O
some O
promising O
follow O
- O
up O
results O
have O
been O
reported O
, O
caution O
is O
required O
as O
patients O
with O
more O
severe O
behavioral O
and O
developmental O
disorders O
might O
have O
poorer O
outcomes O
. O

There O
is O
limited O
evidence O
in O
support O
of O
bariatric O
surgery O
as O
a O
treatment O
option O
for O
genetic O
obesity O
disorders O
; O
hence O
, O
no O
strong O
statements O
can O
be O
made O
regarding O
the O
efficacy O
and O
safety O
of O
these O
procedures O
for O
these O
patients O
. O

However O
, O
considering O
that O
patients O
with O
genetic O
obesity O
often O
present O
with O
life O
- O
threatening O
obesity O
- O
related O
comorbidities O
, O
we O
believe O
that O
bariatric O
surgery O
could O
be O
considered O
a O
last O
- O
resort O
treatment O
option O
in O
selected O
patients O
. O

The O

Over O
the O
last O
10 O
years O
, O
evidence O
has O
accumulated O
that O
autoimmune O
Addison O

Residual O
adrenal O
function O
, O
characterised O
by O
persistent O

is O
present O
in O
around O

is O
present O
in O
some O
patients O
with O
AAD O
for O
more O
than O
20 O

, O
but O
it O
is O
commoner O
in O

The O
clinical O
significance O
of O
residual O
adrenal O

is O
not O
fully O

at O
the O
moment O
, O
but O
as O
it O
signifies O
an O

, O
it O
opens O
up O
the O
possibility O
of O
regeneration O

for O
some O

In O
this O
paper O

we O
discuss O
the O
hypothesis O
that O
altered O

Background O
A O
higher O
risk O
of O
developing O
dementia O
is O
observed O
in O
patients O
with O
atrial O

( O
AF O
) O
. O

Results O
are O
inconsistent O
regarding O
the O
risk O
of O
dementia O
when O
patients O
with O
AF O
use O
different O
anticoagulants O
. O

We O
aimed O
to O
investigate O
the O
risk O
of O
dementia O
in O
patients O
with O
AF O
receiving O
non O
- O
vitamin O
K O
antagonist O
oral O
anticoagulants O
( O
NOACs O
) O
compared O
with O
those O
receiving O
warfarin O

Methods O
and O
Results O
We O
conducted O
a O
nationwide O
population O
- O
based O
cohort O
study O
of O
incident O
cases O
using O
the O
Taiwan O
National O
Health O
Insurance O
Research O
Database O
. O

We O
initially O
enlisted O
all O
incident O
cases O
of O
AF O
and O
then O
selected O
those O
treated O
with O
either O
NOACs O
or O
warfarin O
for O
at O
least O
90 O
days O
between O
2012 O
and O
2016 O
. O

First O
- O
ever O
diagnosis O
of O
dementia O
was O
the O
primary O
outcome O
. O

We O
performed O
propensity O
score O
matching O
to O
minimize O
the O
difference O
between O
each O
cohort O
. O

We O
used O
the O
Fine O
and O
Gray O
competing O
risk O
regression O
model O
to O
calculate O
the O
hazard O
ratio O
( O
HR O
) O
for O
dementia O
. O

We O
recruited O
12 O
068 O
patients O
with O
AF O
( O
6034 O
patients O
in O
each O
cohort O
) O
. O

The O
mean O

was O
3.27 O
and O
3.08 O
years O
in O
the O
groups O
using O
NOACs O
and O
warfarin O
, O
respectively O
. O

Compared O
with O
the O
HR O
for O
the O
group O
using O
warfarin O
, O
the O
HR O
for O

; O
P O
= O
0.0004 O

in O
the O
group O
using O
NOACs O
. O

Subgroup O
analysis O
demonstrated O
that O
users O
of O
NOAC O
aged O
65 O
to O
74 O
years O
, O
with O
a O
high O
risk O
of O
stroke O
or O
bleeding O
were O
associated O
with O
a O
lower O
risk O
of O
dementia O
than O
users O
of O
warfarin O
with O
similar O
characteristics O
. O

Conclusions O
Patients O
with O
AF O
using O
NOACs O
were O
associated O
with O
a O
lower O
risk O
of O
dementia O
than O
those O
using O
warfarin O

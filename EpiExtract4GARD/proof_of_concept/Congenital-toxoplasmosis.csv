34204401,"Epidemiological Aspects of Maternal and Congenital Toxoplasmosis in Panama. In Panama, epidemiological data on congenital toxoplasmosis are limited, making it difficult to understand the scope of clinical manifestations in the population and factors that may increase the risk of infection. This study provides insight into the epidemiological situation of maternal and congenital toxoplasmosis in Panama and contributing information on the burden of this disease in Central America. Blood samples were collected from 2326 pregnant women and used for the detection of anti-<i>T. gondii</i> antibodies. A high seroprevalence (44.41%) was observed for <i>T. gondii</i> infection in pregnant women from different regions of Panama, with an estimated incidence rate of congenital toxoplasmosis of 3.8 cases per 1000 live births. The main risk factors associated with <i>T. gondii</i> infection using bivariate statistical analysis were an elementary level education and maternal age range of 34-45 years. Multivariate statistical analyses revealed that in some regions (San Miguelito, North and West regions), the number of positive cases correlated with the presence of pets, stray dogs and the consumption of poultry. In other regions (East and Metropolitan regions), the absence of pets was considered a protective factor associated with negative cases, while the presence of stray cats and the age range of 25-34 years did not represent any risk in these regions.",0.9972335696220398,True,set(),set(),"{'central america', 'panama'}",{'estimated incidence'},['3 . 8 cases per 1000 live births']
34390383,"Toxoplasma gondii in South America: a differentiated pattern of spread, population structure and clinical manifestations. Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular parasite belonging to the phylum Apicomplexa. It has a worldwide distribution and can infect a wide variety of intermediate hosts, including humans. In South America, toxoplasmosis shows high health impacts, and the incidence of the disease is frequently reported and more severe than in other regions, such as Europe. Although most T. gondii infections are asymptomatic, severe manifestations can occur in cases of congenital toxoplasmosis and immunocompromised individuals. In South America, the ocular disease in immunocompetent individuals is also frequently reported. Treatment for any clinical manifestation of toxoplasmosis consists of the combination of sulfadiazine (SDZ) and pyrimethamine (PYR). However, failures in the treatment of toxoplasmosis have been reported, especially in South America, suggesting the acquisition of resistance against SDZ and PYR. Another paradigm present in the literature is that once infected with T. gondii, the host is immunologically protected from further reinfections. However, some studies indicate cases of congenital transmission of T. gondii from immunocompetent pregnant women with chronic infection, suggesting the possibility of reinfection in humans. Thus, in this review, we will cover several aspects of South American T. gondii isolates, such as genetic characterization, disease manifestation, host reinfection and drug resistance.",0.9961850047111511,True,set(),set(),"{'worldwide', 'south america', 'europe'}",{'incidence'},[]

The perinatal CMV infection was observed in 11.9% of the patients with positive serology for CMV.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The routine antenatal screening with chemiluminescence technology should be recommended in general population to avoid congenital malformations, as long as the prevalence of serum specific antibodies to TORCH agents is high and seropositivity rate increases with age.",0.9954635500907898,True,set(),set(),set(),{'prevalence'},"['1', '2', '1 / 2']"
33711379,"Ocular Findings in Infants with Congenital Toxoplasmosis after a Toxoplasmosis Outbreak. <h4>Purpose</h4>We investigated the prevalence of ocular abnormalities in infants vertically exposed to Toxoplasma gondii infection during an outbreak in Santa Maria City, Brazil.<h4>Design</h4>Consecutive case series.<h4>Participants</h4>A total of 187 infants were included.<h4>Methods</h4>The infants were recruited from January 2018 to November 2019. All mothers were screened for syphilis and human immunodeficiency virus before delivery. Toxoplasmosis infection was confirmed in all mothers and infants based on the presence of serum anti-T. gondii immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies. All infants underwent an ophthalmologic examination; ocular abnormalities were documented using a wide-field digital imaging system. Neonatal cranial sonography or head computed tomography was performed in 181 infants, and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was screened for anti-T. gondii IgG and IgM antibodies in 159 infants. Peripheral blood samples from 9 infants and their mothers were analyzed for the presence of T. gondii DNA by real-time polymerase chain reaction.<h4>Main outcome measures</h4>Ocular abnormalities associated with congenital toxoplasmosis.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 187 infants were examined. Twenty-nine infants (15.5%) had congenital toxoplasmosis, of whom 19 (10.2%) had ocular abnormalities, including retinochoroiditis in 29 of 38 eyes (76.3%), optic nerve abnormalities in 5 eyes (13.2%), microphthalmia in 1 eye (2.6%), and cataract in 2 eyes (5.3%). Bilateral retinal choroidal lesions were found in 10 of 19 infants (52.6%). Nine eyes of 6 infants had active lesions, with retinal choroidal cellular infiltrates at the first examination. Thirteen (7.2%) of 181 infants screened presented with cerebral calcifications. Eighty-three percent of the screened infants were positive for anti-T. gondii IgG and negative for IgM antibodies in the CSF. Congenital toxoplasmosis was higher in mothers infected during the third pregnancy trimester, and maternal treatment during pregnancy was not associated with a lower rate of congenital toxoplasmosis.<h4>Conclusions</h4>High prevalence rates of clinical manifestations were observed in infants with congenital toxoplasmosis after a waterborne toxoplasmosis outbreak, the largest yet described.

34254575,"Congenital toxoplasmosis in humans: an update of worldwide rate of congenital infections. The morbidity due to congenital toxoplasmosis in humans is very high. Most of these infected children are likely to develop symptoms of clinical toxoplasmosis. Sequelae in fetus resulting from Toxoplasma gondii infections in women who become infected with this parasite during pregnancy can be devastating and enormous efforts are directed in some countries to prevent these consequences. Here, an update on congenital toxoplasmosis in humans, especially the rate of congenital infections in humans worldwide, is provided. Although several countries have surveillance programmes, most information on the rate of congenital transmission is from France and Brazil. Because of compulsory national screening programme in France to detect and treat women with recently acquired T. gondii infection with anti-toxoplasma therapy, the rate of congenital transmission and the severity of disease in children are declining. Infections by this parasite are widely prevalent in Brazil. The severity of clinical toxoplasmosis in Brazilian children is very high and may be associated with the genetic characteristics of T. gondii isolates prevailing in animals and humans in Brazil.

33247407,"Molecular and serological study on congenital toxoplasmosis in newborn of Shiraz, Southern Iran. Toxoplasmosis is a zoonotic disease caused by an obligatory intracellular parasite, Toxoplasma gondii. The congenital form of the disease is a significant health problem around the world. This study aimed to determine the incidence of congenital toxoplasmosis in the newborn of Shiraz, Southern Iran, between 2013 and 2018. A total of 2498 blood samples of neonates were randomly collected by a standard heel puncture technique and dried on Guthrie cards from Shiraz newborn screening center. We provided questionnaire forms for mothers according to their demographic characteristics, such as age, place of residence, history of having cats as pet, and literacy level. ELISA immunocapture and PCR assays were applied to detect anti-Toxoplasma IgM and the parasite DNA in dried blood spot samples. The anti-Toxoplasma IgM antibody was detected in two out of the 2498 infants. Moreover, borderline titers were observed in 3 samples, which were considered suspicious, so these were retested after 18 months to detect IgG against Toxoplasma. Positive IgG titer was observed in two infants who had a positive IgM level. The genome of Toxoplasma was detected in one sample out of 2498. No significant differences were seen between the epidemiological factors with congenital infection. The incidence of congenital toxoplasmosis is estimated at 0.08% of studied samples. It seems that this incidence could present to the health ministry as a logical research achievement for the national screening program of newborns in Iran.",0.8776986002922058,True,set(),set(),"{'iran', 'shiraz', 'southern iran'}",{'incidence'},['0 . 08 %']
34283858,"Toxoplasmosis infection among pregnant women in Africa: A systematic review and meta-analysis. The epidemiology of toxoplasmosis in pregnancy is a major issue in public health. Toxoplasmosis is caused by the protozoan parasite. Toxoplasma parasite is at high risk for life-threatening diseases during pregnancy. Congenital toxoplasmosis results from a maternal infection acquired during gestation. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis was aimed to determine the seropositive prevalence of toxoplasmosis infection among pregnant women who attended antenatal care in a health facility in Africa. A systematic review and meta-analysis of published and unpublished studies were included. Databases such as MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, African Journals Online were used with relevant search terms. The quality of the articles was critically evaluated using the tool of the Joanna Briggs Institute. Data were extracted on Microsoft word 2016. Meta-analysis was conducted using STATA 14 software. The heterogeneity and publication bias were assessed using the I2 statistics and Egger's test, respectively. Forest plots were used to present the pooled prevalence and odds ratio with a 95% confidence interval of meta-analysis using the random effect model. In total, 23 studies comprising 7,579 pregnant women across ten countries in Africa were included in this meta-analysis. The overall prevalence of seropositive toxoplasmosis among pregnant women in Africa was 51.01% (95% CI; 37.66, 64.34). The heterogeneity test showed that heterogeneity was high, I2 = 99.6%, P-value < 0.001. The variables responsible for the source of heterogeneity were included from Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Ethiopia. Overall prevalence of toxoplasmosis in Africa showed that more than one-half of pregnant women were infected.

33872467,"Evaluation of implementation of the primary, secondary and tertiary prevention measures of the Surveillance Program of Gestational and Congenital Toxoplasmosis in the city of Londrina-PR. Toxoplasmosis acquired during pregnancy is one that can lead to death or malformations of the foetus, and it is a complex disease to diagnose. The objective of the study was to evaluate the Surveillance Program of Gestational and Congenital Toxoplasmosis. To assess primary prevention, 424 pregnant women were interviewed regarding their knowledge of prevention measures in 2019. Secondary prevention measures were assessed, and the results of anti-Toxoplasma gondii serological tests were collected from pregnant women, from 2015 to 2018. In tertiary prevention measures, babies of mothers with a recent suspicion of T. gondii infection were screened to verify forwarding to the reference service. As a result, 45.5% (192/424) reported that they had received guidance from health professionals; 35.4% (68/192) changed their risk habits. The variables of schooling and age, having received prior guidance from health professionals and feline possession, proved to be significant when associated with the notions of preventive measures. 90.2% (17,423/19,319) of pregnant women had undergone serological tests to detect anti-T. gondii antibodies, but there was an excess in requests for tests and medication and only 40.6% (26/64) of the children were referred to the reference hospital.

34327813,"Psychiatric disorders in individuals with neurofibromatosis 1 in Denmark: A nationwide register-based cohort study. The aim of this study was to assess the risks of psychiatric disorders in a large cohort of 905 individuals with NF1 and 7614 population comparisons matched on sex and year of birth. The cohort was linked to the Danish Psychiatric Central Research Register to ascertain information on hospital contacts for psychiatric disorders based on the International Classification of Diseases version 8 and 10. The hazard ratio (HR) for a first psychiatric hospital contact was higher in girls (4.19, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.81-9.69) and boys with NF1 (5.02, 95% CI 3.27-7.69) <7 years of age than in the population comparisons. Both sexes had increased HRs for developmental disorders, including attention deficit/hyperactivity disorders, autism spectrum disorders, and intellectual disabilities in childhood. Females with NF1 had also increased HRs for unipolar depression, other emotional and behavioral disorders, and severe stress reaction and adjustment disorders in early adulthood. The HRs for psychoses, schizophrenia, bipolar disorders, and substance abuse were similar in individuals with NF1 and the population comparisons. Finally, the cumulative incidence of a first hospital contact due to any psychiatric disorder by age 30 years was 35% (95% CI 29-41) in females and 28% (95% CI 19-37) in males with NF1. Thus, screening for psychiatric disorders may be important for early diagnosis and facilitation of appropriate and effective treatment in individuals with NF1.",0.9973119497299194,True,{'GARD:0010420'},{'neurofibromatosis'},{'denmark'},{'cumulative incidence'},[]
34475743,"Epidemiology of neuroendocrine tumors of the appendix in the USA: a population-based national study (2014-2019). <h4>Background</h4>The appendix is the third most common place for neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) along the digestive tract and NETs are the most common neoplasms of the appendix. However, there are limited population-based data on the epidemiology of this disease. Using a large database, we sought to describe the epidemiology and risk association of NETs of the appendix.<h4>Method</h4>We queried a multi-institutional database (Explorys Inc., Cleveland, OH, USA), comprising 360 hospitals in the United States (US), for patients with a diagnosis of NETs of the appendix from 2014-2019.<h4>Results</h4>Of the 30,324,050 individuals in the database, 2020 patients had an appendiceal NET diagnosis (0.007%). The most common presenting symptoms included abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Patients with appendiceal NETs were more likely to be female (odds ratio [OR] 1.36, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.24-1.49), Caucasian (OR 2.71, 95%CI 2.40-3.07), with a history of smoking (OR 1.82, 95%CI 1.65-2.01), family history of primary gastrointestinal malignancy (OR 7.26, 95%CI 6.31-8.33), diagnosis of multiple endocrine tumor type 1 (OR 52.31, 95%CI 23.15-118.23), or neurofibromatosis type 1 (OR 16.37, 95%CI 7.24-37.01).<h4>Conclusions</h4>In a population-based study in the US, using the Explorys database, we found the overall prevalence of NETs of the appendix to be 7 per 100,000 persons. The incidence in the year January 2019-January 2020 was 0.4 per 100,000 individuals. These rates are higher than previously reported and may be more accurate, given the more comprehensive nature of the Explorys database.",0.9971017241477966,True,{'GARD:0007866'},{'neurofibromatosis type 1'},"{'usa', 'oh', '##leveland', 'us', 'the united states', 'c'}","{'overall prevalence', 'incidence'}","['0 . 007 %', '7 per 100 , 000 persons', '0 . 4 per 100 , 000 individuals']"
34390698,"Birth Characteristics Among Children Diagnosed with Neurofibromatosis Type 1 and Tuberous Sclerosis. <h4>Objective</h4>To evaluate whether children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and tuberous sclerosis have different birth characteristics compared with the general population.<h4>Study design</h4>We identified all individuals born in Sweden between 1973 and 2014 from the nationwide Medical Birth Register for whom information on both biological parents was available (n = 4 242 122). Individuals with NF1 and individuals with tuberous sclerosis were identified using data from Swedish population-based health data registers. Using logistic regression models, we assessed the associations between these 2 neurocutaneous syndromes and birth characteristics in a cohort that included 1804 subjects with NF1 and 450 with tuberous sclerosis.<h4>Results</h4>Children with NF1 and tuberous sclerosis were significantly more likely to be born preterm and via cesarean delivery. In addition, children with NF1 were also more likely to be born with other birth characteristics, such as short length, a large head circumference, and a low Apgar score. Moreover, children with NF1 had an increased odds of being born with a high birth weight or large for gestational age (OR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.42-1.82 and OR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.60-2.06, respectively).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Children with NF1 and tuberous sclerosis differ from the general population in terms of several birth characteristics, with the strongest associations observed for high birth weight and large for gestational age in individuals with NF1.",0.9880883097648621,True,"{'GARD:0007866', 'GARD:0007830'}","{'tuberous sclerosis', 'Neurofibromatosis Type 1', 'neurofibromatosis type 1', 'Tuberous Sclerosis'}",{'sweden'},set(),[]
33956037,"Ectropion Uveae in neurofibromatosis type 1: a new manifestation. <h4>Abstract</h4>Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a rare genetic disorder with an autosomal dominant transmission and an estimated incidence of 1:2500-3500 live birth. Penetrance is virtually 100%, but the expression is highly variable and almost every organ can be affected. Diagnosis of NF1 is made with at least two of the following diagnostic criteria: six or more cafè-au-lait spots, two neurofibromas or one plexiform neurofibroma, axillary or groin freckling, optic glioma, two Lisch nodules, bone dysplasia and first-degree relative with NF1. Other ocular manifestations include orbital neurofibromas, cafè-au-lait spots on the eyelids, congenital dysplasia of the sphenoids wing and con-genital glaucoma and choroidal abnormalities. Congenital Ectropion Uveae (CEU) is a rare, non-progressive anomaly characterized by the presence of iris pigment epithelium on the anterior surface of the iris stroma, resulting from its proliferation. CEU probably depends on embryological disorders in neural cells and/or neuroectoderm of the optic cell. In this paper the authors describe three patients with CEU and NF1 found in 243 consecutive NF1 patients.",0.9729803204536438,True,"{'GARD:0007866', 'GARD:0007191', 'GARD:0006513'}","{'neurofibroma', 'neurofibromatosis type 1', 'Neurofibromatosis type 1', 'glioma'}",set(),{'estimated incidence'},['1 : 2500']
34257422,"Increased risk for dementia in neurofibromatosis type 1. <h4>Purpose</h4>To determine the risk for dementia in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) using a Finnish nationwide cohort of individuals with NF1, and data from national registries.<h4>Methods</h4>A Finnish cohort of 1,349 individuals with confirmed NF1 according to the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) diagnostic criteria was compared with a control cohort of 13,870 individuals matched for age, sex, and area of residence. Dementia-related hospital visits were retrieved from the Finnish Care Register for Health Care using International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) diagnosis codes G30 and F00-F03. Purchases of antidementia drugs were queried with Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification code N06D from the drug reimbursement register maintained by the Social Insurance Institution of Finland. The follow-up spanned 1998-2014.<h4>Results</h4>Totals of 16 and 165 individuals with at least two dementia-related diagnoses or drug purchases were identified in the NF1 and control cohorts, respectively. The hazard ratio for dementia in NF1 was 1.67 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00-2.80, P = 0.050). In an analysis stratified by the type of dementia, the risk for Alzheimer disease was increased in NF1 compared to controls with a hazard ratio of 2.88 (95% CI 1.47-5.66, P = 0.002).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Dementia and especially Alzheimer disease are previously unrecognized neurological complications of NF1.",0.9673896431922913,True,{'GARD:0007866'},{'neurofibromatosis type 1'},{'finland'},set(),[]
34325735,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 with subarachnoid hemorrhage due to multiple and de novo aneurysms: a case report. <h4>Background</h4>Neurofibromatosis type 1 causes various lesions in many organs including the skin, and the incidence of complications with intracranial aneurysms is 9-11%. Here we report a case of neurofibromatosis type 1 with subarachnoid hemorrhage due to multiple and de novo aneurysms.<h4>Case presentation</h4>The patient was a 49-year-old Japanese woman with a history of neurofibromatosis type 1. She was transported to our hospital owing to disturbance of consciousness and was diagnosed with subarachnoid hemorrhage by computed tomography. Computed tomography angiography revealed multiple, small intracranial aneurysms, and we suspected that one of them in the peripheral branch of the left middle cerebral artery was the source of hemorrhage based on the distribution of hematoma. The patient underwent emergency surgery. Because it was difficult to identify an aneurysm in the most peripheral part of the left middle cerebral artery in the initial surgery, only one aneurysm was clipped. Later, a peripheral aneurysm was clipped using the navigation system. Because both aneurysms were small intracranial aneurysms (< 2 mm), either of them could be the source of hemorrhage. The postoperative course was good, and the patient was discharged in healthy condition. Because brain magnetic resonance imaging performed in the previous year did not find aneurysms at the same site, she was diagnosed with rupture of a de novo aneurysm. Neurofibromatosis type 1 might have caused the rupture of multiple intracranial aneurysms in a short period in this patient.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Neurofibromatosis type 1 may be complicated by the formation of multiple intracranial aneurysms in a short period.",0.8863000273704529,True,{'GARD:0007866'},"{'neurofibromatosis type 1', 'Neurofibromatosis type 1'}",set(),{'incidence'},"['9 -', '%']"
34528095,"Morbidity and Function Loss After Resection of Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumors. <h4>Background</h4>Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are aggressive soft tissue sarcomas. Their resection may lead to serious morbidity. Incidence of postoperative motor and sensory deficits is unknown, and reconstruction aimed at restoring such deficits is infrequently carried out.<h4>Objective</h4>To identify the incidence and risk factors of postoperative morbidity in MPNST as well as the use and outcomes of functional reconstructions in these patients.<h4>Methods</h4>Postoperative function and treatment of MPNSTs diagnosed from 1988 to 2019 in 10 cancer centers was obtained. Two models were constructed evaluating factors independently associated with postoperative motor (<M3) or critical sensory loss. Critical sensation was defined as partial or complete loss of hand, foot, or buttocks sensation.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 756 patients (33.4% neurofibromatosis type 1, NF1) were included. MPNSTs originated in 34.4% from a major nerve. Of 658 surgically treated patients, 27.2% had <M3 muscle power and 24.3% critical sensory loss. Amputations were carried out in 61 patients. Independent risk factors for motor and sensory loss included patients with NF1, symptomatic, deep-seated, extremity, or plexus tumors originating from major nerves (all P < .05). A total of 26 patients underwent functional reconstructions. The majority (64%) of these patients regained at least M3 muscle power and 33% M4 despite 86% receiving multimodal therapy.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Resection of MPNSTs commonly results in motor and sensory deficits. Patients with NF1, symptomatic, deep-seated tumors, arising from major nerves were associated with a higher risk for developing postoperative morbidity. Functional reconstructions are infrequently performed but can improve functional outcomes.",0.8718352913856506,True,"{'GARD:0007866', 'GARD:0010872'}","{'MPNST', 'neurofibromatosis type 1'}",set(),{'incidence'},[]

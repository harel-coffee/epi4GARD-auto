34542603,"Predictors of functional outcomes in patients with facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy. Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is one of the most prevalent muscular dystrophies characterized by considerable variability in severity, rates of progression and functional outcomes. Few studies follow FSHD cohorts long enough to understand predictors of disease progression and functional outcomes, creating gaps in our understanding which impacts clinical care and the design of clinical trials. Efforts to identify molecularly targeted therapies create a need to better understand disease characteristics with predictive value to help refine clinical trial strategies and understand trial outcomes. Here we analyzed a prospective cohort from a large, longitudinally-followed registry of patients with FSHD in the United States to determine predictors of outcomes such as need for wheelchair use. This study analyzed de-identified data from 578 individuals with confirmed FSHD type 1 enrolled in the United States National Registry for FSHD Patients and Family members. Data were collected from January 2002 to September 2019 and included an average of nine years (range 0 to 18) of follow up surveys. Data were analyzed using descriptive epidemiological techniques, and risk of wheelchair use was determined using cox proportional hazards models. Supervised machine learning analysis was completed using Random Forest modeling and included all 189 unique features collected from registry questionnaires. A separate medications-only model was created that included 359 unique medications reported by participants. Here we show that smaller allele sizes were predictive of earlier age at onset, diagnosis and likelihood of wheelchair use. Additionally, we show that women were more likely overall to progress to wheelchair use and at a faster rate as compared to men, independent of genetics. Use of machine learning models that included all reported clinical features showed that the effect of allele size on progression to wheelchair use is small compared to disease duration, which may be important to consider in trial design. Medical comorbidities and medication use add to the risk for need for wheelchair dependence, raising the possibility for better medical management impacting outcomes in FSHD. The findings in this study will require further validation in additional, larger datasets but could have implications for clinical care, and inclusion criteria for future clinical trials in FSHD.",0.994113028049469,True,{'GARD:0009941'},{'facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy'},{'the united states'},{'prevalent'},[]
34441403,"Precise Epigenetic Analysis Using Targeted Bisulfite Genomic Sequencing Distinguishes FSHD1, FSHD2, and Healthy Subjects. The true prevalence of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is unknown due to difficulties with accurate clinical evaluation and the complexities of current genetic diagnostics. Interestingly, all forms of FSHD are linked to epigenetic changes in the chromosome 4q35 D4Z4 macrosatellite, suggesting that epigenetic analysis could provide an avenue for sequence-based FSHD diagnostics. However, studies assessing DNA methylation at the FSHD locus have produced conflicting results; thus, the utility of this technique as an FSHD diagnostic remains controversial. Here, we critically compared two protocols for epigenetic analysis of the FSHD region using bisulfite genomic sequencing: Jones et al., that contends to be individually diagnostic for FSHD1 and FSHD2, and Gaillard et al., that can identify some changes in DNA methylation levels between groups of clinically affected FSHD and healthy subjects, but is not individually diagnostic for any form of FSHD. We performed both sets of assays on the same genetically confirmed samples and showed that this discrepancy was due strictly to differences in amplicon specificity. We propose that the epigenetic status of the FSHD-associated D4Z4 arrays, when accurately assessed, is a diagnostic for genetic FSHD and can readily distinguish between healthy, FSHD1 and FSHD2. Thus, epigenetic diagnosis of FSHD, which can be performed on saliva DNA, will greatly increase accessibility to FSHD diagnostics for populations around the world.",0.9764545559883118,True,{'GARD:0009941'},{'facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy'},"{'g', 'j'}",{'prevalence'},[]
34315378,"Promising Perspective to Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy Treatment: Nutraceuticals and Phytochemicals. Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is in the top three list of all dystrophies with an approximate 1:8000 incidence. It is not a life-threatening disease; however, progression of the disease extends over being wheel-chair bound. Despite some drug trials have been continuing, including DUX4 inhibition, TGF-ÃŸ inhibition and resokine which promote healthier muscle, there is not an applicable treatment option for FSHD today. Still, there is a need for new agent or agents to heal, to stop or at least to slow down the muscle wasting. Current FSHD studies with nutraceuticals as vitamin C, vitamin E, coenzyme Q10, zinc, selenium, and phytochemicals as curcumin or genistein, daidzein flavonoids provide promising treatment strategies. In this review we will present the clinical and molecular nature of FSHD and focus on nutraceuticals and phytochemicals that may alleviate FSHD. Via interconnection of impaired pathophysiological FSHD pathways together with nutraceuticals and phytochemicals in the light of literature, we present both studied and novel approaches that can contribute FSHD treatment.",0.9231903553009033,True,{'GARD:0009941'},{'facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy'},set(),{'incidence'},['1 : 8000']

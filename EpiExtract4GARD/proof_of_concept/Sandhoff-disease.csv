34554397,"Analysis of the HEXA, HEXB, ARSA, and SMPD1 Genes in 68 Iranian Patients. Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) are known as genetic disorders with an overall prevalence of 1 per 7700 live births. Sphingolipidosis, which is a subgroup of LSDs, is resulted from mutations in the coding genes of specific enzymes of sphingolipid hydrolases. The current study aimed to provide additional knowledge on the genotype of sphingolipidoses disease among Iranian patients affected by the disease. In this research, we studied 68 unrelated Iranian patients diagnosed with one kind of sphingolipidoses from 2014 to 2019. Thereafter, genomic DNA was isolated from their peripheral blood leukocytes samples in EDTA in terms of the manufacturer's protocol. All the coding exons and exon-intron boundaries of the related genes were sequenced and then analyzed using the NCBI database. Finally, they were reviewed using some databases such as the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) and ClinVar ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinva ). By studying 22 MLD patients, 18 different variations of the ARSA gene were found, one of which was new including, named as c.472 T > G p. (Cys158Gly). Out of 15 Sandhoff disease (SD) patients, 11 different variations of the HEXB gene were found. Correspondingly, the c.1083-2delA was not reported earlier. By investigating 21 Iranian patients with Tay-Sachs disease (TSD), one new variant was found as c.622delG. The study of 10 Niemann-Pick disease A/B (NPDA/B (patients has led to the identification of 9 different SMPD1 gene variations, among which 3 variations were novel mutations. The results of the present study can be expanded to the genotypic spectrum of Iranian patients with MLD, SD, TSD, and NPD diseases and also used to innovate more effective methods for the detection of genetic carriers as well as diagnosing and counseling of Iranian patients affected with these disorders.",0.9214159846305847,True,"{'GARD:0013334', 'GARD:0007672', 'GARD:0007604', 'GARD:0007737'}","{'sandhoff disease', 'niemann-pick disease', 'tay-sachs disease', 'sphingolipidosis', 'sphingolipidoses'}",{'edta'},{'overall prevalence'},['1 per 7700 live births']

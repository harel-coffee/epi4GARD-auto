19280993,"Metabolic syndrome in Portugal: prevalence and implications for cardiovascular risk--results from the VALSIM Study. <h4>Introduction</h4>The metabolic syndrome (MS) is a constellation of risk factors of metabolic origin that is associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Several regional studies have been conducted to determine its prevalence, but they are insufficient to determine the situation nationally or to characterize overall cardiovascular risk in Portugal.<h4>Objective</h4>To determine the prevalence of MS and each of its components in adult primary health care users in Portugal.<h4>Methods</h4>The VALSIM Study, involving 719 general practitioners (GPs), was performed in a primary care setting, based on stratified distribution and proportional to the population density of each region of mainland Portugal and the islands of Madeira and the Azores. The first two adult patients scheduled for an appointment on a given day were invited to participate, irrespective of the reason for the consultation. After informed consent was obtained, a questionnaire on sociodemographic, clinical and laboratory data was completed by the GP. A previous diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD), stroke or DM was identified by the GP based on medical records. A diagnosis of MS was defined according to the NCEP ATP III criteria. Logistic regression multivariate analysis was used to assess the risk of MS according to age, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC) and region of residence for each gender, and to determine the association of CAD, stroke and DM with gender, age, BMI, WC, blood pressure and previous diagnosis of hypertension (HT), fasting glucose and previous diagnosis of DM.<h4>Results</h4>The study included 16,856 individuals (mean age 58.1+/-15.1 years, 18-96 years; 61.62% women). The prevalence of MS adjusted for gender, age and size of region was 27.5% and showed regional variations, being highest in the Alentejo (30.99%) and lowest in the Algarve (24.42%). MS was more common among women and increased with age, BMI and WC. Independent protective factors were residence in the Algarve (odds ratio [OR]: 0.78; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.66-0.92 p=0.002) or in Lisbon and Tagus Valley (OR: 0.83, 95% CI 0.77-0.91, p<0.001), while residence in the Northern (OR: 1.11; 95% CI 1.01-1.21, p=0.03) or Central regions (OR: 1.08; 95% CI 1.002-1.16, p=0.045) was an independent risk factor after correction for gender and age. MS was linked to increased prevalence of HT (OR: 3.88; 95% CI 3.61-4.18, p<0.001), and high blood pressure was the most frequent MS component, particularly in men (93.7%). MS was the most powerful factor associated with a diagnosis of DM, particularly in women (OR 7.23; 95% CI 6.22-8.40, p<0.001). Although there was a strong association between MS and CAD (OR: 1.16; 95% CI 1.01-1.34, p=0.043), the most potent risk factor associated with CVD was HT.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The prevalence of MS in Portugal is high (27.5%) and is strongly linked to the occurrence of CVD, and in particular to DM. These results highlight the need to implement preventive strategies for reducing overall cardiovascular risk in the Portuguese population.",0.9976741671562195,True,set(),set(),"{'lisbon', 'the algarve', 'tagus valley', 'the azores', 'algarve', 'portugues', 'portugal', 'madeira', 'the alentejo'}","{'prevalence', 'occurrence'}",['58 . 1 + /']
31818857,"Genetic Basis of Human Congenital Heart Disease. Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common major congenital anomaly with an incidence of ∼1% of live births and is a significant cause of birth defect-related mortality. The genetic mechanisms underlying the development of CHD are complex and remain incompletely understood. Known genetic causes include all classes of genetic variation including chromosomal aneuploidies, copy number variants, and rare and common single-nucleotide variants, which can be either de novo or inherited. Among patients with CHD, ∼8%-12% have a chromosomal abnormality or aneuploidy, between 3% and 25% have a copy number variation, and 3%-5% have a single-gene defect in an established CHD gene with higher likelihood of identifying a genetic cause in patients with nonisolated CHD. These genetic variants disrupt or alter genes that play an important role in normal cardiac development and in some cases have pleiotropic effects on other organs. This work reviews some of the most common genetic causes of CHD as well as what is currently known about the underlying mechanisms.",0.9966451525688171,True,set(),set(),set(),{'incidence'},[]
33968136,"A Population-Specific Major Allele Reference Genome From The United Arab Emirates Population. The ethnic composition of the population of a country contributes to the uniqueness of each national DNA sequencing project and, ideally, individual reference genomes are required to reduce the confounding nature of ethnic bias. This work represents a representative Whole Genome Sequencing effort of an understudied population. Specifically, high coverage consensus sequences from 120 whole genomes and 33 whole exomes were used to construct the first ever population specific major allele reference genome for the United Arab Emirates (UAE). When this was applied and compared to the archetype hg19 reference, assembly of local Emirati genomes was reduced by ∼19% (i.e., some 1 million fewer calls). In compiling the United Arab Emirates Reference Genome (UAERG), sets of annotated 23,038,090 short (novel: 1,790,171) and 137,713 structural (novel: 8,462) variants; their allele frequencies (AFs) and distribution across the genome were identified. Population-specific genetic characteristics including loss-of-function variants, admixture, and ancestral haplogroup distribution were identified and reported here. We also detect a strong correlation between <i>F</i> <sub>ST</sub> and admixture components in the UAE. This baseline study was conceived to establish a high-quality reference genome and a genetic variations resource to enable the development of regional population specific initiatives and thus inform the application of population studies and precision medicine in the UAE.",0.996269702911377,True,set(),set(),"{'the united arab emirates', 'the uae', 'u'}",set(),[]
34352899,"Embryology, Malformations, and Rare Diseases of the Cochlea. Despite the low overall prevalence of individual rare diseases, cochlear dysfunction leading to hearing loss represents a symptom in a large proportion. The aim of this work was to provide a clear overview of rare cochlear diseases, taking into account the embryonic development of the cochlea and the systematic presentation of the different disorders. Although rapid biotechnological and bioinformatic advances may facilitate the diagnosis of a rare disease, an interdisciplinary exchange is often required to raise the suspicion of a rare disease. It is important to recognize that the phenotype of rare inner ear diseases can vary greatly not only in non-syndromic but also in syndromic hearing disorders. Finally, it becomes clear that the phenotype of the individual rare diseases cannot be determined exclusively by classical genetics even in monogenetic disorders.",0.9959549903869629,True,set(),set(),set(),{'overall prevalence'},[]
11694544,"Hirschsprung disease, associated syndromes, and genetics: a review. Hirschsprung disease (HSCR, aganglionic megacolon) is the main genetic cause of functional intestinal obstruction with an incidence of 1/5000 live births. This developmental disorder is a neurocristopathy and is characterised by the absence of the enteric ganglia along a variable length of the intestine. In the last decades, the development of surgical approaches has dramatically decreased mortality and morbidity, which has allowed the emergence of familial cases. HSCR appeared to be a multifactorial malformation with low, sex dependent penetrance and variable expression according to the length of the aganglionic segment, suggesting the involvement of one or more gene(s) with low penetrance. So far, eight genes have been found to be involved in HSCR. This frequent congenital malformation now stands as a model for genetic disorders with complex patterns of inheritance.",0.9641534090042114,True,{'GARD:0006660'},"{'hirschsprung disease', 'aganglionic megacolon'}",set(),{'incidence'},['1 / 5000 live births']
2309705,"A genetic study of Hirschsprung disease. Hirschsprung disease, or congenital aganglionic megacolon, is commonly assumed to be a sex-modified multifactorial trait. To test this hypothesis, complex segregation analysis was performed on data on 487 probands and their families. Demographic information on probands and the recurrence risk to relatives of probands are presented. An increased sex ratio (3.9 male:female) and an elevated risk to sibs (4%), as compared with the population incidence (0.02%), are observed, with the sex ratio decreasing and the recurrence risk to sibs increasing as the aganglionosis becomes more extensive. Down syndrome was found at an increased frequency among affected individuals but not among their unaffected sibs, and the increase was not associated with maternal age. Complex segregation analysis was performed on these family data. The families were classified into separate categories by extent of aganglionosis. For cases with aganglionosis beyond the sigmoid colon, the mode of inheritance is compatible with a dominant gene with incomplete penetrance, while for cases with aganglionosis extending no farther than the sigmoid colon, the inheritance pattern is equally likely to be either multifactorial or due to a recessive gene with very low penetrance. A model of gene action with random effects during morphogenesis is compatible with our observations.",0.6875012516975403,True,{'GARD:0006660'},"{'hirschsprung disease', 'aganglionic megacolon'}",set(),{'incidence'},['0 . 02 %']

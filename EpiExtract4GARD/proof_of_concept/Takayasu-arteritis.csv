34314100,"Epidemiology of Takayasu arteritis in Shanghai: A hospital-based study and systematic review. <h4>Background</h4>Takayasu arteritis (TAK) is a rare large vessel vasculitis, and epidemiological data on TAK are lacking in China. Thus, we designed this study to estimate the TAK prevalence and incidence in residential Shanghai, China.<h4>Methods</h4>Data on diagnosed TAK cases aged over 16 years were retrieved from 22 tertiary hospitals in Shanghai through hospital electronic medical record systems between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2017 to estimate the prevalence and incidence. A systematic literature review based on searches in PubMed, Ovid-Medline, Excerpta Medica Database (EMBASE), Web of Science, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) was performed to summarize TAK distribution across the world.<h4>Results</h4>In total 102 TAK patients, with 64% female, were identified. The point prevalence (2015-2017) was 7.01 (95% CI 5.65-8.37) cases per million, and the mean annual incidence was 2.33 (1.97-3.21) cases per million. The average age of TAK patients was 44 ± 16 years, with the highest prevalence (11.59 [9.23-19.50] cases per million) and incidence (3.55 [0.72 3.74] cases per million) in the 16 to 34 years population. Seventeen reports were included in the system review, showing that the epidemiology of TAK varied greatly across the world. The incidence and prevalence were both relatively higher in Asian countries, with the prevalence ranging 3.3-40 cases per million and annual incidence ranging 0.34-2.4 cases per million.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The prevalence and incidence of TAK in Shanghai was at moderate to high levels among the previous reports. The disease burden varied globally among racial populations.",0.9978715181350708,True,{'GARD:0007730'},{'Takayasu arteritis'},"{'s', 'china', 'shanghai', '##hanghai'}","{'incidence', 'prevalence', 'annual incidence'}","[') cases per million ,', '.', ') cases per million', 'cases per million )', '.', 'cases per million )', '3 .', '3 - 40 cases per million and', '0 .', '34 - 2 . 4 cases per million']"
34143786,"Takayasu arteritis: Prevalence and clinical presentation in Switzerland. <h4>Objective</h4>Takayasu arteritis (TAK) is a rare immune-mediated vasculitis of the aorta and its branches. Aims were to calculate prevalence and incidence in Switzerland, to assess disease activity and performance of MR-Angiography (MRA).<h4>Methods</h4>31 patients were recorded in a database, 27 were followed prospectively up to 3 years. Prevalence was calculated based on data of the national statistical bureau. Disease activity was defined using the revised EULAR criteria. MRA depicted stenotic changes and aortic wall enhancement.<h4>Results</h4>A disease prevalence of 14.5/1.000.000 inhabitants and an incidence of 0.3/1.000.000 per year was calculated. Aortic wall enhancement was found in 10 patients while in clinical and serological remission. EULAR criteria missed 5 patients with disease activity with isolated elevations of ESR/CRP. Arterial stenosis did not change over time in 5 cases, it improved in 2 and increased in 7. At follow-up 16 patients were treated with tocilizumab, 11/16 in monotherapy, 5 patients were treatment-free, 25/27 stayed in remission.<h4>Conclusion</h4>In addition to prevalence and incidence, our data show that MRA qualifies to detect subclinical disease activity, but, on the other hand, that EULAR criteria may miss disease activity in case of isolated elevation of ESR/CRP.",0.9973880648612976,True,{'GARD:0007730'},{'Takayasu arteritis'},{'switzerland'},"{'prevalence', 'incidence'}","['14 . 5 / 1 . 000 . 000 inhabitants', '0 .', '3 / 1 . 000 . 000 per year', '11 /', '25']"
34393161,"Changes in Colonic Inflammation Related with Takayasu Arteritis during a 10-year Observation Period. Takayasu arteritis (TA) sometimes presents with colitis, which may be diagnosed as inflammatory bowel disease unclassified (IBDU) because of atypical or mixed findings of ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease. We herein report an 18-year-old girl presenting with colitis with an occasional high fever eventually diagnosed as TA with IBDU. Colonic inflammation was initially discontinuous and stronger in the proximal colon, atypical of UC. However, over 10-year observation, the distribution of colonic inflammation varied and became UC-like. Variations in TA-related colonic inflammations over time have been unclear. Our long-term observation might help clarify the details of TA-related colonic inflammation.",0.9872961044311523,True,{'GARD:0007730'},"{'Takayasu arteritis', 'Takayasu Arteritis'}",set(),set(),[]
33870620,"Update on pregnancy in Takayasu arteritis-A narrative review. Takayasu arteritis (TA) is a chronic, idiopathic large-vessel vasculitis that affects women of reproductive age, and has significant maternal and fetal implications. Although there are contrasting data on the effect of TA on fertility, most studies have shown that fertility outcomes remain unaffected. The disease activity of TA usually either remains stable or decreases during pregnancy. The important fetomaternal complications are maternal hypertension, pre-eclampsia, prematurity, and intrauterine growth restriction. To reduce maternal and fetal morbidity, controlling the disease before conception is important. This review article discusses the various implications, challenges, and medical and endovascular management of TA during pregnancy.",0.7488538026809692,True,{'GARD:0007730'},{'Takayasu arteritis'},set(),set(),[]

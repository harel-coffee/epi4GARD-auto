34309752,"Ten-year trends in the incidence of microtia: a nationwide population-based study from Taiwan. <h4>Purpose</h4>Few studies have explored population-based incidence rates of microtia using nationwide data. The aim of this study was to analyze the 10-year secular trends in the incidence of microtia and/or anotia in Taiwan from 2008 to 2017 using nationwide population-based data.<h4>Methods</h4>Patient data were retrieved from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Dataset, after identifying 1152 children aged ≤ 1 year with a first-time diagnosis of microtia or anotia between January 2008 and December 2017. The annual microtia-anotia incidence rate was the sum of new microtia-anotia cases in a year divided by total infant population in the year. Furthermore, we used the annual percent change (APC) to study the secular trend in microtia-anotia incidence rate.<h4>Results</h4>The annual incidence rate of microtia-anotia averaged across the 10-year period was 57.7 per 100,000 infants (standard deviation = 8.6). The annual incidence rates of microtia and anotia were 53.3 and 4.4 per 100,000 infants, respectively, during this period. Furthermore, female infants had a higher incidence than males (63.3 vs. 52.4 per 100,000). The incidence of microtia-anotia gradually decreased between 2008 and 2017 with an APC of - 5.64% (95% CI - 9.31 ~ - 1.18%, p = 0.004). Since 2011, females had a significantly higher annual incidence rate of microtia-anotia than males.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The incidence of microtia-anotia was 57.7 per 100,000 infants in Taiwan, which declined during the study period 2008-2017. The female-to-male incidence ratio was 1.21:1.",0.9982884526252747,True,{'GARD:0000431'},{'microtia-anotia'},{'taiwan'},"{'incidence', 'annual incidence'}","['57 . 7 per 100 , 000 infants', '53 . 3', '4 . 4 per 100 , 000 infants', '3', '52 . 4 per 100 , 000', '57 . 7 per 100 , 000 infants']"
21656661,"Microtia-anotia: a global review of prevalence rates. <h4>Background</h4>There are few published studies on microtia-anotia frequency.<h4>Methods</h4>Using data from birth defects surveillance programs around the world, we conducted a systematic review on the frequency of microtia-anotia to further explore the differences in prevalence across countries. Ninety-two birth defects surveillance programs were evaluated with a total of 8917 cases of microtia-anotia. We computed the prevalence per 10,000 births for each surveillance program for total cases of microtia-anotia (microtia types I to IV), microtia (types I to III), and anotia (type IV). Prevalence ratios were calculated by large geographic areas, race/ethnicity, and by surveillance methodologies.<h4>Results</h4>The overall prevalences were: microtia-anotia, 2.06 (confidence interval [CI], 2.02-2.10); microtia, 1.55 (CI, 1.50-1.60); and anotia 0.36 (CI, 0.34-0.38). Higher prevalences were observed for the Americas, Northern Europe and Asia, among Hispanics and Asians, and among active ascertainment and hospital-based surveillance programs.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We observed marked variation in the prevalence of microtia-anotia across surveillance programs and within countries. These results must be interpreted cautiously as this variability may be explained mainly by differences in surveillance methods. However, given the magnitude of some of the differences, other factors may also be involved. This study contributes to the knowledge of the prevalence of microtia-anotia by providing a critical analysis of the existing data. In addition, it supports the need for a coding system that allows complete phenotype characterization of microtia-anotia, including severity and laterality, as well as for further studies on the variation of its frequency related to race and ethnicity.",0.9978994131088257,True,{'GARD:0000431'},"{'microtia-anotia', 'Microtia-anotia'}","{'northern europe', 'the americas', '##otia', 'an', 'anotia', 'asia', 'micro'}","{'prevalence', 'overall prevalence'}","['per 10 , 000 births']"
33136839,"Hemifacial Microsomia Review: Recent Advancements in Understanding the Disease. Hemifacial microsomia (HFM) is the second most common congenital disability of the face, with a prevalence of 1 in 3000 to 5600 live births. Although etiology is still not fully understood, including both genetics and environmental factors, the latest reports indicate the prominence of premature loss of the neural crest cells. What is more, a deficit of muscles of mastication, except the masseter, correlates in the pathomechanism of mandibular underdevelopment. Due to the significant phenotypic diversification, the typical picture of HFM cannot be determined. It may present as an esthetic concern-minor asymmetry with deformed auricle, and on the contrary, as microtia/anotia with conductive type hearing loss, hypoplastic mandible, and microphthalmia, impairing patient's daily activities. Referring to psychosocial problems, it has been proved that in population with HFM, there is a modestly elevated risk for behavior problems, social competence, and less acceptance. Over the years, more comprehensive methods of assessing the extent and severity of the HFM as the OMENS (+) classification have emerged.

33842409,"Microtia: A Data Linkage Study of Epidemiology and Implications for Service Delivery. <b>Introduction:</b> Previous studies of microtia epidemiology globally have demonstrated significant geographical and ethnic variation, cited broadly as affecting 3-5 in 10,000 live births. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of microtia in a largely homogeneous ethnic population in the United Kingdom (Wales) and to identify factors, such as distance and socioeconomic status, which may influence the access to surgical intervention. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> A retrospective cohort study was conducted using data linkage to identify patients born between 2000 and 2018 with a diagnosis of microtia. Microtia incidence was calculated using annual and geographic birth rates. Surgical operation codes were used to classify patients into those that had no surgery, autologous reconstruction or prosthetic reconstruction. Sociodemographic attributes were compared using descriptive statistics to determine differences in access to each type of surgical intervention. <b>Results:</b> A total of 101 patients were identified, 64.4% were male and the median age was 12 (8-16). The mean annual incidence was 2.13 microtia cases per 10,000 births over the 19-year study period. Both temporal and geographic variation was noted. The majority of patients undergoing surgery opted for autologous reconstruction (72.9%) at a median age of 9 (7-10) compared to 7 (5-8) for prosthetic reconstruction. Autologous reconstruction had a higher median number of surgeries (2, 1-3) than prosthetic (1.5, 1-2) and a higher median socioeconomic status of 3 (2-4) compared to 2 (1-4) for the prosthetic cohort. There were no statistically significant differences in the distance traveled for surgery. <b>Discussion:</b> This study highlights a role for data linkage in epidemiological analyses and provides a revised incidence of microtia in Wales. Although the majority of patients opted for autologous reconstruction, demographic disparities in socioeconomic status warrant further investigation, emphasizing the importance of striving for equity in accessibility to surgical intervention.",0.996822714805603,True,set(),set(),"{'the united kingdom', 'microtia', 'wales', 'micro'}","{'incidence', 'annual incidence'}","['2 . 13', 'cases per 10 , 000 births', '1 - 3', '1 - 2', '1 - 4']"
27818252,"Associated anomalies in cases with anotia and microtia. Infants with anotia and microtia (AM) often have other non-AM associated congenital anomalies. The purpose of this investigation was to assess the prevalence and the types of these associated anomalies in a defined population. The associated anomalies in infants with AM were collected in all livebirths, stillbirths and terminations of pregnancy during 29 years in 387,067 consecutive births in the area covered by our population-based registry of congenital malformations. Of the 146 cases with AM registered during this period, representing a prevalence of 3.77 per 10,000, 49.3% had associated anomalies. There were 14 (9.6%) cases with chromosomal abnormalities including 5 trisomies 18, and 18 (12.3%) nonchromosomal recognized dysmorphic conditions including 6 cases with oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum. However, numerous other recognized dysmorphic conditions were registered. Forty (27.4%) of the cases had multiple congenital anomalies (MCA). Anomalies especially in the cardiovascular, the musculoskeletal, the urogenital, the central nervous, and the digestive systems, and facial clefts were the most common other anomalies. This study included special strengths: each affected child was examined by a geneticist, all elective terminations were ascertained, and the surveillance for anomalies was continued until 2 years of age. In conclusion the overall prevalence of associated anomalies, which was one in every two cases, emphasizes the need for a thorough investigation of cases with AM.

32395540,"Characteristics of 43 multiple auricular deformity case families and auricle morphology in 463 microtia patients in South China. Background:Earlier studies have suggested that microtia is a genetic disease with a worldwide incidence of microtia is between 0.83/10,000 and 17.40/10,000. For microtia, auricle morphology is the most crucial characteristic. However, no studies have been performed to characterize the genetic similarity of microtia and auricle morphology similarity. For the sporadic patients, the relationship between the gestational age of parents and the incidence of microtia is unclear. To obtain the characteristics of auricular deformity multiple case family (AD-MCF) and clarify the relationship between genetic similarity and auricle morphology similarity in AD-MCF. Methods:This study included 463 AD patients who were diagnosed by Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, from 2013 to 2019. Among these patients, 116 are from 43 MCF and the other 347 patients are sporadic. For the patients from families, the disease status of the four generations of immediate family members and the family tree map were collected to analyze the similarity of auricle shape in family members. A score evaluated the similarity of auricle shape according to the structure of the residual ear and the similarity in the morphology of each auricle. Moreover, the population distribution of AD and the gestational age of patients were further analyzed. Results:From 2013 to 2019, a total of 463 patients were diagnosed as microtia in our hospital. There were 427 patients with unilateral disease and 36 patients with bilateral disease. Among them, 116 patients were from 34 families and 9 de novo families. The total scores of patients in different genetic difference levels were compared and were found significantly different (P<0.001). Moreover, 58.14% of families were consistent with the law of chromosomal recessive genetic diseases. Importantly, we found that the gestational age of father in microtia de novo families is 30.94±0.75, and mother in de novo is 28.39±0.73 that is significantly higher than the gestational ages of parents from microtia families with P value =0.0001.

33198842,"Congenital heart defects in patients with isolated microtia: evaluation using colour Doppler echocardiographic image. <h4>Background</h4>The objective of this study was to delineate the characteristics and incidence of congenital heart disease (CHD) in patients with isolated microtia and to determine whether the prevalence of CHD among patients with isolated microtia increases with the severity of microtia.<h4>Methods</h4>A total of 804 consecutive patients had a pre-operative colour Doppler echocardiographic examination. A retrospective study was performed with the clinical and imaging data from November, 2017 to January, 2019. The χ2 test was performed to analyse the interaction between isolated microtia and CHD.<h4>Results</h4>With the colour Doppler echocardiographic examination's data from 804 consecutive isolated microtia patients, we found CHD, including atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, tetralogy of Fallot, patent ductus arteriosus, and others, occurred in 52 of 804 patients (6.5%). Atrial septal defect prevalence in patients with isolated microtia was significantly higher than ventricular septal defect (24/804 versus 11/804, p < 0.05) and patent ductus arteriosus (24/804 versus 2/804, p < 0.001). Ventricular septal defect prevalence in patients with isolated microtia was significantly higher than patent ductus arteriosus (11/804 versus 2/804, p < 0.05). All four types of microtia (concha-type microtia, small concha-type microtia, lobule-type microtia, and anotia) had similar incidences of CHD with no difference in the incidences among these types (p > 0.05 respectively). Furthermore, there was no significant difference in the incidence of the atrial septal defect among the four subtypes (p > 0.05 respectively). Similarly, ventricular septal defect and patent ductus arteriosus also showed no differences (p > 0.05 respectively).<h4>Conclusions</h4>The overall incidences of CHD and three most common CHD subtypes (atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, and patent ductus arteriosus) in patients with isolated microtia are higher than general population. The prevalence of CHD among patients with isolated microtia does not increase with the severity of microtia. According to our experience in this study, we suggest colour Doppler echocardiographic imaging should be performed for isolated microtia patients soon after birth if possible. Furthermore, for the plastic surgeon and anaesthesiologist, it is important to take pre-operative colour Doppler echocardiographic images which can help evaluate heart function to ensure the safety of the peri-operative period.

33786756,"Birth prevalence of congenital anomalies in Argentina, according to socioeconomic level. Birth prevalence of congenital anomalies (CA) in Argentina is estimated around 1.7%. CA are the second leading cause of infant mortality. Poverty and other adverse socioeconomic conditions have been associated with birth defects. To describe the prevalence at birth of CA, according to the two proxy variables of socioeconomic level: the health subsector of the hospital where the cases were born (PUB-public versus PRI-private or social security) and its geographical location. The design of the study was ecological using the data of the National Network of Congenital Anomalies of Argentina (RENAC); from October 2010 to December 2018. CA birth prevalence was estimated using the Poisson regression. We used a logistic regression model to analyze the association birth prevalence to health subsector and geographical region. A total of 2,202,994 births were examined in the study period, with a global CA prevalence of 1.69% (95% CI 1.68-1.71). The highest prevalence was observed in PUB hospitals when comparing to PRI hospitals at the country level and in all regions. There were differences in the prevalence of selected congenital anomalies with a statistically significant association to PUB (observed in anencephaly, encephalocele, hydrocephalus, microcephaly, holoprosencephaly, microtia/anotia, cleft lip and palate, postaxial polydactyly, talipes equinovarus, talipes calcaneovalgus, and gastroschisis).

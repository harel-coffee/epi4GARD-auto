33563743,"The first Saudi baby with classic homocystinuria diagnosed by universal newborn screening. Classic homocystinuria (CH) is an inborn error of metabolism caused by cystathionine beta-synthase enzyme deficiency. Affected patients present with intellectual disability and other comorbidities. If diagnosed early in infancy and started treatment, inevitable complications can be prevented. Newborn screening (NBS) uses tandem mass-spectroscopy (MSMS) to measure the amino acid levels. In CH, the first-tier screening test is the measurement of methionine by MSMS. If methionine remained elevated in the recall sample, plasma level for homocysteine is performed. A newborn infant underwent routine NBS in our institute that showed elevated methionine in the first and the recall sample. Thereafter, total serum homocysteine was found to be elevated, consistent with the diagnosis of CH. An early medical and dietary management was commenced for this first Saudi baby diagnosed with homocystinuria by universal NBS. This report demonstrates that NBS for CH is feasible and effective in preventing the disease burden.",0.9934478402137756,True,"{'GARD:0006667', 'GARD:0010770'}","{'classic homocystinuria', 'homocystinuria'}",set(),set(),[]
34449519,"Early Diagnosis of Classic Homocystinuria in Kuwait through Newborn Screening: A 6-Year Experience. Kuwait is a small Arabian Gulf country with a high rate of consanguinity and where a national newborn screening program was expanded in October 2014 to include a wide range of endocrine and metabolic disorders. A retrospective study conducted between January 2015 and December 2020 revealed a total of 304,086 newborns have been screened in Kuwait. Six newborns were diagnosed with classic homocystinuria with an incidence of 1:50,000, which is not as high as in Qatar but higher than the global incidence. Molecular testing for five of them has revealed three previously reported pathogenic variants in the <i>CBS</i> gene, c.969G>A, p.(Trp323Ter); c.982G>A, p.(Asp328Asn); and the Qatari founder variant c.1006C>T, p.(Arg336Cys). This is the first study to review the screening of newborns in Kuwait for classic homocystinuria, starting with the detection of elevated blood methionine and providing a follow-up strategy for positive results, including plasma total homocysteine and amino acid analyses. Further, we have demonstrated an increase in the specificity of the current newborn screening test for classic homocystinuria by including the methionine to phenylalanine ratio along with the elevated methionine blood levels in first-tier testing. Here, we provide evidence that the newborn screening in Kuwait has led to the early detection of classic homocystinuria cases and enabled the affected individuals to lead active and productive lives.",0.9859017133712769,True,{'GARD:0006667'},{'classic homocystinuria'},"{'qatar', 'kuwait', 'global'}",{'incidence'},"['1 : 50 , 000 ,']"

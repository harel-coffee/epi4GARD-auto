34082800,"Birth prevalence of phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency: a systematic literature review and meta-analysis. <h4>Background</h4>Phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder that results in elevated concentrations of phenylalanine (Phe) in the blood. If left untreated, the accumulation of Phe can result in profound neurocognitive disability. The objective of this systematic literature review and meta-analysis was to estimate the global birth prevalence of PAH deficiency from newborn screening studies and to estimate regional differences, overall and for various clinically relevant Phe cutoff values used in confirmatory testing.<h4>Methods</h4>The protocol for this literature review was registered with PROSPERO (International prospective register of systematic reviews). Pubmed and Embase database searches were used to identify studies that reported the birth prevalence of PAH deficiency. Only studies including numeric birth prevalence reports of confirmed PAH deficiency were included.<h4>Results</h4>From the 85 publications included in the review, 238 birth prevalence estimates were extracted. After excluding prevalence estimates that did not meet quality assessment criteria or because of temporal and regional overlap, estimates from 45 publications were included in the meta-analysis. The global birth prevalence of PAH deficiency, estimated by weighting regional birth prevalences relative to their share of the population of all regions included in the study, was 0.64 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.53-0.75) per 10,000 births and ranged from 0.03 (95% CI 0.02-0.05) per 10,000 births in Southeast Asia to 1.18 (95% CI 0.64-1.87) per 10,000 births in the Middle East/North Africa. Regionally weighted global birth prevalences per 10,000 births by confirmatory test Phe cutoff values were 0.96 (95% CI 0.50-1.42) for the Phe cutoff value of 360 ± 100 µmol/L; 0.50 (95% CI 0.37-0.64) for the Phe cutoff value of 600 ± 100 µmol/L; and 0.30 (95% CI 0.20-0.40) for the Phe cutoff value of 1200 ± 200 µmol/L.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Substantial regional variation in the birth prevalence of PAH deficiency was observed in this systematic literature review and meta-analysis of published evidence from newborn screening. The precision of the prevalence estimates is limited by relatively small sample sizes, despite widespread and longstanding newborn screening in much of the world.",0.9979662895202637,True,"['birth prevalence', 'prevalence', 'birth prevalence estimates', 'prevalence estimates', 'birth prevalences']","['0 . 64', 'per 10 , 000 births', '0 . 03', '1 . 18']","['global', 'southeast asia', 'the middle east / north africa']",,,
35023679,"Frequency of PAH Mutations Among Classic Phenylketon Urea Patients in Mazandaran and Golestan Provinces, North of Iran. <h4>Background</h4>Phenylketonuria (PKU) is the most common aminoacidopathy with an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. A global PKU prevalence is estimated about 6.002 in 100,000 newborns. In Iran, the prevalence of PKU is estimated at about 1 in 4,698, and it shows an increasing trend from north (0.0015%) to south (0.02%) of the country. Untreated PKU causes mental retardation, microcephaly, and seizure. PAH gene mutations located at chromosome 12q23 are responsible for the classical type of this disease. The spectrum of PAH mutations is varied in different ethnicities and different parts of the world. The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of PAH mutation in the Mazandaran province, which could be useful for genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis.<h4>Methods</h4>A total of 66 individuals from 33 families from two provinces (9 families from Golestan and 24 families from Mazandaran) from north of Iran participated in this study. After genomic DNA extraction, PAH gene analysis was carried out using DNA sequencing of both coding and non-coding regions by ABI 3130XL genetic analyzer.<h4>Results</h4>Twenty-six different mutations were identified in the PAH gene in this study. Four mutations including IVS10-11 (c.1066-11G>A), c.727C>T (p.Arg243X), c.898G>T (p.Ala300Ser), and c.601C>T (p.His201Tyr) were the most common mutations with 37.48% frequency in Mazandaran province. Most frequent mutations in Golestan province were IVSI0-11 (c.1066-11G>A), c.722delG (p.Arg241fs), c.842C>T (p.Pro281Leu), and IVSII+5 (G>A) with frequency 58.57%.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The results from the present study verify heterogeneity of the PAH gene and may help to diagnose tests for carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis of the PKU disease in Iranian population.",0.9967848062515259,True,['prevalence'],"['6 . 002 in 100 , 000 newborns', '1 in 4 , 698', '%']","['of iran', 'global', 'ira', 'ma', 'dar', 'north', 'iran']",,,['ira']
32893076,"Spectrum of PAH gene mutations and genotype-phenotype correlation in patients with phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency from Shanxi province. <h4>Background</h4>Phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency (PAHD) is an autosomal recessive inborn error that affects phenylalanine (Phe) metabolism. It has a complex phenotype with many variants and genotypes among different populations. Shanxi province is a high-prevalence area of PAHD in China.<h4>Methods</h4>In this study, eighty-nine PAHD patients were subjected to genetic testing using Sanger sequencing, followed by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification analysis (MLPA). Allelic and genotypic phenotype values (APV and GPV, respectively) were used for genotype-based phenotypic prediction.<h4>Results</h4>Fifty-one types of variants, including three novel forms, were identified. The predominant variant was p.R243Q (22.09%), followed by p.R53H (10.47%), p.EX6-96A > G (9.30%), p.V399V (5.23%) and p.R413P (3.49%). Notably, mild hyperphenylalaninemia (MHP) has a high prevalence in this region (up to 45.76%), and the variant p.R53H was solely observed in patients of MHP. According to the genotype-phenotype prediction, the APV/GPV system was well correlated with the metabolic phenotype of most PAHD patients.<h4>Conclusion</h4>We have systematically constructed the mutational and phenotypic spectrum of PAH in Shanxi province. Hence, this study will help to further understand the genotype-phenotype associations in PAHD patients, and it may offer more reliable genetic counseling and management.",0.8426573872566223,True,['prevalence'],,"['shanxi province', 'chin', 'a', 'shan', 'province']",,,

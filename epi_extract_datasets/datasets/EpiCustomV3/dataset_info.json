{"EpiSet4NER": 
 {"description": "EpiSet4NER is a bronze-standard dataset for epidemiological entity recognition of location, epidemiologic types (e.g. 'prevalence', 'annual incidence', 'estimated occurrence'), and epidemiological rates (e.g. '1.7 per 1,000,000 live births', '2.1:1.000.000', 'one in five million', '0.03%') created by the Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center (GARD), a program in the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, one of the 27 National Institutes of Health. It was labeled programmatically using spaCy NER and rule-based methods. This weakly-supervised teaching method allowed us to construct this imprecise dataset with minimal manual effort and achieve satisfactory performance on a multi-type token classification problem. The test set was manually corrected by 3 NCATS researchers and a GARD curator (genetic and rare disease expert). It was used to train EpiExtract4GARD, a BioBERT-based model fine-tuned for NER.\nFor more details see https://github.com/ncats/epi4GARD/tree/master/EpiExtract4GARD \n",

17416416,"Waldenström's Macroglobulinaemia (WM) is an uncommon B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder defined as a predominately inter-trabecular bone marrow infiltration of small lymphocytes with an IgM monoclonal gammopathy. There are little reliable incidence and survival data for the disease in the UK since epidemiological studies have usually grouped it with other plasma cell dyscrasias. This study uses data from the South Thames Haematology Register and the Thames Cancer Registry for South East England to describe the incidence and survival of WM, and the influence of selected clinical factors on survival. Between 1999 and 2001, there were 152 new cases of WM recorded in the South Thames Haematology Register, giving an age standardised rate of 0.55 per 100,000 European standard population (0.73 for males and 0.42 for females). The incidence increased with age, and the median age at diagnosis was 75 years (range 45-93 years). The estimated 5 year survival was 57% (95% CI: 47-66%). Age over 70, haemoglobin less than 10 g/L and the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status grade 3-4 at diagnosis were associated with worse survival. Between 1985 and 2002, the Thames Cancer Registry recorded 750 cases of WM occurring in the wider area of South East England. The relative 5 year survival for patients aged less than 70 years was 70% (95% CI: 60-81%) and for patients aged 70 and over it was 50% (95% CI: 41-60%)."
15875532,"BACKGROUND: Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare disease caused by C1 inhibitor mutations. Although more than 100 mutations have been described, epidemiologic data are lacking; therefore, we developed a Spanish HAE patient registry. OBJECTIVE: To study the prevalence of HAE and the current state of diagnosis and treatment of this disease in Spain. METHODS: Epidemiologic data were obtained by direct contact with physicians who treat patients with HAE and with patients themselves. Diagnosis was evaluated by measuring C1 inhibitor levels and function, and most families also underwent genetic studies. RESULTS: We registered 444 patients (minimal prevalence, 1.09 per 100,000 inhabitants), many of whom are asymptomatic (never having symptoms) (n = 61, 13.7%). Most symptomatic patients (62.9%) receive long-term prophylaxis with attenuated androgens (80.9%) and antifibrinolytic agents (22.8%), alone or in combination, but no patients are receiving long-term prophylaxis with C1 inhibitor. There is a long delay in diagnosis (mean, 13.1 years). Nine patients underwent a tracheotomy as a consequence of a laryngeal attack, and 30 families recalled a total of 38 relatives who died of HAE, which underlines the severity of the illness. CONCLUSIONS: The detected minimal prevalence of HAE in Spain is 1.09 per 100,000 inhabitants. Because this is a rare disease and some patients may be misdiagnosed, this prevalence could be higher."
19320656,"Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is an autosomal dominant disease associated with a partial deletion on chromosome 4q35. Few relevant investigations have been reported on its epidemiology and were essentially based on clinical diagnosis, having been performed before recognition of the molecular mutation. We report an epidemiological survey on FSHD patients, in which the diagnosis was obtained by combined clinical and molecular evaluation. The survey concerned the north-east Italian province of Padova, an area of 871,190 inhabitants (1 January 2004). We identified 40 patients affected by FSHD based on clinical diagnosis. In 33 of them, the EcoRI fragment size in the 4q35 region ranged from 14 to 35 kb. Four other patients belonging to the same family harbored a 38-kb fragment. In these four cases, the relationship between the borderline deletion with the mild FSHD phenotype was corroborated by additional haplotype reconstruction and segregation analysis. Interestingly, the same mild facial-sparing clinical pattern was apparent only in one other patient with an EcoRI fragment of 32 kb, suggesting that this unusual FSHD phenotype may be due to very small 4q35 deletions. On the whole, estimating a prevalence rate of 44 x 10(-6), our survey confirmed FSHD as one of the most frequent neuromuscular disorders in Western populations."
17406640,"We have performed an entire-population-based survey of the epidemiology and penetrance of Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) in Finland - a country that is among the best-studied genetic isolates in the world. During our long-term clinical follow-up period since 1970, we have so far identified 36 LHON families in Finland, comprised of almost 1000 family members. Counting the unaffected family members has been possible thanks to accessible genealogical records, and this has improved the accuracy of our penetrance figures by minimizing the sample bias. Our results, although confirming some well-known features of LHON, indicate that the overall penetrance of LHON is lower than previously estimated, and that affected females have a higher incidence of affected offspring compared to the unaffected females. The prevalence of LHON in Finland is 1:50 000, and one in 9000 Finns is a carrier of one of the three LHON primary mutations."
18657826,"To determine an accurate estimate of the prevalence of congenital heart defects (CHD) using current standard diagnostic modalities.We obtained data on infants with CHD delivered during 1998 to 2005 identified by the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program, an active, population-based, birth defects surveillance system. Physiologic shunts in infancy and shunts associated with prematurity were excluded. Selected infant and maternal characteristics of the cases were compared with those of the overall birth cohort.From 1998 to 2005 there were 398 140 births, of which 3240 infants had CHD, for an overall prevalence of 81.4/10 000 births. The most common CHD were muscular ventricular septal defect, perimembranous ventricular septal defect, and secundum atrial septal defect, with prevalence of 27.5, 10.6, and 10.3/10 000 births, respectively. The prevalence of tetralogy of Fallot, the most common cyanotic CHD, was twice that of transposition of the great arteries (4.7 vs 2.3/10 000 births). Many common CHD were associated with older maternal age and multiple-gestation pregnancy; several were found to vary by sex.This study, using a standardized cardiac nomenclature and classification, provides current prevalence estimates of the various CHD subtypes. These estimates can be used to assess variations in prevalence across populations, time, or space."
22469211,"Existing epidemiological studies of Myasthenia Gravis have generally examined small populations. Few national studies have been conducted, and published incidence and prevalence rates vary widely. We report one of the largest national studies of Myasthenia Gravis, and the first incidence and prevalence rates for Australia.Prescriptions for Pyridostigmine Bromide in 2009 were utilized from a national prescribing database to estimate incidence and the prevalence of symptomatic and treated disease. Crude rates were age-standardized to the WHO world population. We compared standardized rates to recent national studies from Norway and Taiwan.In 2009, there were 2574 prevalent cases of symptomatic and treated Myasthenia Gravis, corresponding to an annual crude prevalence rate of 117.1 per 1 million residents. There were 545 incident cases, yielding a crude incidence rate of 24.9 per 1 million residents. The crude incidence in women and men was estimated to be 27.9 and 21.9 per 1 million, respectively. Prevalence and incidence rates were higher in women than men between the ages of 15 and 64 years, and were higher in men than women in those older than 65 years. Rates peaked between the ages of 74 and 84 years, declining thereafter. Standardized incidence was higher in Australia than Norway, but similar to Taiwan (P-values = 0.007 and 1.00, respectively).This first Australian epidemiological study of symptomatic Myasthenia Gravis is one of the largest population-based studies ever reported and supports higher incidence rates for Myasthenia Gravis. Myasthenia Gravis disproportionately affected younger females and older males."
25712311,"Hypospadias is a common congenital malformation. The prevalence of hypospadias has a large geographical variation, and recent studies have reported both increasing and decreasing temporal trends. It is unclear whether hypospadias prevalence is associated with maternal age.To analyze the prevalence and trends of total hypospadias, isolated hypospadias, hypospadias with multiple congenital anomalies, hypospadias with a known cause, and hypospadias severity subtypes in Europe over a 10-year period and to investigate whether maternal age is associated with hypospadias.We included all children with hypospadias born from 2001 to 2010 who were registered in 23 EUROCAT registries. Information on the total number of births and maternal age distribution for the registry population was also provided. We analyzed the total prevalence of hypospadias and relative risks by maternal age.From 2001 to 2010, 10,929 hypospadias cases were registered in 5,871,855 births, yielding a total prevalence of 18.61 per 10,000 births. Prevalence varied considerably between different registries, probably due to differences in ascertainment of hypospadias cases. No significant temporal trends were observed with the exceptions of an increasing trend for anterior and posterior hypospadias and a decreasing trend for unspecified hypospadias. After adjusting for registry effects, maternal age was not significantly associated with hypospadias.Total hypospadias prevalence was stable in 23 EUROCAT registries from 2001 to 2010 and was not significantly influenced by maternal age."
20331952,"BACKGROUND: The number of individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD) in the U.S. is unknown. Determination of burden of disease, healthcare issues, and policies is best served by representative estimations of the SCD population. PURPOSE: To update SCD population estimates by using recent U.S. Census and birth-cohort SCD prevalence for at-risk populations as available through the centralized reporting of universal newborn screening for hemoglobinopathies, with an effort to demonstrate the potential effect of early mortality. METHODS: National and state SCD populations were estimated based on the 2008 U.S. Census, using total, African-American, and Hispanic birth-cohort disease prevalence derived from the National Newborn Screening Information System. Estimates were corrected for early mortality for sickle cell anemia using data from the CDC's Compressed Mortality Report and published patient-cohort survival information. RESULTS: National SCD population estimates ranged from 104,000 to 138,900, based on birth-cohort disease prevalence, but from 72,000 to 98,000 when corrected for early mortality. Several limitations were noted in the available data, particularly for SCD mortality in adults. CONCLUSIONS: The number of individuals with SCD in the U.S. may approach 100,000, even when accounting for the effect of early mortality on estimations. A paucity of high-quality data limits appropriate estimation. State-to-state variability may preclude application of state-specific information to other states or to the nation as a whole. Standardized collection and centralized reporting, a surveillance system, will be necessary to assess the size and composition of the U.S. SCD population."
2785614,"In a national study the prevalence of open meningocele and myelomeningocele as well as the geographical distribution in the Federal Republic of Germany was determined among the life-born infants during 1982 and 1983. The prevalence rates of the single districts and states and the federal territory were established based upon standardized reports of nearly all Children's Hospitals, Departments of Child Surgery and the major Centers of Neurosurgery. In Hamburg the study was extended by establishing the number of abortions because of medical indications after the prenatal diagnosis of a myelomeningocele. In 1982 and 1983 there were 354 resp. 342 infants born with an open myelomeningocele, thus the prevalence rate was 0.569 and 0.575/1000 live births. The average prevalence rate was 0.57/1000 live births. Compared with international studies our data are corresponding with reports from countries with a relative low frequency. The prevalence rates of the states in the federal territory differ between 0.42/1000 live births in Hamburg and 0.78/1000 in Bremen; these differences are not statistically significant. In 9 from 247 districts, the reported rates were significantly higher than the average rate. Because of the small number of children born with this malformation in the single districts, any conclusions from these results are not warranted. Quite different from reports of other countries (Great Britain, United States of America) this study did not show essential geographic differences in the federal territory. Prenatal diagnosis and subsequent termination of pregnancy lowered the prevalence rate of open meningomyelocele at birth in Hamburg from 0.61/1000 to 0.42/1000."
24497219,"Since the original description, there have been only few epidemiological studies of Wolfram syndrome (WS).Aims of the present paper are to ascertain WS prevalence and expression in a district of North-eastern Sicily, i.e. a geographic area where consanguineous unions are not very unusual.Prevalence rates of WS in the Messina district were calculated by taking into consideration both the total population (653,737) and the populations included within the 0-30 year age range (202,681). We estimated the relative prevalence of WS among patients with youth-onset insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (DM) who are currently aged under 30 years (256).Global WS prevalence in our district is 1:54,478, whereas prevalence among individuals under 30 is 1:16,890 and relative prevalence among patients with juvenile-onset insulin-dependent DM is 1:22.3. When compared with the patients with insulin-dependent DM of Messina district, WS patients did not exhibit significant differences in terms of biochemical features at DM onset, whereas age at DM diagnosis was significantly earlier in WS group.(a) WS prevalence is not so infrequent as generally expected; (b) in our series, DM presented before 10 years in 11/12 patients and ten cases have already developed all the four peculiar manifestations of WS by 26 years; (c) 9/12 patients exhibited a homozygous frameshift/truncation mutation (Y454_L459del_fsX454), which is the one most frequently found also in patients from other Italian regions; (d) age at DM diagnosis was significantly earlier in WS group than in the patients with insulin-dependent DM of Messina district."
8442867,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this article is to determine the prevalence of the cleft lip and palate and its association with some risking factors. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective, observational and analytic study, of 44 newborn infants with cleft lip and palate and their controls, in 33,461 consecutive births, with 20 weeks or more, and birth weight more than 500 g, since November of 1988 to June of 1991. The information were obtained from the database of the Congenital External Malformation Register, done by the University of Guadalajara, in four hospitals. The prevalence of the cleft lip and palate was calculated. Of the variables studied their association was searched with congenital malformation in 2 x 2 tables, calculating, its chi square, confidence interval, and old ratio. RESULTS: The prevalence of the cleft lip and palate was of 13.2 x 10,000 births. By categories: cleft lip 2.7 x 10,000, cleft lip and palate 7.8 x 10,000 and cleft palate 2.7 x 10,000. The only statistics differences with control group were the association with antecedent of other malformation in the family and methrorrague during pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: The found prevalence is similar to the one informed in the literature, with some differences by categories. The association with antecedent of another malformation in the family, support the role of the hereditary role in the multifactorial etiology."
18817572,"Centronuclear myopathy (CNM) is an inherited neuromuscular disorder characterised by clinical features of a congenital myopathy and centrally placed nuclei on muscle biopsy.The incidence of X-linked myotubular myopathy is estimated at 2/100000 male births but epidemiological data for other forms are not currently available.The clinical picture is highly variable. The X-linked form usually gives rise to a severe phenotype in males presenting at birth with marked weakness and hypotonia, external ophthalmoplegia and respiratory failure. Signs of antenatal onset comprise reduced foetal movements, polyhydramnios and thinning of the ribs on chest radiographs; birth asphyxia may be the present. Affected infants are often macrosomic, with length above the 90th centile and large head circumference. Testes are frequently undescended. Both autosomal-recessive (AR) and autosomal-dominant (AD) forms differ from the X-linked form regarding age at onset, severity, clinical characteristics and prognosis. In general, AD forms have a later onset and milder course than the X-linked form, and the AR form is intermediate in both respects.Mutations in the myotubularin (MTM1) gene on chromosome Xq28 have been identified in the majority of patients with the X-linked recessive form, whilst AD and AR forms have been associated with mutations in the dynamin 2 (DNM2) gene on chromosome 19p13.2 and the amphiphysin 2 (BIN1) gene on chromosome 2q14, respectively. Single cases with features of CNM have been associated with mutations in the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (RYR1) and the hJUMPY (MTMR14) genes.Diagnosis is based on typical histopathological findings on muscle biopsy in combination with suggestive clinical features; muscle magnetic resonance imaging may complement clinical assessment and inform genetic testing in cases with equivocal features. Genetic counselling should be offered to all patients and families in whom a diagnosis of CNM has been made.The main differential diagnoses include congenital myotonic dystrophy and other conditions with severe neonatal hypotonia.Management of CNM is mainly supportive, based on a multidisciplinary approach. Whereas the X-linked form due to MTM1 mutations is often fatal in infancy, dominant forms due to DNM2 mutations and some cases of the recessive BIN1-related form appear to be associated with an overall more favourable prognosis."
8330454,"A genetic epidemiologic analysis of early onset cerebellar ataxias (EOCA) with retained tendon reflexes was performed in a defined area of Northwestern Italy. Forty cases diagnosed from 1940 to 1990 were ascertained. The ascertainment probability was 85.7%. The segregation analysis (Weinberg's proband method and 'singles' method under incomplete ascertainment) is compatible with autosomal recessive inheritance. The point prevalence ratio was 1.0/100,000 population. The birth incidence rate was 1/48,000 live births. Gene frequency was estimated to be 1/218. The ratio of first-cousin marriages among parents of EOCA (4.5%) was lower than expected using Dahlberg's formula (8.9%)."
23983119,"To describe the epidemiology of primary Sjögren's syndrome (SS) in a multiracial/multiethnic population.A cross-sectional study with 5 case-retrieval sources identified adults with primary SS living in the Greater Paris area (population 1,172,482 adults) in 2007. Diagnoses were verified by the American-European Consensus Group (AECG) criteria and study-specific enlarged criteria based on the presence of ≥3 of 4 AECG items among subjective oral or ocular dryness, anti-SSA/SSB positivity, and positive minor salivary gland biopsy results. Prevalence estimates were standardized to those for the world population and a 5-source capture-recapture analysis (CRA) was used. Racial/ethnic differences in primary SS features were evaluated.In all, 133 subjects met the AECG criteria and 203 met the enlarged criteria. The 2007 prevalence of primary SS was 1.02 cases per 10,000 adults (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.85-1.22) for the AECG criteria and 1.52 cases per 10,000 adults (95% CI 1.30-1.76) for the enlarged criteria. The CRA indicated completeness of case findings of ∼90%. Compared to subjects with European backgrounds, those with non-European backgrounds had 2.1-2.3 times higher primary SS prevalence and were younger (P < 0.0001) and were more likely to have polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia (P < 0.0001) and anti-SSA/SSB antibodies (P = 0.0005 and P < 0.0001 for the AECG and enlarged criteria, respectively).The figure of 1.02–1.52 cases per 10,000 adults we found and estimates from the few other population-based census surveys support that the prevalence of diagnosed primary SS is between 1 and 9 cases per 10,000 (0.01-0.09%) [corrected] in the general population. Non-European race/ethnicity may be associated with increased primary SS risk and a distinct disease profile."
27786368,"The association between sarcoidosis and autoimmune comorbidities has been reported, however, it has seldom been confirmed by a large nationwide study. Our study aimed to clarify the association between sarcoidosis and autoimmune comorbidities in the Taiwanese. A total of 1237 patients with sarcoidosis and 4948 age- and sex-matched control subjects were selected from the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan from 1997 to 2010. Multiple logistic regressions were performed to calculate the odds of comorbidities between the two groups. The prevalence of sarcoidosis was 2.17/100 000 individuals in Taiwan. Sarcoidosis patients tended to run a higher risk of autoimmune comorbidities than the control group (17.6% vs 9.4%, P < 0.05). Autoimmune thyroid disease (adjusted odd ratio [aOR], 1.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05-1.64), Sjögren's syndrome (aOR, 11.6; 95% CI, 4.36-31.0) and ankylosing spondylitis (aOR, 3.80; 95% CI, 2.42-5.97) were significantly associated with sarcoidosis. The sex-stratified analyses were carried out to demonstrate a significant association of sarcoidosis with ankylosing spondylitis in both sexes, but with autoimmune thyroid disease in male patients and with Sjögren's syndrome female patients, respectively. Besides, the diagnosis of the autoimmune comorbidities strongly associated with sarcoidosis tended to be established after that of sarcoidosis. This study demonstrated that patients with sarcoidosis tended to have autoimmune thyroid disease, Sjögren's syndrome and ankylosing spondylitis, and the diagnosis of sarcoidosis usually preceded that of associated comorbidities. Clinicians should be alert to autoimmune comorbidities in patients with sarcoidosis."
23974201,"In pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML), cytogenetic abnormalities are strong indicators of prognosis. Some recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities, such as t(8;16)(p11;p13), are so rare that collaborative studies are required to define their prognostic impact. We collected the clinical characteristics, morphology, and immunophenotypes of 62 pediatric AML patients with t(8;16)(p11;p13) from 18 countries participating in the International Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster (I-BFM) AML study group. We used the AML-BFM cohort diagnosed from 1995-2005 (n = 543) as a reference cohort. Median age of the pediatric t(8;16)(p11;p13) AML patients was significantly lower (1.2 years). The majority (97%) had M4-M5 French-American-British type, significantly different from the reference cohort. Erythrophagocytosis (70%), leukemia cutis (58%), and disseminated intravascular coagulation (39%) occurred frequently. Strikingly, spontaneous remissions occurred in 7 neonates with t(8;16)(p11;p13), of whom 3 remain in continuous remission. The 5-year overall survival of patients diagnosed after 1993 was 59%, similar to the reference cohort (P = .14). Gene expression profiles of t(8;16)(p11;p13) pediatric AML cases clustered close to, but distinct from, MLL-rearranged AML. Highly expressed genes included HOXA11, HOXA10, RET, PERP, and GGA2. In conclusion, pediatric t(8;16)(p11;p13) AML is a rare entity defined by a unique gene expression signature and distinct clinical features in whom spontaneous remissions occur in a subset of neonatal cases."
12934793,"The Genetic Blood Disorders Survey is the first community-based survey in the Arabic world and the Middle East to determine the prevalence of the most common genetic blood disorders. The objective of the survey was to determine the prevalence of the most common genetic blood disorders reported among Omani children under 5 years of age in order to provide the planners and policy-makers with reliable information suitable for formulating health policies, planning, and evaluation. The survey was designed, executed, and financed by the Ministry of Health of the Sultanate of Oman. To reduce costs and save effort and time, data collection for the survey was implemented with the Gulf Family Health Survey (GFHS). The GFHS in the Sultanate of Oman is a research project undertaken by the Council of Health Ministers of the Gulf Co-operation Council States. The six member countries have participated in this GFHS project. A total of 6103 households were interviewed. From these households 6342 children under 5 years of age were taken by their parents to neighbourhood hospitals or health centres for blood collection. Fifty-one per cent of the sample were male and 49 per cent were female. Among the child respondents, 17.9 per cent were in the age group 0 to < 1 year, 20.3 per cent were in the age group 1 to < 2 years, 21.1 per cent were in the age group 2 to < 3 years, 20.5 per cent were in the age group 3 to < 4 years, and 20.2 per cent were in the age group 4 to 5 years. Fifty-five per cent of the mothers of the children studied were illiterate, 9 per cent could read and write but had less than primary education, 20 per cent had completed primary school, 9 per cent had attended preparatory school, 5 per cent had attended secondary school, 1 per cent had had intermediate education, while 0.6 per cent had completed university or higher education. The results of this survey revealed that haemoglobinopathies are prevalent in Oman; the prevalence of sickle cell trait was 6 per cent, and of beta-thalassaemia 2 per cent. The prevalence of sickle cell and homozygous beta-thalassaemia were 0.2 and 0.07 per cent, respectively. Other abnormal haemoglobins (Hb) have been detected in this survey; HbD (0.6 per cent), HbE (0.3 per cent), HbC (0.02 per cent). Combination of sickle cell with other abnormal Hb was also detected at low prevalence. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) enzyme deficiency had a high prevalence in Oman, being 25 per cent in males and 10 per cent in females. Among the children studied, three-quarters (74.5 per cent) were found to be free from haemoglobinopathies and G6PD normal, the rest (25.5 per cent), either had haemoglobinopathies (7.5 per cent), G6PD deficiency (16 per cent) or a combination of G6PD deficiency with at least one abnormal Hb (2 per cent). The prevalence of total haemoglobinopathies in Oman was 9.5 per cent. The prevalence of sickle cell trait varied between regions, North Sharqiya had the highest prevalence of 10 per cent. Dakhiliya (9 per cent), followed by Muscat and South Batinah 8 and 7.9 per cent, respectively. The prevalence of sickle cell trait declined by a half in Musandam, South Sharqiya, Dhahira, and North Batinah (4.7, 3.9, 3.9, and 2.9 per cent respectively). Dhofar had the lowest prevalence of 0.2 per cent and no cases of sickle cell trait were found in the Al-Wousta region in the sample selected. The prevalence of beta-thalassaemia trait ranged from 3.9 to 0.2 per cent. Three regions had high rates: North Batinah (3.9 per cent), Muscat (2.8 per cent), and Dakhiliya (2 per cent). The other five regions in the Sultanate have lower rates: Dhahira (1.7 per cent), Musandam (1.6 per cent), South Batinah (1.5 per cent), South Sharqiya (1.2 per cent), and North Sharqiya (1.1 per cent). The prevalence of beta-thalassaemia trait in Dhofar was 0.2 per cent and no cases were detected in the Al-Wousta region. The prevalence of G6PD deficiency reached 29 per cent in Dakhiliya, 26 per cent in South Batinah, 21 per cent in Dhahira, 19 per cent in Muscat and 17 per cent in North Sharqiya and North Batinah. The prevalence declined to 10 per cent in Musandam, 9 per cent in South Sharqiya, Dhofar had the lowest prevalence of 2 per cent and no cases of G6PD deficiency were found in Al-Wousta. The male to female ratio was 2.5:1. In all regions of the Sultanate, prevalence of G6PD deficiency in males were more than twice those in females. From the above rates, it could be calculated that in the whole Sultanate 44,733 children under 5 years of age have G6PD deficiency, 14,306 have sickle cell trait, 474 have sickle cell disease, 5393 have beta-thalassaemia trait, and 175 have beta-thalassaemia major. The study showed that the mean Hb level of children under 5 years of age was 10.9 g/dl for both males and females; the mean Hb level for males was 10.89 g/dl and for females 10.99 g/dl, the difference between males and females was significant. The study revealed that half of the children under 5 years of age were anaemic. Mild anaemia was predominant (46 per cent), while moderate and severe anaemia were 4 and 0.2 per cent respectively. The status of anaemia among children improved with age; mild anaemia was prevalent in 65 per cent of children between ages 0 to < or = 1 years then decreased with age until it reached 30 per cent at 4-5 years of age. The survey produced the first normal haematological indices for children under 5 years of age to be used as a reference in the country. The blood picture of the normal subjects in the survey showed that the mean Hb value for males was 11.9 g/dl and for females 11.8 g/dl. The children had reduced values of MCH and MCV compared to normal international values, the reason for this could be alpha-thalassaemia or iron deficiency. The children maintained high values of HbF (more than 1.2 per cent) even after their first birthday. HbF reached its normal level at 5 years of age. Marriage of first cousins among the parents of the children studied under 5 years of age was 34 per cent. Total consanguinity rate including second cousin relationships and beyond was 58 per cent. We recommend that a national prevention programme for genetic blood disorders be formulated by the authorities. The programme could be included in the Ministry of Health 5-year health development programme for prevention of non-communicable diseases which already exists."
17638193,"BACKGROUND: The incidence and severity of invasive group A streptococcal infection demonstrate great variability over time, which at least, in part, seems to be related to group A streptococcal type distribution among the human population. METHODS: An enhanced surveillance study of invasive group A streptococcal infection (746 isolates) was performed in Sweden from April 2002 through December 2004. Noninvasive isolates from either the throat or skin (773 isolates) were collected in parallel for comparison. Clinical and epidemiological data were obtained from 88% of patients with invasive disease and were related to isolate characteristics, including T type, emm sequence type, and the presence of 9 superantigen genes, as well as pulsed-field gel electrophoresis pattern comparisons of selected isolates. RESULTS: The annual incidence was 3.0 cases per 100,000 population. Among the patients with invasive disease, 11% developed streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, and 9.5% developed necrotizing fasciitis. The overall case-fatality rate was 14.5%, and 39% of the patients with streptococcal toxic shock syndrome died (P<.001). The T3/13/B3264 cluster accounted for 33% of invasive and 25% of noninvasive isolates. Among this most prevalent type cluster, emm types 89 and 81 dominated. Combined results from pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, emm typing, and superantigen gene profiling identified subgroups within specific emm types that are significantly more prone to cause invasive disease than were other isolates of the same type. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed a changing epidemiology of invasive group A streptococcal infection in Sweden, with emergence of new emm types that were previously not described. The results also suggest that some clones may be particularly prone to cause invasive disease."
31241292,"OBJECTIVES:Presymptomatic detection of patients with rare diseases (RD), defined by a population frequency less than 1 : 2,000, is the task of newborn screening (NBS). In the Czech Republic (CZ), currently eighteen RD are screened: phenylketonuria/hyperphenylalaninemia (PKU/HPA), congenital hypothyroidism (CH), congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), cystic fibrosis (CF), medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD), long chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (LCHADD), very long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (VLCADD), carnitine palmitoyl transferase I and II deficiency (CPTID, CPTIID), carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase deficiency (CACTD), maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), glutaric aciduria type I (GA I), isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (IVA), argininemia (ARG), citrullinemia (CIT), biotinidase deficiency (BTD), cystathionine beta-synthase-deficient homocystinuria (CBSD HCU), and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency homocystinuria (MTHFRD HCU). The aim was to analyze the prevalence of RD screened by NBS in CZ. METHODS:We examined the NBS programme in CZ from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2017, which covered 888,891 neonates. Dried blood spots were primarily analyzed using fluorescence immuno-assay, tandem mass spectrometry and fluorimetry. RESULTS:The overall prevalence of RD among the neonate cohort was 1 : 1,043. Individually, 1 : 2,877 for CH, 1 : 5,521 for PKU/HPA, 1 : 6,536 for CF (1 : 5,887 including false negative patients), 1 : 12,520 for CAH, 1 : 22,222 for MCADD, 1 : 80,808 for LCHADD, 1 : 177,778 for GA I, 1 : 177,778 for IVA, 1 : 222,223 for VLCADD, 1 : 296,297 for MSUD, 1 : 8,638 for BTD, and 1 : 181,396 for CBSD HCU. CONCLUSIONS:The observed prevalence of RD, based on NBS, corresponds to that expected, more precisely it was higher for BTD and lower for MSUD, IVA, CBSD HCU, MCADD and VLCADD. Early detection of rare diseases by means of NBS is an effective secondary prevention tool."
20209839,"BACKGROUND: The mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) are a devastating heterogenous group of lysosomal storage disorders. AIM: To evaluate the epidemiological profile of MPS in Tunisia. METHODS: we conducted a retrospective epidemiological survey covering the period 1970-2005. Multiple sources were used to identify affected patients. RESULTS: Ninety six confirmed MPS cases were collected from 132 suspected cases found in the surveyed data. Of the ninety six confirmed cases, 20% were from multiplex families. Consanguinity was found in 83% of the families. The crude rate for all types of mucopolysaccharidoses was 2.3 cases in 100,000 live births. The prevalence of MPS type I, III and IV, those most frequently occurring in the collected data, were estimated at 0.63, 0.7 and 0.45 per 100,000 live births, respectively. The cumulative incidence of MPS type VI (0.3 per 105 live births) was higher than reported in European countries; but, it is likely that... CONCLUSION: The reported frequency of all types of MPS in Tunisia is underestimated."
19419768,"Primary immunodeficiency disorders are a recognized public health problem worldwide. The prototype of these conditions is X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) or Bruton's disease. XLA is caused by mutations in Bruton's tyrosine kinase gene (BTK), preventing B cell development and resulting in the almost total absence of serum immunoglobulins. The genetic profile and prevalence of XLA have not previously been studied in Eastern and Central European (ECE) countries. We studied the genetic and demographic features of XLA in Belarus, Croatia Hungary, Poland, Republic of Macedonia, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovenia, and Ukraine. We collected clinical, immunological, and genetic information for 122 patients from 109 families. The BTK gene was sequenced from the genomic DNA of patients with a high susceptibility to infection, almost no CD19(+) peripheral blood B cells, and low or undetectable levels of serum immunoglobulins M, G, and A, compatible with a clinical and immunological diagnosis of XLA. BTK sequence analysis revealed 98 different mutations, 46 of which are reported for the first time here. The mutations included single nucleotide changes in the coding exons (35 missense and 17 nonsense), 23 splicing defects, 13 small deletions, 7 large deletions, and 3 insertions. The mutations were scattered throughout the BTK gene and most frequently concerned the SH1 domain; no missense mutation was detected in the SH3 domain. The prevalence of XLA in ECE countries (total population 145,530,870) was found to be 1 per 1,399,000 individuals. This report provides the first comprehensive overview of the molecular genetic and demographic features of XLA in Eastern and Central Europe."
15781811,"BACKGROUND: Large-scale mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletions are associated with clinical conditions such as Kearns-Sayre syndrome and chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia in adults and Pearson syndrome in children. Reported case series have suggested that deletions are not uncommon in the population, but their prevalence has not been documented. METHODS: The authors ascertained patients with clinical features associated with mtDNA deletions in a defined adult population in northern Finland. Buccal epithelial samples were requested from each patient fulfilling the selection criteria, and full-length mtDNA was amplified using the long PCR method. Deletion breakpoints were identified using sequencing. Patients with deletions were examined clinically. RESULTS: The authors identified four patients with single large-scale mtDNA deletions. The prevalence of deletions was calculated to be 1.6/100,000 in the adult population in the province of Northern Ostrobothnia (0.0 to 3.2; 95% CI). Analysis of incident cases from a neighboring province revealed two patients with deletions and yielded a similar population frequency. CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of large-scale mitochondrial DNA deletions is similar among populations, suggesting that there is a constant rate of new deletions."
9714114,"BACKGROUND: Fetal echocardiography is widely established in the United Kingdom for prenatal diagnosis of congenital heart disease. This may result in a substantial reduction in incidence at birth because of selected termination of pregnancy. The objective of this population-based study was to determine the incidence of pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum (PAIVS) at birth, the impact of fetal echocardiography on this incidence, and to compare the outcome of cases with and those without prenatal diagnosis. METHODS AND RESULTS: From 1991 to 1995, all infants born with PAIVS and all fetal diagnoses in the United Kingdom and Eire were studied. There were 183 live births (incidence 4.5/100,000 live births). The incidence was 4.1 cases per 100,000 live births in England and Wales, 4.7 in Scotland, 6.8 in Eire, and 9.6 in Northern Ireland (P=0.01). There were 86 fetal diagnoses made at a mean of 22.0 weeks of gestation leading to 53 terminations of pregnancy (61%), 4 intrauterine deaths (5%), and 29 live births (34%). The incidence at birth would be 5.6 per 100,000 births in England and Wales, 5.3 in Scotland, and unchanged in Eire and Northern Ireland, if there were no terminations of pregnancy and assuming no further spontaneous fetal deaths (P=0.28). An initial diagnosis of critical pulmonary stenosis was made in 6 cases, at a mean of 22.3 weeks of gestation with progression to PAIVS by 31.4 weeks. Probability of survival at 1 year was 65% and was the same for live-born infants whether or not a fetal diagnosis had been made. CONCLUSIONS: PAIVS is rare, occurring in 1 in 22,000 live births in the United Kingdom and Eire. Termination of pregnancy has resulted in an important reduction in the live-born incidence in mainland Britain."
15166842,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW:Acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are diseases with a significant influence in the public health. A better knowledge of their epidemiology could help to improve the outcome of these diseases. RECENT FINDINGS:Although the clinical criteria of the American-European Consensus Conference definitions for ALI and ARDS are simple, there is a risk of misclassification due to a poor reliability. Except for new emerging infectious diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, the etiology of ALI/ARDS has remained the same for several years. The only recent innovation is the hypothesis that pulmonary ARDS and extrapulmonary ARDS could be different clinical entities. In recent years, there has been a special interest in the study of genetic predisposition to development ALI/ARDS. Recent studies have estimated the incidence of these diseases to be between 15 and 34 cases per 100,000 inhabitants per year. This wide range could stem from differences in the methodology used to calculate the incidence or could be a true variation due to regional differences. Mortality rate of ALI/ARDS have remained steady for several years. Respiratory failure is the cause of the death in less than 20% of the patients. SUMMARY:The epidemiology of ALI and ARDS has some issues to improve, such as the accuracy of the clinical criteria of ALI/ARDS. Future research must to include study of genetic polymorphisms of the mediators involve in the development of ALI/ARDS. Studies to define better the population at risk are necessary to estimate better their true incidence."
11360093,"OBJECTIVES: A national register of symptomatic hemoglobinopathies has been developed in Oman to facilitate the development of the National Program for the control of genetic blood disorders. METHODS: The information was initially collected retrospectively through hospital records and was refined prospectively with data collected through a survey of pediatricians. The percentages of heterozygotes in different population groups and geographical locations, birth prevalence, age distribution of cases and factors determining frequencies of Hemoglobinopathies in different regions of the country were studied from the register. RESULTS: The register has identified 1757 cases of homozygous Sickle Cell Anemia and 243 cases of beta-thalassemia major in a population of 1.5 million in 1995. Register based national figures of heterozygote carriers approximate 10% for Sickle Cell Anemia and 4% for beta-thalassemia major. CONCLUSION: Defining regional and tribal variations can assist efficient targeting of health resources. This approach provides a simple model for other countries or regions to follow providing there is a health care system that facilitates registration."
10798084,"Permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus (PNIDDM) is a rare form of IDDM with unclear etiology and pathogenesis. We determined the incidence and prevalence rates and studied the clinical and biochemical features of PNIDDM in the Sultanate of Oman. The mean incidence rate during the study period from January 1989 to December 1994 was 1.788 +/- 0.82 per 100,000 live births per year. At the end of December 1994 the prevalence rate was 2.4 per 100,000 children below the age of 5 years. They constituted 41.6% of all cases of IDDM in this age group. Diarrhoea, fever, lethargy, poor feeding and failure to thrive were the most common presenting symptoms. Dehydration and tachypnoea were the most common signs. All patients who developed IDDM during the neonatal period had intrauterine growth retardation and 4.5 presented with diabetic ketoacidosis (plasma glucose 37 +/- 9 mmol/L, pH 7.12 +/- 0.1). Hypertriglyceridemia was a constant feature (19.4 +/- 4.8 mmol/L). They were products of consanguineous marriage with significantly high prevalence of IDDM and NIDDM in their family members. None of the infants had clinical or immunological evidence of congenital viral infection. Three of the five children had HLA-DR2, the diabetes resistance alleles. C-peptide secretion was absent during and after metabolic control of hyperglycemia in all the studied infants and none had circulating islet cell antibody at presentation or during the first year after diagnosis. Despite marked growth retardation at birth, there was a significant improvement of growth after initiating insulin therapy. Four of the 5 patients had normal developmental milestones, one had mild developmental delay following a severe and prolonged attack of hypoglycemia. None of the patients had exocrine pancreatic deficiency. In summary, the very high rate of parental consanguinity, occurrence in both sexes and in two siblings in the same family, absence of islet cell antibodies and the presence of HLA-DR2 loci in 3/5 of patients suggest that PNIDDM is a different disease process to standard IDDM in childhood and an autosomal recessive mode of transmission."
21164269,"Primary adrenocortical insufficiency, or Addison's disease (AD), results from an adrenal cortex hypofunction/dysfunction with a deficient production of glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids and androgens, and with high levels of both ACTH and plasma renin activity. The prevalence of AD is 110-144 cases per million population in the developed countries. Autoimmune AD is the most frequent etiological form in adult patients, accounting for about 80% of cases, followed by post-tuberculosis AD in 10-15%, the remaining 5% being cases are due to vascular, neoplastic or rare genetic forms. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia is the most frequent form of AD in children and accounts for 72% of cases, whereas autoimmune AD is seen in around 10-15% of cases. The markers of autoimmune AD are adrenal cortex (ACA) or 21-hydroxylase autoantibodies (21-OHAbs) and they are present at diagnosis in more than 90% of cases. In autoimmune AD, the adrenal cortex is infiltrated by lymphocytes and plasma cells and the glands are sclerotic and reduced in volume. Autoimmune AD occurs mainly in middle-aged females, alone or associated with other (clinical, subclinical or potential) autoimmune diseases, giving rise to various forms of autoimmune polyglandular syndrome (type 1, 2 or 4). Replacement therapy with gluco-and mineralocorticoids is life-saving for patients with chronic adrenal insufficiency."
9286459,"Through a survey of all departments of pediatrics, neurology and neuropathology in Germany, we calculated the incidence of all major forms of leukodystrophy. Only diagnoses based on specific biochemical tests in association with typical findings and/or neuroradiologically proven white matter involvement were accepted. In accordance with these strict criteria, 617 cases of leukodystrophy were found (incidence of all forms: app. 2.0/100,000). Minimal incidence was estimated at 0.8/100,000 for adrenoleukodystrophy/adrenomyeloneuropathy (ALD/AMN), 0.6/100,000 for metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD), and 0.6/100,000 for Krabbe disease. Thus ALD/AMN is apparently underdiagnosed in Germany. A considerable proportion of leukodystrophies could not be classified in spite of adequate diagnostic procedures in experienced centers."
29321229,"OBJECTIVE:To investigate the incidence of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) and patient characteristics in Sweden between 1988 and 2013. METHODS:All PML diagnoses in Sweden between 1988 and 2013 were identified in the National Patient Register. Information to validate the diagnosis and patient characteristics was obtained from medical records. RESULTS:Medical record review classified 108 out of 250 patients (43%) as definite (n = 84), probable (n = 4), or possible (n = 20) PML according to diagnostic criteria. Accurate diagnoses were more common in records obtained from neurology departments (82% of patients seen in neurology departments) compared with other departments (31%) (p < 0.001). The incidence of PML increased from a largely stable level at 0.026 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.021-0.031) per 100,000 individuals per year during 1988-2010 to 0.11 (95% CI 083-0.137) during 2011-2013, during which time there was a notable increase (p < 0.001). Hematologic malignancies (n = 34), HIV/AIDS (n = 33), and autoimmune disease (n = 23) were the most common underlying diseases. Treatment with a monoclonal antibody prior to PML diagnosis was identified in 26 patients. CONCLUSION:An increased incidence of PML in Sweden was observed and coincided with the prior use of monoclonal antibody treatment. The high level of misdiagnosis emphasizes the importance of immediate contact with a neurology center upon suspicion of PML."
11400774,"A newborn screening program for congenital hypothyroidism (CH) and phenylketonuria (PKU), a pilot study, was initiated at the Medical Genetics Unit, Department of Pediatrics, Siriraj Hospital Faculty of Medicine, Mahidol University in Bangkok, Thailand from January 1994 to December 1998, using dried blood spots (DBS). A total of 18,739 infants (out of 85,150 livebirths) were screened (22 % coverage). Three cases of congenital hypothyroidism (CH) were identified (incidence of 1: 6,246, livebirths), by enzyme linked immunosorbent (ELISA) and fluoroimmunoassays using a cut-off level of TSH >20 microlU/ml: the recall rate of 0.24%. The screening for PKU was done by fluorometric (Guthrie) and enzyme linked immunosorbent (ELISA) methods; using cut-off levels of phenylalanine > 4 mg/dl and > 3.6 mg/dl respectively, with a recall rate of 0.13%. There was no PKU found. Our study, a voluntary program, emphasizes the importance of parental education and consent; specimen collection and handling; appropriate follow-up and referral to specialists for treatment and counseling. Routine newborn screening for CH and PKU is being established to ascertain the maximum coverage, using recommendations and guidelines from this pilot study."
16821272,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence, prevalence, and principal characteristics of the different forms of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) in the region of Alsace, northeastern France, using the new classification of the International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR). METHODS: In 2002 we performed a retrospective epidemiologic study pertaining to the year 2001. The pediatricians, rheumatologists, ophthalmologists, orthopedic surgeons, and physicians involved in functional reeducation in the Alsace region were interviewed, and all patients were classified according to the new ILAR classification using the criteria revised in Durban in 1997. RESULTS: Among the 361 clinicians contacted, the participation rate was 97.8%. The study identified 67 children followed for JIA in Alsace in 2001, from a total population of 1.8 million inhabitants including 339,095 children under age 16 years. The incidence was calculated to be 3.2 cases/100,000/year and the prevalence 19.8 cases/100,000 children under age 16 years. Among these 67 cases of JIA, the most frequent forms were oligoarthritis (n = 27, 40.3%), polyarthritis without rheumatoid factor (RF; n = 15, 22.4%), and enthesitis related arthritis (n = 12, 17.9%). Other forms, notably systemic arthritis (n = 6, 8.9%) and psoriatic arthritis (n = 3, 4.5%), were more rare and in this study there was no case of polyarthritis with RF. Only 4 patients (6%) were classified in the undifferentiated arthritis group using the new classification. Antinuclear antibodies (ANA; by indirect immunofluorescence, HEp >/= 1/80) were detected in patients with oligoarthritis (81%) and polyarthritis without RF (79%). Uveitis occurred in 41% of children with oligoarthritis and in 14% of those with polyarthritis without RF. CONCLUSION: Our results are comparable to those of other studies carried out in Caucasian populations with regard to incidence and prevalence. This work also highlights the frequent presence of ANA and uveitis in patients with oligoarthritis or polyarthritis without RF."
18603627,"Trichothiodystrophy (TTD) is a rare, autosomal recessive disease, characterised by brittle, sulfur deficient hair and multisystem abnormalities. A systematic literature review identified 112 patients ranging from 12 weeks to 47 years of age (median 6 years). In addition to hair abnormalities, common features reported were developmental delay/intellectual impairment (86%), short stature (73%), ichthyosis (65%), abnormal characteristics at birth (55%), ocular abnormalities (51%), infections (46%), photosensitivity (42%), maternal pregnancy complications (28%) and defective DNA repair (37%). There was high mortality, with 19 deaths under the age of 10 years (13 infection related), which is 20-fold higher compared to the US population. The spectrum of clinical features varied from mild disease with only hair involvement to severe disease with profound developmental defects, recurrent infections and a high mortality at a young age. Abnormal characteristics at birth and pregnancy complications, unrecognised but common features of TTD, suggest a role for DNA repair genes in normal fetal development."
17457484,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence of the asymptomatic thyroglossal duct anomalies and to review the literature and make comments on the significance of this condition. METHODS: A total of 80 cadavers were dissected in the present study. This study was carried out during 2005, where the cadavers were randomly included from the criminal laboratories of the Ministry of Justice, Republic of Turkey in Istanbul. None of the cadavers had laryngeal and cervical injuries resulting from a trauma or the cause of their death. The examined cadavers included 59 men and 21 females, and their age were ranged from 35-80 years old. The larynges were removed and fixed in 10% formalin and then dissected. The sections were examined using surgical SMZ 10 Nikon stereomicroscope. We evaluated the presence, localization, and diameter of the cysts with regard to age and sex of the cadavers. RESULTS: We observed a total of 12 different localization of thyroglossal ducts and cysts among the dissected 80 cadavers. Ten of these ducts cysts were found in males with an age range of 35-68 years and 2 in female cadavers aged 46-65 years. In 6 cases, the thyroglossal ducts and cysts were located in the left of the midline of the neck, while 3 cases were from the right of the midline, and the remaining was located on the midline of the neck. In all cases, thyroglossal ducts and cysts were complete and restricted to the infrahyoid region; all of them had connection with the hyoid bone, but not with the perichondrium of the cartilage. In addition, the thyroglossal ducts had connection with the left lobe of the thyroid glands in 3 cases, one case in the right lobe, and 2 cases with the isthmus of the thyroid gland. Finally, in 5 cases thyroglossal ducts were complete and had well-developed cysts. CONCLUSION: Thyroglossal duct remnants are one of the most often seen congenital asymptomatic masses of the neck region (7%). The presence of these duct remnants may lead to abnormal phonation and epithelial carcinomas. Therefore, correlation of the rate of thyroglossal duct remnants in a population together with the related clinical symptoms can lead to an early diagnosis and better treatment chances for these problems."
16968795,"CONTEXT: Prevalence data are important for assessing the burden of disease on the health care system; data on pituitary adenoma prevalence are very scarce. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to measure the prevalence of clinically relevant pituitary adenomas in a well-defined population. DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional, intensive, case-finding study performed in three regions of the province of Liège, Belgium, to measure pituitary adenoma prevalence as of September 30, 2005. SETTING: The study was conducted in specialist and general medical practitioner patient populations, referral hospitals, and investigational centers. METHODS: Three demographically and geographically distinct districts of the province of Liège were delineated precisely using postal codes. Medical practitioners in these districts were recruited, and patients with pituitary adenomas under their care were identified. Diagnoses were confirmed after retrieval of clinical, hormonal, radiological, and pathological data; full demographic and therapeutic follow-up data were collected in all cases. RESULTS: Sixty-eight patients with clinically relevant pituitary adenomas were identified in a population of 71,972 individuals; the mean (+/- sd) prevalence was 94 +/- 19.3 cases per 100,000 population (95% confidence interval, 72.2 to 115.8). The group was 67.6% female and had a mean age at diagnosis of 40.3 yr; 42.6% had macroadenomas and 55.9% underwent surgery. Prolactinomas comprised 66% of the group, with the rest having nonsecreting tumors (14.7%), somatotropinomas (13.2%), or Cushing's disease (5.9%); 20.6% had hypopituitarism. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of pituitary adenomas in the study population (one case in 1064 individuals) was more than 3.5-5 times that previously reported. This increased prevalence may have important implications when prioritizing funding for research and treatment of pituitary adenomas."
9371909,"Information on the incidence of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is limited; incidence rates for multiple system atrophy (MSA) are not available. We studied the incidence of PSP and MSA in Olmsted County, Minnesota, for the years 1976 to 1990. This study was part of a larger investigation of all forms of parkinsonism. We used the medical records-linkage system of the Rochester Epidemiology Project to identify all subjects whose records contained documentation of any from of parkinsonism, related neurodegenerative diseases, or tremor of any type. A nurse abstractor screened the records and, when applicable, a neurologist reviewed them to determine the presence or absence of parkinsonism. Cases of parkinsonism were classified using specified diagnostic criteria. Population denominators were derived from census data and were corrected by removing prevalent cases of parkinsonism. Over the 15 years of the study, we found 16 incident cases of PSP and nine incident cases of MSA. No cases of PSP or MSA had onset before age 50 years. The average annual incidence rate (new cases per 100,000 person-years) for ages 50 to 99 years was 5.3 for PSP and 3.0 for MSA. The incidence of PSP increased steeply with age from 1.7 at 50 to 59 years to 14.7 at 80 to 99 years, and was consistently higher in men. Median survival time from symptom onset was 5.3 years for PSP and 8.5 years for MSA. The incidence of PSP increases with age and is consistently higher in men at all ages. PSP and MSA are more common than previously recognized."
15846586,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the incidence and prevalence, as well as the mortality and survival rates, of systemic sclerosis (SSc) in a defined area of northwest Greece with a population of about 500,000 inhabitants. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cases have been recorded from the following sources: (1) inpatients and outpatients referred to the Rheumatology Clinics of the Ioannina University Hospital and the Ioannina General Hospital; (2) patients referred to the private rheumatologists practicing in the study area. All patients recorded between 1/1/1981 and 31/12/2002, resident in the study area, were included in the study. Diagnosis was based on the American College of Rheumatology classification criteria for SSc. Incidence and prevalence rates were calculated as number of cases per 10(5) inhabitants. Population data were based on the National Census of 1981, 1991, and 2001. RESULTS: The age-adjusted prevalence of SSc was 15.40 cases/10(5) inhabitants on 31/12/2002. A total of 109 new cases were diagnosed during the study period, giving a mean annual age-adjusted incidence rate of 1.10 cases/10 5 inhabitants. There were 98 women and 11 men, giving a ratio of 8.9/1. Limited SSc was diagnosed in 75% and diffuse in 25% of the patients. Esophageal involvement was found in 59%, lung involvement in 56%, and renal disease in 5%. Thirty-six deaths were recorded during the study period in this incidence cohort. The 5-year survival rate was 83% and the 10-year survival rate was 70%. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence and prevalence of SSc in northwest Greece were found to be lower than those of the USA and Australia, and higher than those of northern European countries and Japan. The survival rates were similar to those reported by other studies."
17539838,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to better understand the epidemiological and clinical features of patients with sarcoidosis in Singapore and to ascertain if ethnic differences exist. METHODS: A review of hospital medical records from June 1998 to May 2004 to identify patients with sarcoidosis. RESULTS: There were 59 patients with sarcoidosis identified (19 Chinese, 29 Asian Indian and 11 Malay). The estimated annual incidence of sarcoidosis in Singapore was 0.56 per 100,000. There was a significant difference between the observed and expected disease frequency in Chinese (32.2% vs 78.7%) and Indians (49.2% vs 6.0%, P < 0.005). A bimodal distribution of age at diagnosis was seen with peaks in the 30-39 years and 50-59 years age groups; 38.9% of cases were over the age of 50. Chinese patients were more likely to be asymptomatic (57.9%, P = 0.015) and less likely to have impaired spirometry (P = 0.013). Pulmonary sarcoid presented largely as stage 0 or stage 1 disease (74.4%). Overall mean spirometry was unimpaired and prognosis was good with 79.2% showing no radiological deterioration. There were no significant differences in organ involvement or treatment between ethnic groups. CONCLUSION: Sarcoidosis in Singapore is rare and the incidence differs between ethnic groups. Chinese appear to have a lower incidence and a less symptomatic presentation; Indians have a higher incidence and poorer clinical course."
15313597,"Atresia and stenosis are some of the most common birth defects affecting the small intestine. Few population-based studies have examined the epidemiology of small intestinal atresia/stenosis. Eighty-two cases of small intestinal atresia/stenosis were identified through a population-based birth defects registry in Hawaii during 1986-2000. The relationships of various clinical and demographic factors with small intestinal atresia/stenosis and duodenal atresia/stenosis were examined. The small intestinal atresia/stenosis and duodenal atresia/stenosis rates were 2.9 per 10,000 live births [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.3-3.6] and 1.3 per 10,000 live births (95% CI 1.0-1.9), respectively. No secular trend was observed (P = 0.067 and 0.090, respectively). Maternal age risk for small intestinal atresia/stenosis was U-shaped, while duodenal atresia/stenosis rates were highest with maternal age of 35 years or more. Small intestinal atresia/stenosis was substantially more common among Far East Asians than Caucasians [rate ratio (RR) 1.96, 95% CI 1.24-2.94]. Duodenal atresia/stenosis risk was higher in Hawaii County than in Honolulu County (RR 2.55, 95% CI 1.10-5.02). Small intestinal atresia/stenosis was also associated with low birth weight (RR 11.50, 95% CI 8.05-15.92), low gestational age (RR 8.60, 95% CI 6.34-11.41) and multiple births (RR 3.79, 95% CI 1.39-8.24). In conclusion, this study found associations between small intestinal atresia/stenosis and maternal age, maternal race/ethnicity, county of residence, birth weight, gestational age and plurality, but not delivery period. Many of the associations between small intestinal atresia/stenosis and other factors noted in this investigation were similar to those reported by other studies."
3386818,"We surveyed neurologists and chronic care facilities in and near two New Jersey counties with a combined population of 799,022, regarding cases of progressive supranuclear palsy. All suspected cases were examined personally, using rigid criteria. The prevalence ratio was 1.39/100,000. A total of 50 New Jersey cases yielded median intervals to onset of requiring gait assistance, 3.1 years; visual symptoms, 3.9 years; dysarthria, 3.4 years; dysphagia, 4.4 years; requiring wheelchair, 8.2 years; and death, 9.7 years."
12920363,"No reports on the frequency of X-linked ichthyosis (XLI) in the Italian general population and few surveys on the frequency of XLI in large communities in the world are available.The aim of this study was the assessment of the frequency of XLI in a large representative sample of the Italian male population.This study involved young men who enlisted as conscripts in the Italian Navy from January 1998 through February 2002, examined, prior to enlistment, at the Draft Council's Medical Unit of the Italian Navy in Taranto, Italy, to evaluate their psychophysical fitness. All the patients with an ichthyosiform condition were referred to the Department of Dermatology of the Navy Hospital, underwent a thorough dermatological examination and completed a questionnaire regarding their personal and familial history. Pertinent results of the other clinical investigations were recorded and the final diagnosis was formulated on the basis of all these data.From January 1998 through February 2002, of 75,653 young men examined, 15 cases of XLI were diagnosed, with a frequency of 1:5,043 or 1.98 per 10,000 (95% confidence interval based on the Poisson distribution 1.01-2.90). Four out of 15 cases (26.6%) showed corneal opacities. No other significant associated pathological change was observed.As this study is a survey involving a large male sample, homogeneous with reference to age, race and country of origin (southern Italy), the frequency of XLI could be estimated at about 1.98 per 10,000 males. These data are roughly in agreement with estimates from other European surveys."
23419472,"To investigate X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy in an unselected population, we performed a population based, cross-sectional prevalence study, supplemented by a retrospective study of deceased subjects. Sixty-three subjects (34 males, 29 females) belonging to 22 kindreds were included. Thirty-nine subjects (13 males, 26 females) were alive, and 24 (21 males, 3 females) were deceased on the prevalence day. The point prevalence of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy in Norway on July 1, 2011, was 0.8 per 100,000 inhabitants. The incidence at birth in the period 1956-1995 was 1.6 per 100,000 inhabitants. An age-dependent penetrance was observed among males and females, with more severe phenotypes appearing with rising age. Only 5% of deceased males had not developed cerebral leukodystrophy. No female older than 50 years was neurologically intact. Sixteen mutations in the ABCD1 gene were identified. De novo mutations were found in 19% of probands. The frequency of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy was lower in Norway than reported in the literature. A more severe natural course than previously reported was observed, indicating a need for better follow-up of both male and female patients. Given the high rate of de novo mutations, identification programs such as newborn screening may be required to offer timely treatment to all patients."
8825887,"Familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP-type I) was first described in Portugal by Andrade in 1952, a time when 54 among 64 patients (belonging to 25 families) originated from Póvoa do Varzim or its surrounding districts. Since then, a total of 1,233 patients, belonging to 489 pedigrees (so far unrelated), have been diagnosed at Centro de Estudos de Paramiloidose, Porto, Portugal. Although age-of-onset showed a wide range (17 to 78 years), 87% of these 1,233 patients developed symptoms before 40 years of age (mean 33.5, SD 9.4 years). Among all patients, 432 belong to 140 families originating from the area of Póvoa do Varzim/Vila do Conde, 330 of whom lived in that area at the time of diagnosis; age-of-onset was, on average, lower than in the overall group of patients (mean 31.1, SD 6.7 years), and no patient had onset after 57 years (versus 3.3% in the global sample). As in previous studies, women were found to have a later onset (33.7) than men (29.0) years. In 1991, the crude prevalence rate was 90.3 x 10(-5) (one in every 1,108 inhabitants), and the frequency of gene carriers was estimated to be 186 x 10(-5) (one in every 538); about 48.4% of these carriers had manifested symptoms by 1991. Female patients had a significantly higher number of children (mean 3.7, SD 2.6) than male patients (mean 2.7, SD 2.1) and the length of their reproductive period (mean 8.4, SD 5.8 yr) was also greater than for men (mean 5.6, SD 4.4 yr). Altogether, the 122 patients who ever reproduced contributed 457 children to the next generation, a mean fertility of 3.7. Further studies using a control groups may answer the question of whether this is the result of a specific high fertility of these patients or just their belonging to a population in natural expansion."
23092000,"Anisakiasis, firstly described in 1960s in the Netherlands, is a fish-borne parasitic disease caused by the consumption of raw or undercooked fish or cephalopods contaminated by third stage (13) larvae of the Anisakidae family, in particular Anisakis simplex (As), A. pegreffii and Pseudoterranova decipiens. Every year, approximately 20,000 cases of anisakiasis were reported worldwide, over 90% are from Japan and most others in Spain, the Netherlands and Germany, depending on the habits of fish consuming. Live As larvae can elicit i) a parasitic infection of the digestive tract or, occasionally, other organs, causing erosive and/or haemorrhagic lesions, ascites, perforations until granulomas and masses, if larva is not removed, and ii) allergic reactions, as anaphylaxis, acute/chronic urticaria and angioedema. Like other parasite infestations, As larva induces an immune adaptive response characterised by T-lymphocyte proliferation with polyclonal and monoclonal (responsible for As allergic symptoms) IgE production, eosinophilia and mastocytosis. Several As allergens, many of which thermostable, were described In particular the major allergen Ani s 1 and Ani s 7 could characterized a past or a recent infection. There is a general agreement that an active infection is required to initiate allergic sensitivity to Anisakis. Until now, the only effective treatment for anisakiasis is the endoscopic removal of live larvae and the best protection against anisakiasis is to educate consumers about the dangers of eating raw fish and to recommend avoiding the consumption of raw or inadequately thermally treated marine fish or cephalopods."
7416755,"An investigation of a possible cluster of pemphigus cases that were diagnosed in Hartford County, Connecticut, in 1977 provided data for estimating the incidence of this disease in a defined population for the years 1972 to 1977. The average annual incidence (new cases per population per year) estimated for the overall adult population (over the age of 20 years) was 0.42 cases per 100,000 people, whereas that for Jewish adults was 3.2 cases per 100,000. Thus, the results of this report both support the hypothesis that Jewish people are at higher risk than others for the development of pemphigus and provide a basis for comparison with the results of other studies of this disease."
26320744,"Adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD) is a rare disease that is classified among the multifactorial autoinflammatory disorders. It is characterised by fever, arthritis and, a typical salmon-coloured rash, and is accompanied by fever at nights. Currently, there is limited data on the prevalence of AOSD.Patients diagnosed with AOSD at the Department of Rheumatology of Trakya University Medical Faculty, between 2003 to 2014 were reviewed retrospectively. Patients' clinical features, laboratory measurements, demographics, treatments, follow-up durations, disease courses, outcomes and complications were evaluated.Our study included 42 patients with AOSD of whom, 32 (76.2%) were females and 10 (23.8%) were males (female to male ratio: 3.2). Over the course of the study, the annual incidence of AOSD was 0.62/100,000; and the overall prevalence was 6.77/100,000. The most common findings were fever (97.6%), arthralgia (95.2%), arthritis (76.2%), rash (73.8%) and sore throat (40.5%).In our hospital-based study on AOSD which is a disease with very limited epidemiological data, the frequency of AOSD was found to be significantly higher than in other series. Female gender was more common in our series; and polycyclic pattern was more common in patients with longer follow-ups."
17420933,"Limited epidemiologic information is available on achalasia in Northern European countries and worldwide. Achalasia has never been studied in Iceland. This study aimed to evaluate the epidemiology of achalasia in Iceland and compare the findings to other studies. All patients diagnosed with achalasia in Iceland from 1952 to 2002 were identified and patients demographic and clinical history was reviewed. The incidence and prevalence of achalasia were obtained. Sixty-two achalasia patients were diagnosed during the 51-year study period, 33 males and 29 females. The mean age at diagnosis was 45.2 years (range, 13.2-85.4 years). The median duration of symptoms before diagnosis was 2.0 years. The mean prevalence was 8.7 cases/100,000 and the overall incidence was 0.55 case/100,000/year. This is the first national epidemiological study of achalasia in a genetically homogeneous population, spanning over half a century. The epidemiology of achalasia in Iceland is similar to that in most other reported studies."
17013893,"Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) are a heterogeneous group of uncommon tumors that show a broad range of differentiation that may reflect etiologic distinction. Routine tabulations of STS are not morphology-specific. Further, the lack of inclusion of sarcomas arising in all organs in most standard evaluations underestimates the true rates. We analyzed the 1978-2001 Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results program incidence rates of STS regardless of primary site, except bones and joints, using the 2002 criteria of the WHO classification. There were 26,758 cases available for analysis. Leiomyosarcomas accounted for 23.9%, malignant fibrous histiocytomas 17.1%, liposarcomas 11.5%, dermatofibrosarcomas 10.5%, rhabdomyosarcomas 4.6% and angiosarcomas 4.1%. Almost half (47.9%) of the sarcomas arose in the soft tissues, 14.0% in the skin and 7.0% in the uterus. Overall, incidence rates were highest among black women (6.26/100,000 woman-years) and the lowest among white women (4.60/100,000). Age-adjusted rates increased at 1.2% and 0.8% per year among white males and females, respectively, both trends statistically significant, while rates among blacks declined slightly. About 40% of leiomyosarcomas among women were uterine in origin, with a black/white rate ratio of 1.7. This rate ratio increased to 2.0 when we accounted for the lower prevalence of intact uteri among black compared to white women. Total STS rates rose exponentially with age. Rates for both uterine leiomyosarcoma and dermatofibrosarcoma increased rapidly during the childbearing years, peaking at about age 40 and 50, respectively. Incidence patterns of STS varied markedly by histologic type, supporting the notion that these tumors may be etiologically distinct."
19309503,"Sheldon-Hall syndrome (SHS) is a rare multiple congenital contracture syndrome characterized by contractures of the distal joints of the limbs, triangular face, downslanting palpebral fissures, small mouth, and high arched palate. Epidemiological data for the prevalence of SHS are not available, but less than 100 cases have been reported in the literature. Other common clinical features of SHS include prominent nasolabial folds, high arched palate, attached earlobes, mild cervical webbing, short stature, severe camptodactyly, ulnar deviation, and vertical talus and/or talipes equinovarus. Typically, the contractures are most severe at birth and non-progressive. SHS is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern but about half the cases are sporadic. Mutations in either MYH3, TNNI2, or TNNT3 have been found in about 50% of cases. These genes encode proteins of the contractile apparatus of fast twitch skeletal muscle fibers. The diagnosis of SHS is based on clinical criteria. Mutation analysis is useful to distinguish SHS from arthrogryposis syndromes with similar features (e.g. distal arthrogryposis 1 and Freeman-Sheldon syndrome). Prenatal diagnosis by ultrasonography is feasible at 18-24 weeks of gestation. If the family history is positive and the mutation is known in the family, prenatal molecular genetic diagnosis is possible. There is no specific therapy for SHS. However, patients benefit from early intervention with occupational and physical therapy, serial casting, and/or surgery. Life expectancy and cognitive abilities are normal."
22492317,"BACKGROUND: Observational studies showed that the profile of infective endocarditis (IE) significantly changed over the past decades. However, most studies involved referral centers. We conducted a population-based study to control for this referral bias. The objective was to update the description of characteristics of IE in France and to compare the profile of community-acquired versus healthcare-associated IE. METHODS: A prospective population-based observational study conducted in all medical facilities from 7 French regions (32% of French individuals aged ≥18 years) identified 497 adults with Duke-Li-definite IE who were first admitted to the hospital in 2008. Main measures included age-standardized and sex-standardized incidence of IE and multivariate Cox regression analysis for risk factors of in-hospital death. RESULTS: The age-standardized and sex-standardized annual incidence of IE was 33.8 (95% confidence interval [CI], 30.8-36.9) cases per million inhabitants. The incidence was highest in men aged 75-79 years. A majority of patients had no previously known heart disease. Staphylococci were the most common causal agents, accounting for 36.2% of cases (Staphylococcus aureus, 26.6%; coagulase-negative staphylococci, 9.7%). Healthcare-associated IE represented 26.7% of all cases and exhibited a clinical pattern significantly different from that of community-acquired IE. S. aureus as the causal agent of IE was the most important factor associated with in-hospital death in community-acquired IE (hazard ratio [HR], 2.82 [95% CI, 1.72-4.61]) and the single factor in healthcare-associated IE (HR, 2.54 [95% CI, 1.33-4.85]). CONCLUSIONS: S. aureus became both the leading cause and the most important prognostic factor of IE, and healthcare-associated IE appeared as a major subgroup of the disease."
18334826,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence and prevalence of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in the Republic of Uruguay. METHODS: The study was performed in Uruguay (3,241,003 inhabitants) during a 2-year period (2002-2003). To ensure complete case ascertainment, multiple sources of information were used, including all the neurologists, other medical specialties, general physicians, neurophysiology laboratories, hospital medical records and death certificates. ALS diagnosis was based on El Escorial criteria. Although all patients with motor neuron disease were enrolled in the follow-up, only probable and definite cases are included in the study. RESULTS: Between January 1st, 2002, and December 31st, 2003, 89 new patients were diagnosed with probable or definite ALS. The mean annual incidence rate was 1.37 per 100,000 persons. The incidence was higher for men (1.95) than for women (0.84) with a male to female ratio of 2:1. For both, the incidence increased throughout the years showing a peak in the 65-74 age group among men and the 55-64 age group among women. Mean age at onset of ALS disease was 58.7 years. The estimated mean annual incidence for ALS calculated by the capture recapture method was 1.42 (95% CI, 1.13-1.72). On December 31st, 2002, the crude prevalence was 1.9 per 100,000 inhabitants. CONCLUSIONS: ALS incidence is within a narrow range across countries despite the genetic, environmental and socioeconomic differences when similar prospective design, diagnosis criteria and data analyses are applied."
21546016,"BACKGROUNDS: The epidemiological studies of sarcoidosis in Spain and other countries are from more than one decade ago. OBJECTIVES: To know the current incidence in the health care area of Leon, the reasons for consultation, the thoracic radiologyl involvement, delay and diagnostic methods. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed the cases of sarcoidosis seen in our hospital between the years 2001-2008. The study is retrospective. RESULTS: 118 patients fulfilled the criteria for sarcoidosis with an incidence of 4.51/100,000 inhab./year. Of these, 53 (44.9%) were male with a mean age of 36.4 ± 12.2 and 65 (55.1%) women, with a mean age of 42.6 ± 17.2 years (P = 0.029). The most frequent presentation form was Löfgren Syndrome with 45.8%, followed by respiratory symptoms 20.3%, radiological findings 12.7%, general syndrome 10.2% and miscellaneous 11%. Thoracic radiological affectations at the time of diagnosis were: stage I: 59.3%, stage II: 19.8%, stage III: 10%, fibrosis 3.4% and stage 0: 8.5%. Transbronchial biopsy was the most frequent diagnosis. Time to diagnosis was very variable with a median of 24.5 days, when it debuted as erythema nodosum, 80 in the less frequent forms. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of sarcoidosis was superior to that previously demonstrated. It affected young adults, but with an increase in the number of cases in those over 50 years with clear female predominance. Löfgren syndrome was the most frequent presentation form, with a higher incidence in spring. Diagnostic delay varied according to the different presentation forms. Transbronchial biopsy was the main diagnostic tool."
17186100,"BACKGROUND:Microtia is a congenital defect characterized by disturbances in the size and form of the ear lobe. Anotia corresponds to the absence of the ear lobe. AIM:To study the prevalence of microtia and anotia at the Maternity of the University of Chile Clinical Hospital. MATERIAL AND METHODS:Analysis of the database of the Latin American Collaborative Study of Congenital Defects (ECLAMC). All newborns and stillborns with congenital defects are incorporated to this database. RESULTS:The prevalence of microtia-anotia in the period 1982-2001 was 8.7 per 10,000 born alive. Chilean hospitals have an uniform prevalence of 5.2 per 10,000 born alive. Thirty seven percent presented as isolated malformations and the rest were associated to other defects. Eighty six percent of non isolated cases were part of a syndrome. Sixty eight percent were mild or moderate forms and the rest, severe forms. Two cases were stillborns and two newborns died before hospital discharge. CONCLUSIONS:The prevalence of microtia in this hospital and in the rest of Chilean hospitals is significantly higher than in the rest of non Chilean hospitals participating in the ECLAMC, that is 4.1 per 10,000 born alive."
24962008,"BACKGROUND: There are no reliable epidemiological data on sarcoidosis in the French West Indies, although this disease is known to be more frequent and more severe in Black African-Americans and West Indians. OBJECTIVES: This retrospective study aimed to assess the incidence and prevalence of sarcoidosis in Guadeloupe over a 7-year period and to determine its epidemiological, clinical, and evolutionary characteristics. METHODS: Patients were identified through the computerized databases of the three pathology laboratories and two hospitals on the islands of Guadeloupe. Histologically proven cases of sarcoidosis were selected. All patients were recalled at a single study time-point. RESULTS: A total of 75 patients were identified. These included 44 women and 31 men (sex ratio: 1.4), with a mean ± standard deviation (SD) age of 47 ± 14 years and Fitzpatrick skin types IV-VI. The average incidence was 2.28 per 100,000 inhabitants per year (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.69-3.02). The prevalence of sarcoidosis in 2009 was 21.09 per 100,000 inhabitants (95% CI 16.00-26.18). Most patients (61/71, 85.9%) exhibited multiple organ involvement; the mean ± SD number of organs involved was 2.6 ± 1.1. The initiation of systemic therapy was required in 75.7% of cases. Several lines of treatment were necessary in 41.5% of affected patients. At the study time-point, seven patients were found to have died. Four of these deaths were directly attributable to sarcoidosis (mortality rate: 5.3%). CONCLUSIONS: This epidemiological study on sarcoidosis in Guadeloupe reveals a low incidence of the disease and a high degree of severity as evidenced by the average number of affected organs, the high frequency of extrathoracic organ involvement, the frequent use of corticosteroids, and a mortality rate of 5.3%."
7488368,"OBJECTIVE:To obtain pilot data about the incidence, need for surgical intervention, and demographics of recurrent respiratory papillomas in the United States. DESIGN:Otolaryngologists were surveyed using a questionnaire with structured and open-ended questions. PARTICIPANTS:One thousand board-certified otolaryngologists practicing in the United States as of January 1, 1993, through a random mailing list provided by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery and all active US members of the American Society of Pediatric Otolaryngology and the American Bronchoesophagological Association. A total of 1346 questionnaires were distributed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:Physician's responses to questions about their current patient load of children and adults with recurrent respiratory papillomas, their surgical and anesthetic management of the disease, and their clinical experiences with risk factors for developing recurrent respiratory papillomas. RESULTS:Projected totals for recurrent respiratory papillomas among children were 2354 new cases (95% confidence interval [CI], 1448 to 3260) and 5970 active cases (95% CI, 3465 to 8474), requiring 16,597 surgical procedures (95% CI, 6938 to 26,255) at a cost of $109 million (95% CI, $45 to 172 million) for March 1, 1993 to March 31, 1994. Projected totals for adult recurrent respiratory papillomas were 3623 new cases (95% CI, 2359 to 4887) and 9015 active cases (95% CI, 6435 to 11,591) requiring 9284 surgical procedures (95% CI, 6003 to 12,565) at a cost of $42 million (95% CI, $27 to $59 million) for March 1, 1993 to March 31, 1994. The incidence of recurrent respiratory papillomas among children is estimated at 4.3 per 100,000; among adults, 1.8 per 100,000. The carbon dioxide laser was favored by 92% of respondents. No consensus was reached on the role for cesarean section. Forty-six percent of respondents favored the use of a laser-safe endotracheal tube for anesthetic management. CONCLUSION:A registry of patients with recurrent respiratory papillomas would benefit future research protocols and provide long-term follow-up of patients."
22000754,"Newborn screening (NBS) by tandem mass spectrometry started in Galicia (Spain) in 2000. We analyse the results of screening and clinical follow-up of inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) detected during 10 years. Our programme basically includes the disorders recommended by the American College of Medical Genetics. Since 2002, blood and urine samples have been collected from every newborn on the 3rd day of life; before then, samples were collected between the 5th and 8th days. Newborns who show abnormal results are referred to the clinical unit for diagnosis and treatment. In these 10 years, NBS has led directly to the identification of 137 IEM cases (one per 2060 newborns, if 35 cases of benign hyperphenylalaninemia are excluded). In addition, 33 false positive results and 10 cases of transitory elevation of biomarkers were identified (making the positive predictive rate 76.11%), and 4 false negative results. The use of urine samples contributed significantly to IEM detection in 44% of cases. Clinical symptoms appeared before positive screening results in nine patients (6.6%), four of them screened between days 5 and 8. The death rate was 2.92%; of the survivors, 95.5% were asymptomatic after a mean observation period of 54 months, and only two had an intellectual/psychomotor development score less than 85. Compared to other studies, a high incidence of type I glutaric aciduria was detected, one in 35,027 newborns. This report highlights the benefits of urine sample collection during screening, and it is the first study on expanded newborn screening results in Spain."
17964524,"PURPOSE: To critically evaluate our experience in molecular testing of Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) and to use this information to devise a general approach to heterogeneous recessive disorders. Careful clinical and molecular characterization of large cohorts of patients affected with inherited eye diseases will be an essential step in the development of effective therapy for these diseases, especially when the therapy involves gene replacement. DESIGN: A molecular genetic case-control study. METHODS: Six hundred forty-two unrelated individuals with the clinical diagnosis of LCA and 200 unrelated control individuals were screened for disease-causing sequence variations in eight genes using various combinations of single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis (SSCP), automated DNA sequencing, multiplex allele-specific ligation analysis (SNPlex), and high-density solid-phase single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping. RESULTS: Four hundred forty instances of 189 different disease-causing sequence variations were observed in this study, 98 of which have not been previously reported. One hundred forty-six of the 189 variations (77%) were observed in only a single individual. The observed variations were not evenly distributed among the LCA patients or among the eight genes. Empirical analysis of this uneven distribution was used to devise a multi-platform mutation detection strategy that is four times more efficient than a more conventional strategy of completely sequencing all of the coding regions of all LCA genes in all subjects. Hardy-Weinberg analysis of the observed mutations suggests that these eight genes are collectively responsible for about 70% of the cases of LCA in North America. The carrier frequency of the most common LCA allele (an intron 26 variation in CEP290) was found to be 2/3,248, which suggests that the overall prevalence of LCA in this population is about 1/81,000. An allele-specific ligation assay (SNPlex) was designed to detect 68 of the most common LCA-causing alleles, and semi-quantitative analysis of the data from this assay also revealed examples of gene deletion and isodisomy in the cohort. CONCLUSIONS: The data demonstrates that a tiered screening strategy combining allele-specific detection with automated DNA sequencing can increase the efficiency of autosomal recessive mutation detection four-fold when compared with DNA sequencing alone. However, the very high rate of unique mutations observed in this study (77%) suggests that DNA sequencing will remain an important part of the overall strategy if high sensitivity is to be achieved."
21763944,"In a population-based retrospective cohort of 5,353,022 California births from 1991 to 2000, 3,152 newborns were diagnosed with congenital hydrocephalus during the birth hospitalization. We compared demographic and clinical characteristics of infants with and without congenital hydrocephalus, and examined in-hospital fatality rates. The prevalence of congenital hydrocephalus was 5.9 per 10,000. During the study period, there was a decline in congenital hydrocephalus due to spina bifida (1.4 to 0.9 per 10,000), and an increase in congenital hydrocephalus due to obstructive hydrocephalus (0.5 to 1.0 per 10,000). Independent risk factors for congenital hydrocephalus were birth weight <1,500 g (odds ratio [OR] 51.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] 47.7-55.8) and birth weight 1,500-2,000 g (OR 14.1, 95% CI 12.4-16) compared to birth weight greater than 2,000 g, low socioeconomic status (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.4-1.6), and male sex (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.1-1.3). Asians had a decreased risk for congenital hydrocephalus (OR 0.7, 95% CI 0.6-0.8) when compared to whites. Thirteen percent of affected neonates died before hospital discharge."
25559212,"OBJECTIVE: Kleine-Levin syndrome is a rare disease characterized by recurrent episodes of hypersomnia with behavioral and cognitive disturbances. We aimed at describing the diagnosis procedure, risk factors, and severe forms. METHODS: In consecutive patients referred for suspected Kleine-Levin syndrome, we detailed differential diagnoses, and atypical and secondary cases, compared typical patients with healthy subjects, and examined the characteristics of patients with prolonged (>30 days) episodes. RESULTS: Among 166 referred patients, 120 had typical primary Kleine-Levin syndrome (syndrome secondary to brain diseases; n = 4, atypical syndrome, n = 7; differential diagnoses that were mostly psychiatric, n = 29; incomplete information, n = 6). The prevalence in France was 1.8 per million. The patients were often male (64%) and had more frequent birth and developmental abnormalities (45%) than controls (despite normal karyotypes), and most (80%) had teenage onset, with no difference between patients with prolonged (n = 34) and short (n = 85) episodes. In patients with prolonged episodes, the durations of the first episode (32 ± 33 vs 11 ± 6 days) and subsequent episodes were longer (mean episode duration = 23 ± 19 vs 10 ± 3 days) and the disease course tended to be longer (9 ± 6 vs 6 ± 4 years). During episodes, patients with prolonged episodes had shorter sleep time, higher levels of anxiety, increased agitation, and more feelings of disembodiment and amnesia. Between episodes, they were more tired, needed more naps, fell asleep more rapidly, and had higher anxiety/depression scores. INTERPRETATION: Mental disorders are frequent differential diagnoses of Kleine-Levin syndrome. One-third of patients have prolonged (>1 month) episodes with more frequent immediate and long-term consequences of the disease, prompting therapeutic trials."
19784524,"BACKGROUND: Hereditary palmoplantar keratodermas (HPPK) are relatively frequent in Slovenia; however, the papulosa type of HPPK is rare. Epidemiological data are scarce; a population study in Croatia revealed a prevalence of 1.17/100,000 inhabitants. According to the preliminary data, it seems that HPPK papulosa is more common in Slovenia than in other countries. Efforts were made to identify all patients with HPPK papulosa in Slovenia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Existing hospital and outpatient records served as a starting point. Patients and their relatives were invited for examination. When necessary for preparing pedigrees, we visited patients. RESULTS: Altogether 66 patients were observed, giving a prevalence of 3.3/100,000 inhabitants. 62 patients belonged to 11 unrelated families with two or more affected members and there were also four isolated cases. Our investigation points to an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. All of the routine biochemical and hematologic tests were within normal limits. No malignancies were observed, nor were such data revealed in patients' histories. Thickened nail-plates were observed in three patients. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of HPPK papulosa in Slovenia is higher than in other countries studied. Further loci mentioned in literature suggest a genetic heterogeneity in this condition."
19542212,"Takayasu arteritis (TAK) is a large-vessel vasculitis of unknown aetiology. The annual incidence in hospital-based studies is 1-2/million. The UK General Practice Research Database (UKGPRD) contains complete primary care records on 3.6 million people. There are no data on the incidence of TAK in the UK or from primary care anywhere in the world. The aim of this study was to determine the annual incidence of TAK in the UK using the UKGPRD and in a well-defined hospital population [Norfolk Vasculitis Register (NORVASC)].We identified all patients in the UKGPRD with a first diagnosis of TAK during 2000-05, using the Read code (G757); and in the NORVASC population. The annual incidence was calculated as the number of incident cases divided by total person-years.A total of 14 (13 females) subjects were identified with a first diagnosis of TAK during 2000-05 in the UKGPRD. The median age was 51.0 years (interquartile range 28-66). The overall annual incidence of TAK was 0.8/million (95% CI 0.4, 1.3). The incidence was stable throughout the study period. The mean prevalence of TAK was 4.7/million. There were six patients (five females) aged <40 years presenting in 2000-05 with TAK. The annual incidence in those aged <40 years was 0.3/million. In the NORVASC population, one case was identified (0.4/million/year) with three prevalent cases (7.1/million).This is the first population-based study of the epidemiology of TAK. The annual incidence and prevalence are consistent with previous studies."
6967865,"The incidence of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) in Switzerland was calucated for patients born in 1960 to 1974. Information was obtained by means of questionnaires sent to all Pediatric Hospitals and Institutes of Pathology in Switzerland. The number of patients and the incidences of the different enzyme defects were: all cases 110 (1:13785 livebirths), 21-hydroxylase 98 (1:15472), 11 beta-hydroxylase 5 (1:303260), 3 beta-dehydrogenase 3 (1:505433). The incidence of females--which is 1:12098 for all cases and 1:13924 for 21-hydroxylase deficiency--presumably appropximates more exactly the real incidence, because of incomplete diagnosis in the male. Salt loss was observed in two thirds of patients with 21-hydroxylase deficiency. A more reliable estimate of the incidence of CAH could be obtained by neonatal screening programs with measurement of serum-17-hydroxyprogesterone."
22966025,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Despite the implementation of screening guidelines to identify infants at risk for hyperbilirubinemia, chronic bilirubin encephalopathy (CBE) continues to be reported worldwide in otherwise healthy infants. The incidence of CBE in Canada is unknown. The objectives of this study were to establish the incidence of CBE in Canada and identify epidemiological and medical risk factors associated with its occurrence. METHODS: Data on infants were collected prospectively through the Canadian Pediatric Surveillance Program. Infants born between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2008 were included if they either had symptoms of CBE and a history of hyperbilirubinemia, or if they presented in the newborn period with severe hyperbilirubinemia and an abnormal MRI finding as per the reporting physician. RESULTS: During the study period, 20 cases were identified; follow-up data were available for 14 of these. The causes for the hyperbilirubinemia included glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (n = 5), sepsis (n = 2), ABO incompatibility and other red blood cell antibodies (n = 7). Fifteen infants had abnormal brain MRI findings during the neonatal period. At follow-up, 5 infants developed classic choreoathetoid cerebral palsy, 6 had spectrum of neurologic dysfunction and developmental delay (as described by the reporting physician), and 3 were healthy. CONCLUSIONS: CBE continues to occur in Canada at an incidence that appears to be higher than previously reported."
11127535,"There have been few epidemiological studies of dystonia. Most previous studies have provided estimates based on few cases. A European prevalence study was undertaken to provide more precise rates of dystonia by pooling data from eight European countries. Diagnosed cases were ascertained by adult neurologists with specialist movement disorder (and botulinum toxin) clinics. The crude annual period prevalence rate (1996-1997) for primary dystonia was 152 per million (95% confidence interval 142-162), with focal dystonia having the highest rate of 117 per million (108-126). Prevalence rates for cervical dystonia, blepharospasm and writer's cramp were as follows: 57 (95% confidence interval 51-63), 36 (31-41), and 14 (11-17). The age-adjusted relative rates were significantly higher in women than in men for segmental and focal dystonias with the exception of writer's cramp. Comparing rates between centres demonstrated significant variations for cervical dystonia, blepharospasm and writer's cramp, probably due to methodological differences. Our results provide the first data on the prevalence of primary dystonia and its subtypes across several European countries. Due to under-ascertainment of cases, our rates should be seen as conservative and an under-estimate of the true prevalence of dystonia."
10972657,"Incidence and prevalence, the measures of ""frequency, "" are often confused. While in a nonhereditary situation, the useful parameter is the incidence rate, evaluating the impact of an etiologic factor, it is prevalence that is considered useful in a hereditary disease. Prevalence may concern either the whole population or a fraction of this population, that is, males or females or individuals at a given age, for example, at birth. Pathologic phenotype and morbid genotype prevalences have to be clearly differentiated. In this article, we review the epidemiologic surveys allowing an estimation of the distribution of major single-gene kidney diseases progressing to renal failure in different populations. In order to compare their results, the geographic/ethnic composition of the population, the determination of its size, the choice and mode of calculation of the epidemiologic measure, the definition of the disease and modes of diagnosis, the inclusion of cases, the sources of ascertainment and the possible causes of underascertainment, and the period of time during which events were counted should be analyzed accurately. Although their impact in terms of morbidity, hospitalizations, mortality, and cost to society is high, this review shows that information on the prevalence of single-gene kidney diseases is far from complete. To date, the data essentially apply to large populations of European origin. A part of the variation among prevalence data may be due to methodological differences. Not representative are the small populations in which some rare diseases, especially recessive, are found with a high prevalence."
20224900,"Biotinidase deficiency is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder included in many newborn screening programmes. Prior to the introduction of screening for biotinidase deficiency in Sweden in 2002, the disorder was almost unknown, with only one case diagnosed clinically. Biotinidase activity was measured in dried blood spots with a semiquantitative method using biotin-6-amidoquinoline as substrate. The cutoff value was set at 25% (later lowered to 20%) of the mean activity of all samples measured on that day. The disorder was confirmed by quantitative determination of biotinidase activity in plasma and DNA analyses. Over a period of 6 years, 13 patients were identified among 637,452 screened newborns and 5,068 adoptive/immigrant children. None of the patients had clinical symptoms at the time of diagnosis. Six patients had profound biotinidase deficiency, with an activity of 0-5% of normal in plasma. Four of these patients were born to parents who were first cousins of Middle Eastern or African origin. Eighteen gene alterations were identified, nine of which have not previously been described: seven mutations p.L83S (c.248T > C), p.R148H (c.443G > A), p.N202I (c.605A > T), p.I255T (c.764T > C), p.N402S (c.1205A > G), p.L405P (c.1214T > C), p.G445R (c.1333G > A) and two silent mutations p.L71L (c.211C > T) and p.L215L (c.645C > T). The predicted severity of the novel mutations was analyzed by sorting intolerant from tolerant (SIFT) and polymorphism phenotyping (PolyPhen), predicting p.L83S, p.L405P and p.G445R as severe mutations. Due to the high rate of immigrants since 1990 from non-Nordic countries, the incidence of biotinidase deficiency is similar to that found in many other Western countries."
22911283,"OBJECTIVE:The objective of this study was to determine the incidence and etiology of congenital hypothyroidism (CH) in Uberaba, MG. SUBJECTS AND METHODS:From 2001 to 2010, by reviewing patient files from a public reference outpatient unit. The screening program covered 88% of live-born children. RESULTS:CH was diagnosed in 16 children, representing an incidence of 1:2,017 live-born children screened. The etiological evaluation was done in 15 children and revealed seven cases of thyroid dysgenesis, seven of dyshormonogenesis, and one case of transient hypothyroidism. One child moved away from the state before etiological investigation was carried out. CONCLUSION:We concluded that both the incidence of CH and of dyshormonogenesis as the main causes of CH were increased in the investigated region, but molecular studies are necessary for a better definition of etiology."
20507242,"As part of a collaborative project on the epidemiology of craniofacial anomalies, funded by the National Institutes for Dental and Craniofacial Research and channeled through the Human Genetics Programme of the World Health Organization, the International Perinatal Database of Typical Orofacial Clefts (IPDTOC) was established in 2003. IPDTOC is collecting case-by-case information on cleft lip with or without cleft palate and on cleft palate alone from birth defects registries contributing to at least one of three collaborative organizations: European Surveillance Systems of Congenital Anomalies (EUROCAT) in Europe, National Birth Defects Prevention Network (NBDPN) in the United States, and International Clearinghouse for Birth Defects Surveillance and Research (ICBDSR) worldwide. Analysis of the collected information is performed centrally at the ICBDSR Centre in Rome, Italy, to maximize the comparability of results. The present paper, the first of a series, reports data on the prevalence of cleft lip with or without cleft palate from 54 registries in 30 countries over at least 1 complete year during the period 2000 to 2005. Thus, the denominator comprises more than 7.5 million births. A total of 7704 cases of cleft lip with or without cleft palate (7141 livebirths, 237 stillbirths, 301 terminations of pregnancy, and 25 with pregnancy outcome unknown) were available. The overall prevalence of cleft lip with or without cleft palate was 9.92 per 10,000. The prevalence of cleft lip was 3.28 per 10,000, and that of cleft lip and palate was 6.64 per 10,000. There were 5918 cases (76.8%) that were isolated, 1224 (15.9%) had malformations in other systems, and 562 (7.3%) occurred as part of recognized syndromes. Cases with greater dysmorphological severity of cleft lip with or without cleft palate were more likely to include malformations of other systems."
17290457,"The c.907delGAG mutation in the TOR1A gene (also named DYT1) is the most common cause of early-onset primary dystonia. The mutation frequency and prevalence have so far been only estimated from rare clinical epidemiological reports in some populations. The purpose of this study was to investigate the incidence at birth of the c.907delGAG mutation in a French-representative mixed population of newborn from South-Eastern France. We applied an automated high-throughput genotyping method to dried blood spot samples from 12,000 newborns registered in Hérault between 2004 and 2005. Only one allele was found to carry the mutation, which allows to determine its incidence at birth as 1/12,000 per year in this area."
19650784,"BACKGROUND: Pituitary adenomas (PAs) are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The optimal delivery of services and the provision of care for patients with PAs require distribution of the resources proportionate to the impact of these conditions on the community. Currently, the resource allocation for PAs in the health care system is lacking a reliable and an up-to-date epidemiological background that would reflect the recent advances in the diagnostic technologies, leading to the earlier recognition of these tumours. OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence, the diagnostic delay and the characteristics of patients with PA in a well-defined geographical area of the UK (Banbury, Oxfordshire). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixteen general practitioner (GP) surgeries covering the area of Banbury and a total population of 89 334 inhabitants were asked to participate in the study (data confirmed on 31 July 2006). Fourteen surgeries with a total of 81,449 inhabitants (91% of the study population) agreed to take part. All cases of PAs were found following an exhaustive computer database search of agreed terms by the staff of each Practice and data on age, gender, presenting manifestations and their duration, imaging features at diagnosis, history of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 and family history of PA were collected. RESULTS: A total of 63 patients with PA were identified amongst the study population of 81,149, with a prevalence of 77.6 PA cases/100,000 inhabitants (prolactinomas; PRLoma: 44.4, nonfunctioning PAs: 22.2, acromegaly; ACRO: 8.6, corticotroph adenoma: 1.2 and unknown functional status; UFS: 1.2/100,000 inhabitants). The distribution of each PA subtype was for PRLoma 57%, nonfunctioning PAs 28%, ACRO 11%, corticotroph adenoma 2% and UFS 2%. The median age at diagnosis and the duration of symptoms until diagnosis (in years) were for PRLoma 32.0 and 1.5, nonfunctioning PAs 51.5 and 0.8, ACRO 47 and 4.5 and corticotroph adenoma 57 and 7, respectively. PRLoma was the most frequent PA diagnosed up to the age of 60 years (0-20 years: 75% and 20-60 years: 61% of PAs) and nonfunctioning PA after the age of 60 years (60% of PAs). Nonfunctioning PAs dominated in men (57% of all men with PA) and PRLoma in women (76% of all women with PA). Five patients (7.9%) presented with classical pituitary apoplexy, with a prevalence of 6.2 cases/100,000 inhabitants. CONCLUSIONS: Based on a well-defined population in Banbury (Oxfordshire, UK), we have shown that PAs have a fourfold increased prevalence than previously thought; our data confirm that PAs have a higher burden on the Health Care System and optimal resource distribution for both clinical care and research activities aiming to improve the outcome of these patients are needed."
11359466,"Before the discovery of the myotonic dystrophy (DM) gene, the DM epidemiological rates could not be accurately estimated. The aim of this study was to calculate the DM prevalence rates in Padova (North-East Italy) and in four provinces of North-West Tuscany (Central Italy) and, as of 30 June 1999, to do so using molecular genetic testing. A minimum prevalence rate of 9.31x10(-5) inhabitants was found, consistent with epidemiological rates worldwide, and more than two times as high as those of two previous studies conducted in the same areas during the era prior to molecular genetic testing. This study, the first in Italy since the discovery of the DM gene, underlines the importance of direct genetic diagnosis of DM, especially in detecting mildly affected patients, a fundamental step in correctly estimating the risk of disease transmission in affected families."
6626822,"Reliable estimates of the incidence of the Robin Anomalad (Pierre Robin Syndrome) are not readily available in standard texts. An analysis of admissions to the Mersey Regional Cleft Palate Unit (Alder Hey Children's Hospital, Liverpool and the Royal Liverpool Children's Hospital, Heswall) over a 23-year period suggests an incidence of 1:8500 live births."
14664466,"We describe eight patients with associated multiple sclerosis (MS) and myasthenia gravis (MG). Patients were less than 50 years old at the time of onset, and seven were female. The clinical course of both MS and MG was mild in most patients. To our knowledge, this represents the largest reported series. We provide further evidence for a nonrandom association of these two diseases and discuss common mechanisms of pathogenesis."
24101363,"Few population-based studies exist of long-term trends in penile cancer. We report incidence and mortality trends in England over the 31 years 1979-2009 and survival trends over the 40 years 1971-2010.We calculated annual incidence and mortality rates per 100,000 by age and calendar period. We estimated incidence and mortality rate ratios for cohorts born since 1890, and one- and five-year relative survival (%) by age and deprivation category.A total of 9,690 men were diagnosed with penile cancer during 1979-2009. Age-standardized incidence rates increased by 21 %, from 1.10 to 1.33 per 100,000. Mortality rates fell by 20 % after 1994, from 0.39 to 0.31 per 100,000. Survival analyses included 11,478 men diagnosed during 1971-2010. Five-year relative survival increased from 61.4 to 70.2 %. Five-year survival for men diagnosed 2006-2010 was 77 % for men aged under 60 years and 53 % for men aged 80-99 years. The 8 % difference in five-year survival (66-74 %) between men in the most affluent and most deprived groups was not statistically significant.The 21 % increase in penile cancer incidence in England since the 1970s may be explained by changes in sexual practice, greater exposure to sexually transmitted oncogenic human papilloma viruses, and decreasing rates of childhood circumcision. Improvement in survival is likely due to advances in diagnostic, staging and surgical techniques. There is a need for public health education and potential preventative strategies to address the increasing incidence."
10684834,"AIMS:To establish current epidemiological data, risks, and interventional outcomes of newly diagnosed sympathetic ophthalmia (SO). METHODS:Prospective surveillance took place of all permanently employed ophthalmologists in the UK and Republic of Ireland by a monthly reporting card through the British Ophthalmological Surveillance Unit. Case ascertainment was made of newly diagnosed SO from July 1997 and questionnaire data were returned at baseline, 6 months, and 1 year after diagnosis. RESULTS:23 patients with newly diagnosed SO were recruited over 15 months, corresponding to a minimum estimated incidence of 0.03/100 000. Baseline data were available on 18 patients, in whom SO occurred after surgery in 11 patients, after retinal surgery alone in six patients, and after accidental trauma in seven patients. 12 of the 16 patients with 1 year follow up had a visual acuity of 6/12 or better. Good visual outcome was related to prompt and adequate systemic immunosuppressive therapy. CONCLUSIONS:The incidence of sympathetic ophthalmia is very low. The main current risk is surgery, particularly retinal surgery, but visual prognosis is good if early diagnosis is made and rapid, adequate immunotherapy is commenced."
19096983,"OBJECTIVE: Cystinuria is an inherited transport disorder due to defects in intestinal and renal transport of cystine and dibasic amino acids. Early diagnosis is required for some general and specific treatments because cystinuric patients have an increased risk of recurrent urinary stone formation. The prevalence of cystinuria varies widely in different countries. The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of cystinuria among schoolchildren in Eskisehir, a central Anatolian city in Turkey. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The sodium cyanide-nitroprusside spot test was applied to the first morning urine samples from 8260 schoolchildren (4087 female, 4173 male, aged between 6 and 12 years). Urine and blood amino acids were determined with paper chromatography and special cystine-homocystine chromatography were performed if a child had a positive spot-test result. Urinary cystine levels of two children were measured quantitatively. RESULTS: Spot-test results were positive in four students. Increased levels of cystine and dibasic amino acids in the urine were determined with paper chromatography and cystine spots were also detected with special cystine-homocystine chromatography for these four students. Urinary cystine levels were elevated in two children whose urine could be studied. The prevalence of cystinuria in this study was 1:2065. There was no history or symptoms related to urolithiasis in these students. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of cystinuria in this study is higher than many other countries. Patients in Turkey with urinary stones or with symptoms related to urolithiasis must also be investigated for cystinuria."
23254495,"AIM: To establish Acute Rheumatic Fever (ARF) rates within the Tairawhiti District Health Board (1997-2009) to identify communities for primary prevention programmes. METHOD: ARF cases (1997-2009) sought by audit of Gisborne Hospital admissions, penicillin prophylaxis lists and the EpiSurv notifiable disease database. RESULTS: ARF rates (n=44 cases) during 1997 to 2009 (7.6/100,000) with a continuing significant disparity between Maori (n=40, 15.2/100,000) and non-Maori, (n=3, 1.1/100,000). One case was Pacific. This disparity was marked in school-aged children (5-14 years: Maori 59/100,000 vs non-Maori 8/100,000). Over 80% of ARF cases demonstrated heart damage (18% moderate, 20% severe and 8% requiring heart surgery). ARF cases were strongly associated with living and schooling within high deprivation areas  Forty ARF cases were enrolled in 13/21 Gisborne schools, 4/18 East Coast schools and 2/17 western rural schools. (No school for 8 cases). When assessed as a percentage of school rolls there were no discernable differences between primary, intermediate and secondary schools. Of the 44 cases, 35 (80%) resided in areas of NZDep06 score 8-10 (most deprived). CONCLUSION: Very high ARF rates were recorded in the 1960's; the continuing burden of ARF in Maori children indicate a strong requirement for primary prevention strategies. Progress has plateaued in the last 20 years."
23194659,"To characterize Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) in western Sweden, focusing on genotype, clinical picture, prevalence and age of onset as well as time to diagnosis.Patients with autoinflammatory diseases are continuously registered at the five main hospitals in Western Sweden. Case records of patients with FMF were analysed retrospectively. Population data on immigration was retrieved from Statistics Sweden.Until 2008, 37 patients with FMF were identified. The prevalence among inhabitants of Turkish, Lebanese, Syrian and Iranian origin was 173, 124, 86 and 17/100 000, respectively. Median age at first symptoms was 4 years (range 3 month-37 years) and at diagnosis 10 years (range 2-44 years). Median time from first symptoms to diagnosis was 4 years (range <1 year-34 years). Among 32 patients screened for twelve common mutations, 75% were homozygotes or compound heterozygotes, 16% were heterozygotes and in 9% no mutation was found. In our cohort the frequencies of symptoms were fever 100%, peritonitis 92%, pleuritis 22% and arthritis 11%.The majority of patients with FMF present during childhood. The prevalence among immigrants in western Sweden is in the same range as in their country of origin. Time to diagnosis needs to be shortened by means of increased awareness of the disease."
15000674,"Individuals with fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) premutation (55 to 200 CGG repeats) are typically unaffected by fragile X syndrome. However, a subgroup of older males with the premutation have developed a neurological syndrome, which usually begins between 50 and 70 years and is associated with a progressive intention tremor and/or ataxia manifested by balance problems, frequent falling, and Parkinsonian symptoms, such as masked facies, intermittent resting tremor, and mild rigidity. This finding has been termed the fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) and has brought focus to the aging process in individuals with the FMR1 mutation. The premutation is associated with elevated messenger RNA levels leading to the formation of intranuclear inclusions in neurons and astrocytes associated with FXTAS. This review is a summary of our experience with FXTAS in male carriers of the premutation."
24690439,"BACKGROUND: Several new targeted genes and clinical subtypes have been identified since publication in 2008 of the report of the last international consensus meeting on diagnosis and classification of epidermolysis bullosa (EB). As a correlate, new clinical manifestations have been seen in several subtypes previously described. OBJECTIVE: We sought to arrive at an updated consensus on the classification of EB subtypes, based on newer data, both clinical and molecular. RESULTS: In this latest consensus report, we introduce a new approach to classification (""onion skinning"") that takes into account sequentially the major EB type present (based on identification of the level of skin cleavage), phenotypic characteristics (distribution and severity of disease activity; specific extracutaneous features; other), mode of inheritance, targeted protein and its relative expression in skin, gene involved and type(s) of mutation present, and--when possible--specific mutation(s) and their location(s). LIMITATIONS: This classification scheme critically takes into account all published data through June 2013. Further modifications are likely in the future, as more is learned about this group of diseases. CONCLUSION: The proposed classification scheme should be of value both to clinicians and researchers, emphasizing both clinical and molecular features of each EB subtype, and has sufficient flexibility incorporated in its structure to permit further modifications in the future."
7586664,"In a territory-wide survey of Huntington's disease (HD) in the Chinese population of Hong Kong, 20 patients from 11 families were identified from 1984 to 1991, giving a low period prevalence of 3.7 per 10(6) population. Six patients had died by 1991, hence the point prevalence was even lower, being 2.5 per 10(6) population. The male to female ratio was 3:1. No paternal transmission effect on the age of onset was observed. Apart from these differences, the clinical and pathological features were similar to those seen in the West."
23371924,"BACKGROUND: The reported birth prevalence of orofacial clefts (OFCs) varies considerably. This study describes the epidemiology of OFCs in an Australian population. METHODS: We studied infants diagnosed with cleft lip, with or without cleft palate (CL±P), and cleft palate only (CPO) since 1980 and reported to the population based Western Australian Register of Developmental Anomalies. We calculated prevalence rates by sex, Aboriginal status, geographic location, and socio-economic status. Associations between clefts and folate availability, pregnancy characteristics, pregnancy outcomes, other congenital anomalies, and age at diagnosis were also investigated. RESULTS: From 1980 to 2009, 917 infants with CL±P (12.05 per 10,000) and from 1980 to 2004, 621 infants with CPO (10.12 per 10,000) were registered. Prevalence rates for CL±P and CPO were 1.9 and 1.3 times higher, respectively, for Aboriginal Australians. Additional anomalies were reported for 31% of infants with CL±P and for 61% with CPO; chromosomal anomalies and other specific diagnoses accounted for 46% and 66%, respectively, of those with CL±P and CPO with additional anomalies. Almost all (99.7%) children with CL±P were diagnosed before 1 year of age, but 12% of CPO diagnoses were made after 1 year of age; 94% of these diagnoses were of submucous clefts and bifid uvula. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide a picture of the prevalence of OFCs in WA since 1980, and provide a useful reference for OFC data in Australia and internationally. The quality and completeness of the WARDA data are high, reflected in high prevalence rates, and proportions of clefts occurring with other anomalies."
21801158,"BACKGROUND: Junctional epidermolysis bullosa, type Herlitz (JEB-H) is a lethal, autosomal recessive blistering disease caused by null mutations in the genes coding for the lamina lucida/densa adhesion protein laminin-332 (LAMB3, LAMA3 and LAMC2). OBJECTIVES: To present the diagnostic features and molecular analyses of all 22 patients with JEB-H in the Dutch Epidermolysis Bullosa Registry between 1988 and 2011, and to calculate the disease incidence and carrier frequency in the Netherlands. METHODS: All patients were analysed with immunofluorescence antigen mapping (IF), electron microscopy (EM) and molecular analysis. RESULTS: The mean lifespan of our patients with JEB-H was 5·8 months (range 0·5-32·6). IF showed absent (91%) or strongly reduced (9%) staining for laminin-332 with monoclonal antibody GB3. In EM the hemidesmosomes and sub-basal dense plates were hypoplastic or absent. We identified mutations in all 22 patients: in 19 we found LAMB3 mutations, in two LAMA3 mutations, and in one LAMC2 mutations. We found three novel splice site mutations in LAMB3: (i) c.29-2A>G resulting in an out-of-frame skip of exon 3 and a premature termination codon (PTC); (ii) c.1289-2_1296del10 leading to an out-of-frame skip of exon 12 and a PTC; and (iii) c.3228+1G>T leading to an exon 21 skip. CONCLUSIONS: All diagnostic tools should be evaluated to clarify the diagnosis of JEB-H. We have identified 11 different mutations in 22 patients with JEB-H, three of them novel. In the Netherlands the incidence rate of JEB-H is 4·0 per one million live births. The carrier frequency of a JEB-H mutation in the Dutch population is 1 in 249."
19459517,"OBJECTIVE: To identify the incidence and determine causes and pregnancy outcomes of hydrops fetalis at Srinagarind Hospital. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective descriptive study. SETTING: Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Faculty of Medicine, Srinagarind Hospital, Khon Kaen University. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A retrospective medical record review of all pregnant women and newborns who were diagnosed with hydrops fetalis at all gestational ages and delivered at Srinagarind Hospital between 1996 and 2005. RESULTS: During the period of study, the incidence of hydrops fetalis was 1.80 per 1,000 total births (82 cases of 45,499 total births). Thirty-nine cases (47.56%) were idiopathic, 30 cases (36.58%) were Hb Bart's hydrops fetalis, and three (3.66%) cases were caused by congenital infection. The others 10 cases (12.19%) were achondrogenesis, Turner syndrome, twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome, severe anemia with unknown primary cause, cystic hygroma, multiple congenital anomalies, and Rh isoimmunization. The mortality rate of hydrops fetalis in the present series was 98.78%. One case, caused by Rh isoimmunization, survived. Maternal complications were 30 cases (36.59%) consisting of preeclampsia, preterm labor, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, placenta previa, and postpartum hemorrhage. CONCLUSION: The incidence of hydrops fetalis was 1.80 per 1,000 total births. The common known cause was Hb Bart's hydrops fetalis. The mortality rate of hydrops fetalis in the present study was very high."
1918822,"The authors present part of a study concerning inherited retinal dystrophies as recorded among the inhabitants of the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region of France. This retrospective study, covering eighteen years (from 1972 to 1989) and covering a population of nearly 4 millions inhabitants, has enabled us to assess the prevalence of each disease. 1,660 cases have been detected and 650 pedigrees have been established. The spatial distribution of the patients in reference to their places of origin in relation to the spatial division of area into ""communes"" or districts roughly corresponded to the population density and revealed a few centres of dominant retinal dystrophies in rural areas. The analysis of the distribution and inheritance of the various forms of retinitis pigmentosa confirmed the results obtained in other recent and similar studies carried out in other countries. The age pyramid of the detected cases followed that of the population under surveillance. Detection of all dystrophies increased up to the age of 35, then followed the normal decreasing pattern for older generations. As for retinoschisis, detection usually took place in the first fifteen years after birth; for Stargardt's disease, it has occurred up to the age of 20 and for Best's dystrophy, the process was the most extensive and the slowest to appear. The global number of dystrophies studied, corresponded to a prevalence of 1:1,490, which allowed us to estimate that the number of cases in France was 33,800. If we apply the phenomenon to all the populations of the European Community, we must consider that more than 300,000 patients are now affected by disabling hereditary retinal dystrophies."
18808562,"Kimura disease (KD) is a rare, chronic inflammatory disease of unknown cause and is characterized by painless s.c. swellings and lymphadenopathy commonly affecting the head and neck region. Much therapeutics has been used to treat KD, but is not satisfactory because of frequent relapse. Imatinib has been reported previously to be useful for treatment of hypereosinophilic syndrome and may work by selectively blocking protein-tyrosine kinases, such as platelet-derived growth factor receptor, and c-Kit. We carried out immunohistochemical examination of platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha and c-Kit in tissues from patients with KD. The results were positive and suggested that Imatinib might be an effective drug for the treatment of the disease. We have also briefly reviewed the epidemiology, aetiology, clinical manifestations, laboratory and pathological examinations, differential diagnoses, treatment and prognosis of KD in this manuscript."
21301777,"Less than 50 patients are reported with platelet type von Willebrand disease (PT-VWD) worldwide. Several reports have discussed the diagnostic challenge of this disease versus the closely similar disorder type 2B VWD. However, no systematic study has evaluated this dilemma globally. Over three years, a total of 110 samples/data from eight countries were analysed. A molecular approach was utilised, analysing exon 28 of the von Willebrand factor (VWF) gene, and in mutation negative cases the platelet GP1BA gene. Our results show that 48 cases initially diagnosed as putative type 2B/PT-VWD carried exon 28 mutations consistent with type 2B VWD, 17 carried GP1BA mutations consistent with a PT-VWD diagnosis, three had other VWD types (2A and 2M) and five expressed three non-previously published exon 28 mutations. Excluding 10 unaffected family members and one acquired VWD, 26 cases did not have mutations in either genes. Based on our study, the percentage of type 2B VWD diagnosis is 44% while the percentage of misdiagnosis of PT-VWD is 15%. This is the first large international study to investigate the occurrence of PT-VWD and type 2B VWD worldwide and to evaluate DNA analysis as a diagnostic tool for a large cohort of patients. The study highlights the diagnostic limitations due to unavailability/poor application of RIPA and related tests in some centres and proposes genetic analysis as a suitable tool for the discrimination of the two disorders worldwide. Cases that are negative for both VWF and GP1BA gene mutations require further evaluation for alternative diagnoses."
18666317,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the commonest primary malignant cancer of the liver in the world. Given that the burden of chronic liver disease is expected to rise owing to increasing rates of alcoholism, hepatitis B and C prevalence and obesity-related fatty liver disease, it is expected that the incidence of HCC will also increase in the foreseeable future. This article summarizes the international epidemiology, the risk factors and the pathogenesis of HCC, including the roles of viral hepatitis, toxins, such as alcohol and aflatoxin, and insulin resistance."
16906556,"In 2000-2004, we performed a focused search for individuals with Angelman syndrome (AS) and Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) aiming to establish the prevalence data for the individuals born between 1984 and 2004 in Estonia. All persons with probable AS or PWS (n = 184) were studied using the DNA methylation test. Individuals with abnormal methylation were all further tested by chromosomal and FISH analysis, and if necessary for uniparental disomy and UBE3A gene mutation. Nineteen cases with abnormal methylation test result were identified. Seven of them had AS, including six (85.7%) due to 15q11-13 deletion and one paternal UPD15. Twelve subjects had PWS: 4 (33%) 15q11-13 deletions, 6 (50%) maternal UPD15, 1 unbalanced chromosome 14;15 translocation resulting in a chromosome 15pter-q13 deletion, and 1 Robertsonian 15q;15q translocation. The minimum livebirth prevalence in 1984-2004 for AS was 1:52,181 (95% CI 1:25,326-1:1,29,785) and for PWS 1:30,439 (95% CI 1:17,425-1:58,908). The livebirth prevalence of AS and PWS increased within this period, but the change was statistically significant only for PWS (P = 0.032), from expected 1:88,495 (95% CI 1:24,390-1:3,22,580) to expected 1:12,547 (95% CI 1:540-1:29,154). Six individuals with AS and 11 with PWS were alive on the prevalence day (January 1, 2005), indicating the point prevalence proportion of 1:56,112 (95% CI 1:25,780-1:1,52,899) and 1:30,606 (95% CI 1:17,105-1:61,311), respectively. Our results showing the birth prevalence of AS 1.7 times less than PWS challenge the opinion that both syndromes are equally represented, and are in line with the view that mutations in sperm and oocytes occur at different frequencies."
3259306,"The need for a reliable screening test for classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia prompted development of newborn screening programs. Worldwide incidence of classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia in this report was taken from newborn screening programs in France, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Scotland, and the United States. Two populations in which the occurrence of congenital adrenal hyperplasia among live births has been reported with greater than usual frequency are the Yupik Eskimos of southwestern Alaska (1:282) and the people of La Reunion, France (1:2,141). Aside from these populations, 1,093,310 newborns were screened between 1980 and 1988, of whom 77 had congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Thus, worldwide incidence of this disorder was estimated at 1:14,199 live births for homozygous patients, 1:60 for heterozygous subjects, with a gene frequency of 0.0083. Incidence of congenital adrenal hyperplasia among whites was estimated to be 1:11,909 (41:488,279) for homozygous patients, 1:55 for heterozygous subjects with a gene frequency of 0.0091. Incidence for the salt-wasting form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia was 1:18,850 (58:1,093,310) compared with 1:57,543 (19:1,093,310) for congenital adrenal hyperplasia in the simple virilizing form. Thus, salt-wasting congenital adrenal hyperplasia was three times more common than simple virilizing congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Estimated incidence of congenital adrenal hyperplasia in white populations in Italy and France (1:10,866) was higher than in Scotland (1:17,098), New Zealand (1:14,500). The incidence in an Asian population (Japan) (1:15,800) did not differ significantly from that of the white population. In four of five populations, overall incidence was higher than previously reported, as was the frequency of the salt-wasting form (75% v 50% to 66%), suggesting improved case detection by newborn screening.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
19016727,"Population-based plasmacytoma incidence and survival data are sparse. We analyzed incidence rates (IRs), IR ratios (IRRs), and 5-year relative survival for plasmacytoma overall and by site -- bone (P-bone) and extramedullary (P-extramedullary) -- in the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program (1992-2004). For comparison, we included cases of multiple myeloma (MM) diagnosed over the same time period in SEER. Incidence of MM (n = 23,544; IR 5.35/100,000 person-years) was 16-times higher than plasmacytoma overall (n = 1543; IR = 0.34), and incidence of P-bone was 40% higher than P-extramedullary (P < 0.0001). The male-to-female IRRs for P-bone, P-extramedullary, and MM were 2.0, 2.6, and 1.5, respectively. For plasmacytoma and MM, IRs were highest in Blacks, intermediate in Whites, and lowest in Asian/Pacific Islanders. Compared with Whites, the Black IR was approximately 30% higher for P-extramedullary and P-bone and 120% higher for MM. IRs for all neoplasms increased exponentially with advancing age, less prominently at older ages for plasmacytoma than MM. Distinct age, gender, and race incidence patterns of plasma cell disorders suggest underlying differences in clinical detection, susceptibility, disease biology and/or aetiological heterogeneity. Five-year relative survival for P-bone, P-extramedullary, and MM varied significantly by age (<60/60+ years), supporting age-related differences in disease burden at presentation, disease biology, and/or treatment approaches."
10666902,"OBJECTIVE: Apert syndrome is one of the five craniosynostosis syndromes caused by allelic mutations of the fibroblast growth-factor receptor 2 (FGFR2). It is characterized by symmetrical cutaneous and bony syndactyly of the hands and feet and a variety of pleiotrophic features of the skeleton, central nervous system, skin and internal organs. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We show the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of the 17 cases of Apert syndrome identified in a consecutive series of 26,956 malformed liveborn infants detected among 1,502,639 livebirths surveyed by the Spanish Collaborative Study of Congenital Malformations (CEMC) between April 1976 and March 1998. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The estimated frequency of Apert syndrome in Spain is 0.11 per 10,000 liveborn infants. All of the cases were sporadic and were associated with an increased paternal age. The clinical manifestations of our cases are concordant with the variable expression of the syndrome, with the cardinal features of acrocephaly secondary to craniosynostosis and syndactyly of hands and feet present in all cases, and other anomalies, including cardiovascular (23.5%), cleft palate (23.5%), urinary (5.9%) and central nervous system (5.9%), in some of the patients."
14999699,"There have been no population-based studies of the epidemiology and prognosis of patients with fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC). We conducted a retrospective cohort study using information collected by population-based registries of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program. The demographic features, stage at diagnosis, and type of therapy, as well as age-adjusted incidence rates and observed and relative survival rates were compared between persons with FLC and those with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) diagnosed between 1986 and 1999. A multivariate Cox proportional hazards model was constructed to examine the effect of histology (FLC vs. HCC) on the risk of mortality. There were 68 microscopically confirmed cases of FLC and 7,896 cases of HCC. FLC constituted 0.85% of all cases of primary liver cancer and 13.4% of all cases below the age of 40. Compared to HCC, patients with FLC were more likely to be younger (mean age 39 vs. 65), female (51.5% vs. 26.3%), and white (85.3% vs. 56.9%). A greater proportion of case with FLC had localized disease (41.2% vs. 30.9%), or received potentially curative therapy (resection, transplantation), compared to cases with HCC. The age-adjusted incidence rate for FLC was 0.02 per 100,000; No significant differences in age-adjusted incidence rates were observed by gender or race. The 1- and 5-year observed and relative survival rates were significantly longer in patients with FLC than HCC. The 5-year relative survival rate was 31.8% (95% CI, 20.5%-43.1%) for FLC, compared with 6.8% (95% CI, 6.3 %-7.4 %) for HCC. Adjusting for differences in age, gender, race, stage of disease, receipt of resection or transplantation, and time of diagnosis, FLC was independently associated with a 46% reduction in risk of mortality within 5 years compared with HCC. In conclusion, in a population-based study, we observed remarkable differences in the epidemiology and prognosis of FLC compared to HCC."
26738841,"Tularaemia is a zoonotic disease caused by Francisella tularensis, a Gram-negative, facultative intracellular bacterium. Typically, human and animal infections are caused by F tularensis subspecies tularensis (type A) strains mainly in Canada and USA, and F tularensis subspecies holarctica (type B) strains throughout the northern hemisphere, including Europe. In the past, the epidemiological, clinical, therapeutic, and prognostic aspects of tularaemia reported in the English medical literature were mainly those that had been reported in the USA, where the disease was first described. Tularaemia has markedly changed in the past decade, and a large number of studies have provided novel data for the disease characteristics in Europe. In this Review we aim to emphasise the specific and variable aspects of tularaemia in different European countries. In particular, two natural lifecycles of F tularensis have been described in this continent, although not fully characterised, which are associated with different modes of transmission, clinical features, and public health burdens of tularaemia."
23350618,"AIM: To determine the true prevalence of congenital heart disease (CHD) at live birth using echocardiographic screening. METHODS: A total of 5190 consecutive newborns from two secondary hospitals were included. Each neonate had a complete clinical evaluation with echocardiographic diagnosis at average 47 h of age. Newborns with persistent CHD underwent at least 4 months of follow-up, and the temporal trend of prevalence of mild CHD was assessed. RESULTS: Overall live birth prevalence of CHD was 26.6‰ (severe 3.5‰, moderate 5.4‰ and mild 17.7‰), and prevalence of CHD that could be detected by clinical evaluation was 12.1‰. The most common CHD was ventricular septal defect (VSD, 17.3‰), followed by atrial septal defect (ASD, 6.2‰), patent ductus arteriosus (PDA, 1.3‰), tetralogy of Fallot (TOF, 0.4‰), single ventricle (SV, 0.4‰), atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD, 0.2‰) and double outlet right ventricle (DORV, 0.2‰). Female predominance was observed in mild CHD (VSD, ASD), and male predominance was observed in severe CHD. The prevalence of CHD was reduced to 19.5‰ at the 4-month follow-up, which was largely caused by spontaneous closure rate of muscular VSD. CONCLUSION: Prevalence of CHD determined by echocardiography screening was higher but more accurate than that obtained from birth defect registries."
2240051,"A prevalence study of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) has been conducted in North Dakota. All pediatricians, neurologists, child psychiatrists, psychologists, and clinical geneticists were surveyed. The state's comprehensive evaluation center, the state hospital, the state institution for the mentally retarded, and group homes for the developmentally disabled, including one for persons with PWS, were also contacted. Seventeen patients were identified, 8 males, 8 females, and one patient whose sex was not specified. This suggests a prevalence rate of 1 per 16,062 in North Dakota."
21897393,"BACKGROUND: The reported incidence rates of vestibular schwannomas (VS) vary substantially, but it is unclear as to what extent the variation reflects differences in risk or recording practices. Our aim was to describe the incidence rates of VS in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden between 1987 and 2007. METHODS: Comprehensive data were available from all registries only for the period from 1987 to 2007. An analysis of a longer time period (1965-2007) was conducted with the Norwegian and Swedish data. RESULTS: The average age-standardised incidence rates during 1987-2007 varied from 6.1 per 1,000,000 person-years (95% confidence interval (CI), 5.4-6.7) among Finnish men to 11.6 (95% CI, 10.4-12.7) in Danish men, and from 6.4 per 1,000,000 person-years (95% CI, 5.7-7.0) among Swedish women to 11.6 (95% CI, 10.5-12.8) among Danish women. An overall annual increase of 3.0% (95% CI 2.1-3.9) was observed when all countries and both sexes were combined, with considerable differences between countries. However, the practices of both reporting and coding VS cases varied markedly between countries and over time, which poses a challenge for interpretation of the results. CONCLUSION: The overall incidence of VS increased in all the four Nordic countries combined between 1987 and 2007, with marked differences between countries. However, the incidence rates more or less stabilised in the late 1990s, showing relatively constant incidence rates and even some decline after 2000."
21527236,"PURPOSE: Using statewide data, we evaluated whether the changing incidence of penile anomalies and hypospadias is reflected in the diverse California population of newborn males over the past 20 years. METHODS: Discharge data from all California hospitals, prepared by the OSHPD (Sacramento, CA) was reviewed for the years 1985-2006 for male infant births with an ICD-9 code (752.6) for hypospadias, epispadias or other penile anomalies. Trends were examined by Generalized Estimation Equations for Poisson regression. RESULTS: From 1985 to 2006, the birth incidence of newborn penile anomalies increased in California from 47 to 57 cases per 10,000 newborn discharges, yet the trend for hypospadias alone appears stable from 1997. The rates for penile anomalies in newborns increased 1.4% annually (p < 0.001). All racial/ethnic groups analyzed showed this increase (p < 0.001 for each). During the study period there was a 2% increase per year in plural births (p < 0.001). Interestingly, the rate of change in penile anomaly incidence was greater in males of plural births compared to their singleton cohorts (2% vs 1% annually) (p < 0.001). The birth incidence of cleft palate, another congenital anomaly known to be stable over time, remained unchanged over this period. CONCLUSIONS: From 1985 to 2006 in California the incidence of penile anomalies increased in a statistically significant manner, but the incidence of hypospadias appears stable for the last decade. Our data support the notion that different racial/ethnic groups have distinct incidences of penile anomaly formation and that an association with plural births appears to be present."
23993194,"Whole-exome sequencing and autozygosity mapping studies, independently performed in subjects with defective combined mitochondrial OXPHOS-enzyme deficiencies, identified a total of nine disease-segregating FBXL4 mutations in seven unrelated mitochondrial disease families, composed of six singletons and three siblings. All subjects manifested early-onset lactic acidemia, hypotonia, and developmental delay caused by severe encephalomyopathy consistently associated with progressive cerebral atrophy and variable involvement of the white matter, deep gray nuclei, and brainstem structures. A wide range of other multisystem features were variably seen, including dysmorphism, skeletal abnormalities, poor growth, gastrointestinal dysmotility, renal tubular acidosis, seizures, and episodic metabolic failure. Mitochondrial respiratory chain deficiency was present in muscle or fibroblasts of all tested individuals, together with markedly reduced oxygen consumption rate and hyperfragmentation of the mitochondrial network in cultured cells. In muscle and fibroblasts from several subjects, substantially decreased mtDNA content was observed. FBXL4 is a member of the F-box family of proteins, some of which are involved in phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination and/or G protein receptor coupling. We also demonstrate that FBXL4 is targeted to mitochondria and localizes in the intermembrane space, where it participates in an approximately 400 kDa protein complex. These data strongly support a role for FBXL4 in controlling bioenergetic homeostasis and mtDNA maintenance. FBXL4 mutations are a recurrent cause of mitochondrial encephalomyopathy onset in early infancy."
15880727,"We investigated the molecular basis of hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) in 80 patients from 72 families by means of a PCR-based mutation screening strategy, consisting of heteroduplex analysis, restriction enzyme digest, DNA single strand electrophoresis, and direct sequencing. For a subset of patients mutation screening with DHPLC was established which turned out to be as fast and as sensitive as the more conventional methods. Fifteen different mutations of the aldolase B (ALDOB) gene were identified in HFI patients. As in smaller previous studies, p.A150P (65%), p.A175D (11%) and p.N335K (8%) were the most common mutated alleles, followed by c.360_363delCAAA, p.R60X, p.Y204X, and c.865delC. Eight novel mutations were identified in eight families with HFI: a small indel mutation (c.1044_1049delTTCTGGinsACACT), two small deletions (c.345_372del28; c.841_842delAC), two splice site mutations (c.113-1G>A, c.799+2T>A), one nonsense mutation (c.612T>G (p.Y204X)), and two missense mutations (c.532T>C (p.C178R), c.851T>C (p.L284P)). By mutation screening for the three most common ALDOB mutations by DHPLC in 2,000 randomly selected newborns we detected 21 heterozygotes. Based on these data and after correction for less common and private ALDOB mutations, HFI prevalence in central Europe is estimated to be 1:26,100 (95% confidence interval 1: 12,600-79,000)."
11456035,"BACKGROUND:Scleroderma is an autoimmune disorder of unknown cause. Previous epidemiological studies have suggested some regional clustering and associations with occupations involving exposure to silica dusts and hydrocarbons. AIMS:To determine: (i) prevalence and incidence of scleroderma in South Australia (SA), a state with a stable population living in well-defined urban, rural and industrial regions, (ii) hospital separation rates, (iii) cumulative survival rates, (iv) gender and disease subclassification, (v) geographical residency and occupations, (vi) familial associations and (vii) age at onset versus age-specific incidence rate. METHODS:Creation of the South Australian Scleroderma Register (SASR) to identify demographics and clinical and serological features of all scleroderma patients resident in SA. RESULTS:Scleroderma occurs in South Australia with a point prevalence of 23 per 10(5) and an incidence of approximately 1/15th of this. However, this prevalence is high compared with other regional world studies. Scleroderma is predominantly a female disease, with most patients having the limited form of scleroderma characterized by the presence of the anticentromere antibody and a mean survival of 27.6 years. In contrast, diffuse scleroderma is a less benign disease occurring at an early age of onset and has a mean survival of 9.6 years. Scleroderma occurs throughout SA without regional localization. Weak associations are seen in males, but not females, with occupations involving possible environmental exposure to silica or hydrocarbons. Scleroderma rarely occurs in families. CONCLUSION:No strong genetic or environmental influences were found to account for the relatively common occurrence of scleroderma in SA. The age at onset versus age-specific incidence curve suggests that scleroderma can be considered as a stochastic illness involving a number of random events occurring in a predisposed population. These random events may involve mutations of pivotal somatic genes."
20683956,"Population-based studies on the epidemiology of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) are sparse. The aim of the present study was to investigate prevalence and temporal trends in the incidence of PSC 1992-2005 in an adult population in Västra Götaland, a region in southern Sweden with a defined population of about 1.5 million. Patients with PSC aged 18 years or above were identified through a computerized search for diagnostic codes. A total number of 199 incident cases fulfilling Mayo criteria for PSC were identified through retrospective validation of clinical records. Temporal trends in the incidence of PSC were investigated by Poisson regression and expressed as average annual percent change (AAPC) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). The point prevalence of PSC on December 31, 2005, was 16.2/100,000 in the total adult population (men, 23.7/100,000; women, 8.9/100,000). The annual incidence was 1.22/100,000 in the total adult population (men, 1.78/100,000; women, 0.69/100,000). The overall incidence rate of PSC increased significantly over the investigation period (AAPC 3.06, 95% CI 0.01-6.20). Stratified analysis revealed significantly increasing trends for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-associated PSC (AAPC 7.01, 95% CI 0.24-14.24) and large duct PSC (AAPC 6.32, 95% CI 0.03-13.02) in women and for PSC without IBD (AAPC 9.69, 95% CI 0.82-19.33) and small duct PSC (AAPC 17.88, 95% CI 0.95-40.25) in men.This is the first study to report a significantly increasing trend in the incidence of PSC. The prevalence of PSC at the end of the study period is the highest reported to date. This implies that the medical burden of PSC may be higher than estimated previously."
21617320,"BACKGROUND:There has been no nationwide survey concerning peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) among the Asian population, and clinical profiles of PPCM complicated with hypertensive disorders complicating pregnancy (HD) as the major risk factor of PPCM have not been characterized. METHODS AND RESULTS:A retrospective, nationwide survey of PPCM in 2007 and 2008 all over Japan was performed and the clinical characteristics were compared between patients with and without HD. We obtained data for 102 patients. HD during pregnancy occurred in 42 patients (41%). Patients with HD were older than those without HD (33.8 vs. 31.9 years old, P<0.05) and babies were delivered more frequently by Caesarean section (81% vs. 52%, P<0.01). Although cardiac parameters at diagnosis were similar in patients with and without HD, patients with HD were hospitalized for a shorter period and had better cardiac function after 7 months. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that HD was independently associated with a shorter hospital stay and a higher left ventricular ejection fraction at last follow up. CONCLUSIONS:PPCM complicated with HD had different clinical characteristics from those without HD. This condition might be a unique subset of PPCM that is characterized by relatively swift recovery except in the cases of death. In order to prevent severe heart failure and maternal death, peripartum women should be treated with HD cautiously and must immediately undergo a cardiac examination as needed."
2706135,"Fifty-two patients with carcinoma of the fallopian tube diagnosed and treated during a 5-year period in Denmark were reviewed. The median age of the patients was 60 years. No patients had a preoperative diagnosis. History and clinical findings were similar to previously reported series. Treatment consisted of hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, often succeeded by postoperative whole pelvic irradiation. Five-year survival was 37.4%, depending on stage. In stage I+II the survival rates were similar regardless of whether postoperative radiation therapy had been given or not. Little is known about the patterns of spread. The relatively bad prognosis for stages I and II after radical surgery indicates early undetected metastases and the need for more aggressive adjunctive therapy."
2356798,"Cogenital smooth muscle hamartoma is a congenital skin lesion characterized by proliferation of bundles of smooth muscle within the reticular dermis. We report on a group of 15 children with this lesion, confirmed by skin biopsy specimen, its prevalence, the occurrence of associated anomalies, and long- term follow-up. To our knowledge, this is the largest group of patients with this lesion described in the literature. The estimated prevalence is about 1:2600 live births with slight male predominance. The lesion is most frequent in the lumbosacral area (67% [10/15]) and a positive pseudo-Darier's sign is present in 80% (12/15) of patients. During the follow-up period of up to 7 years, the lesions enlarged slightly but became less prominent. No malignant transformation was observed."
22713804,"This study examines trends and geographical differences in total and live birth prevalence of trisomies 21, 18 and 13 with regard to increasing maternal age and prenatal diagnosis in Europe. Twenty-one population-based EUROCAT registries covering 6.1 million births between 1990 and 2009 participated. Trisomy cases included live births, fetal deaths from 20 weeks gestational age and terminations of pregnancy for fetal anomaly. We present correction to 20 weeks gestational age (ie, correcting early terminations for the probability of fetal survival to 20 weeks) to allow for artefactual screening-related differences in total prevalence. Poisson regression was used. The proportion of births in the population to mothers aged 35+ years in the participating registries increased from 13% in 1990 to 19% in 2009. Total prevalence per 10000 births was 22.0 (95% CI 21.7-22.4) for trisomy 21, 5.0 (95% CI 4.8-5.1) for trisomy 18 and 2.0 (95% CI 1.9-2.2) for trisomy 13; live birth prevalence was 11.2 (95% CI 10.9-11.5) for trisomy 21, 1.04 (95% CI 0.96-1.12) for trisomy 18 and 0.48 (95% CI 0.43-0.54) for trisomy 13. There was an increase in total and total corrected prevalence of all three trisomies over time, mainly explained by increasing maternal age. Live birth prevalence remained stable over time. For trisomy 21, there was a three-fold variation in live birth prevalence between countries. The rise in maternal age has led to an increase in the number of trisomy-affected pregnancies in Europe. Live birth prevalence has remained stable overall. Differences in prenatal screening and termination between countries lead to wide variation in live birth prevalence."

OBJECTIVES: To find out the demographic characteristics and complications of patients with propionic acidemia. METHODS: The records of diagnosed cases of propionic acidaemia were reviewed, retrospectively. RESULTS: Of 24 patients, 16 (67%) were male. Consanguineous parents were 16 (67%). Ten (42%) patients had diseased siblings. Mean age at diagnosis was 0.13±0.27 year. Twenty-two (92%) patients had early onset and 2 (8%) had late onset disease. Eighteen (75%) patients had developmental delay, 11 (46%) had hypotonia, 3 (12%) had hypertonia, 13 (54%) had hyperreflexia and 12 (50%) had seizures. Two (8%) children each, had intracranial haemorrhage, spastic quadriplegia, hemiplegia and 1 (4%) had paraplegia. Cerebral atrophy and nasogastric/gastrotomy, tube feeding, each was found in 6 (25%) patients. Under nutrition was revealed in 20 (83%), short stature in 18 (75%), rickets in 1 (4%) and pancreatitis in 2 (8%) patients. During metabolic crisis, cerebral oedema and pancytopenia each were found in 4 (17%), hypoglycaemia in 6 (25%), hyperglycaemia in 2 (8%), hyperammonaemia in all 24 (100%) and metabolic acidosis in 20 (83%) cases. CONCLUSION: Propionic acidaemia is a rare hereditary disorder that has wide spectrum of neurological and other complications, which perhaps with early diagnosis and intervention may be preventable, more effectively."
18708296,"Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is an innate immunodeficiency due to a genetic defect in one of the NADPH-oxidase components. In the course of 21 years, 38 Israeli CGD patients were diagnosed with 17 gene mutations, seven of which were new. Clinical, functional, and molecular studies were accomplished. Although X-linked recessive (XLR)-CGD is worldwide the most common genotype of the disease (~70%), in our study only 11 patients (29%) suffered from XLR-CGD. In Israel, the higher incidence of the autosomal recessive (AR) form of CGD (63%) may be related to consanguineous marriages. In three patients (8%), all four proteins of the NADPH oxidase were present. Severe clinical expression was found both in the XLR and AR forms, but in general a milder disease was evident in AR-CGD, particularly in patients with p47(phox) deficiency. Despite early and aggressive therapy, a mortality rate of 26% was noted. Given that bone-marrow transplantation was successful in five of seven patients, it is recommended to perform it as early as possible before tissue damage is irreversible."
16764197,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS:Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare cutaneous malignancy. The aims of this study were to look at the incidence and distribution of MCC in a predominantly skin type I Caucasian population, review overall management of the disease and assess patient outcomes. METHODS:Cases were identified through the regional pathology database. Twenty patients were diagnosed with MCC over a 10-year period (1993-2003) and managed at the Regional Plastic Surgery Unit at St John's Hospital, Livingston. RESULTS:The disease incidence was found to be 0.133 per 100,000 per annum. All patients were Caucasian, seven males and 13 females (1:1.9 ratio). The mean age at presentation was 77 years (range 58-93 years). The majority of lesions were found to be stage IA (80%), located in the head and neck region. There were two cases (10%) with stage II disease and two (10%) with stage III disease (both with liver metastases) at the time of diagnosis. All patients were managed operatively. Seventeen of the 20 had wide local excisions; of the remaining three, two were only suitable for debulking procedures and one patient (stage II) had only a diagnostic biopsy, refusing intervention thereafter. One patient received adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. CONCLUSION:Surgery remains the mainstay of treatment but adjuvant therapy, in particular chemotherapy, is problematic in a frail, elderly population."
16964808,"OBJECTIVES: To analyse the incidence, aetiology and management of live born cases of hydrops fetalis in a Regional Perinatal Centre. METHODS: We reviewed 35 cases of hydrops delivered over a six year period. RESULTS: Non-immune hydrops accounted for 80% of the cases and the majority of babies required Level 1 intensive care. The mortality rate was 40%. CONCLUSION: The pattern of hydrops is changing. Most of these babies now have non-immune hydrops and approximately two thirds are surviving."
22034926,"OBJECTIVES: The establishment of variations in the incidence of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in the Faroese population from that found in other general populations may point to risk factors for the development of this disease among the Faroese. The aim of this study was to estimate the annual incidence of ALS during the period 1987-2009 and to compare the occurrence of ALS in the Faroe Islands with data from three European countries. METHOD: All Faroese patients diagnosed with ALS in this period are documented in the current longitudinal prospective study. RESULTS: The incidence of ALS in the Faroe Islands during the period 1987-2009 is 2.6 (1.7-3.7) per 100,000 annually. The results yielded no strong evidence of a difference (P = 0.09) in the incidence of ALS between Faroe Islands and Europe. The sample population is small, and this, of course, impacts the statistical precision of the findings. CONCLUSION: The data clearly suggest, however, that the Faroese population is probably not subject to an increased risk of ALS, even though certain risk factors are present in the general population: (i) a fish-based diet contaminated with mercury and polychlorinated biphenyl; (ii) the high occurrence of the recessive carnitine transporter genetic defect; and (iii) the anticipated high degree of inbreeding at the fifth generation."
8700304,"After the DNA diagnosis, we evaluated the prevalence of Huntington's disease (HD) in the San-in area of Japan, and confirmed the founder effect. There were 10 patients with HD in the San-in area, who were diagnosed clinically. The expansion of the CAG repeat was observed in 9 patients with HD members in their families, although those family members of the patients had already died. In the patient who had no positive family history, expansion of the CAG repeat was not seen. The prevalence of HD was 065/100,000 in this area. The common haplotype studied by the polymorphism marker of D4S136 was shown in all 9 HD patients, although they were observed in only 2.7% of the normal population. These results suggested a common ancestor of these HD patients."
30488239,"OBJECTIVE:Prior studies on the epidemiology of Whipple's disease are limited by small sample size and case series design. We sought to characterize the epidemiology of Whipple's disease in the USA utilizing a large population-based database. METHODS:We queried a commercial database (Explorys Inc, Cleveland, OH), an aggregate of electronic health record data from 26 major integrated healthcare systems in the USA. We identified a cohort of patients with a diagnosis of Whipple's disease based on systemized nomenclature of medical terminology (SNOMED CT) codes. We calculated the overall and age-, race-, ethnicity, and gender-based prevalence of Whipple's disease and prevalence of associated diagnoses using univariate analysis. RESULTS:A total of 35,838,070 individuals were active in the database between November 2012 and November 2017. Of these, 350 individuals had a SNOMED CT diagnosis of Whipple's disease, with an overall prevalence of 9.8 cases per 1 million. There was no difference in prevalence based on sex. However, prevalence of Whipple's disease was higher in Caucasians, non-Hispanics, and individuals > 65 years old. Individuals with a diagnosis of Whipple's disease were more likely to have associated diagnoses/findings of arthritis, CNS disease, endocarditis, diabetes, malignancy, dementia, vitamin D deficiency, iron deficiency, chemotherapy, weight loss, abdominal pain, and lymphadenopathy. CONCLUSIONS:To our knowledge, this is the largest study to date examining the epidemiology of Whipple's disease. In this large population-based study, the overall prevalence of Whipple's disease in the USA is 9.8 cases per 1 million people. It affects men and women at similar rates and is more common in Caucasians, non-Hispanics, and people > 65 years old."
2012513,"The incidence of tuberous sclerosis complex in Olmsted County, Minnesota, was 0.28 per 100,000 person-years from 1950 through 1989, the point prevalence on December 31, 1989, was 6.9 per 100,000 persons, and the incidence at birth was 6.0 per 100,000 live births. The incidence was 0.13 per 100,000 person-years from 1950 through 1974 and 0.46 per 100,000 person-years from 1975 through 1989. The higher rate of diagnosis during the later period is believed to be due to the use of computed tomography. Of the 12 patients considered in this study, one patient presented with seizures and severe intellectual disability, six patients presented with seizures, three patients presented with multiple facial angiofibroma, and two patients were asymptomatic."
1999344,"We have calculated the incidence of Menkes disease for Denmark, France, The Netherlands, the United Kingdom and West Germany, based on known Menkes patients born during the time period 1976-87. Considering live-born Menkes patients, the combined incidence for these five countries is 1 Menkes patient per 298,000 live-born babies. If the number of affected aborted fetuses are taken into account, the incidence is 1 Menkes per 254,000 live-born babies. This incidence, which is 2-4 times lower than earlier published incidence figures, places Menkes disease as an extremely rare disease. The mutation rate for Menkes disease is estimated to be 1.96 x 10(-6), based on the number of isolated Menkes cases born during the time period 1976-87 and the total number of newborn males during this time."
16964297,"AIMS: To determine the prevalence of myotonic dystrophy (DM) in Otago, the ethnic distribution of the disease, any founder effect, the complications and adequacy of health care, and the quality of life of sufferers in this region. METHODS: DM patients were identified through hospital records and assessed using a structured questionnaire, neurological examination, and review of hospital records. Quality of life was evaluated using the SF-36 Health Survey, and compared to patients with other neuromuscular conditions and New Zealand norms. RESULTS: 21 patients were identified, giving a prevalence of 11.6 per 100,000. All were of European descent. There was no evidence of a common ancestor. Not all patients had had essential investigations such as electrocardiogram and many had not been seen by the genetic service. DM patients had higher scores on the bodily pain subscale of the SF-36 Health Survey, compared to neuromuscular controls and the general population. Subjects differed significantly from New Zealand norms on four of the eight subscales. CONCLUSIONS: DM is relatively common in Europeans in Otago, but we found no cases in other ethnic groups. The disease affects aspects of quality of life, and management could be improved by use of a clinical care pathway."
30661430,"Background Norwood surgery provides a palliative surgical option for hypoplastic left heart syndrome and has been available in Sweden since 1993. The practice of prenatal ultrasound screening was gradually implemented in the same era, resulting in an increased prenatal detection rate. Our primary aims were to study changes in the incidence of live births, prenatal detection rate, and the termination of pregnancies over time. The secondary aims were to study the proportion of live-borns undergoing surgery and to identify factors that influenced whether surgery was or was not performed. Methods and Results Neonates with hypoplastic left heart syndrome with aortic atresia born 1990-2010 were identified through national databases, surgical files, and medical records. The fetal incidence was estimated from the period when prenatal screening was rudimentary. The study period was divided into the presurgical, early surgical, and late surgical periods. The incidence was calculated as the overall yearly incidence for each time period and sex separately. Factors influencing whether surgery was performed were analyzed using Cox-logistic regression. The incidence at live birth decreased from 15.4 to 8.4 per 100 000. The prenatal detection rate increased from 27% to 63%, and terminations increased from 19% to 56%. The odds of having surgery was higher in the late period and higher in the group with prenatal diagnosis. Conclusions We observed a decrease in incidence of live-borns with hypoplastic left heart syndrome aortic atresia. There was in increase in prenatal detection rate and an increase in termination of pregnancy. The proportion of live-borns who underwent surgery increased between time periods."
16191856,"There are varying reports on the prevalence of risk factors in porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT). We reviewed 84 patients with PCT in a restricted uptake area in Gothenburg, Sweden and evaluated different potential risk factors for the disease and complications. Besides a thorough medical history, the patients were investigated with urinary porphyrin analyses, transferrin saturation, ferritin and liver tests. Subsamples of patients were tested for antibodies to hepatitis C virus (n = 68), haemochromatosis gene mutations (n = 58) and with the oral glucose tolerance test (n = 31). We found a prevalence of about 1 patient with PCT in 10 000 inhabitants. Nineteen (23%) patients reported heredity for PCT. Identified risk factors were alcohol abuse (38% of male patients), oestrogen treatment (55% of female patients), anti-hepatitis C virus positivity (29% of male patients), diabetes (17%) or impaired glucose tolerance (45% of tested patients) and haemochromatosis gene mutations (57% of tested patients). All patients positive for anti-hepatitis C virus belonged to the non-hereditary group. During follow-up we observed a high incidence of stroke, no case of hepatocellular carcinoma and a normal life expectancy."
23845172,"AIM:We have never known any epidemiological study of Arima syndrome since it was first described in 1971. To investigate the number of Arima syndrome patients and clarify the clinical differences between Arima syndrome and Joubert syndrome, we performed the first nationwide survey of Arima syndrome, and herein report its results. Furthermore, we revised the diagnostic criteria for Arima syndrome. METHODS:As a primary survey, we sent out self-administered questionnaires to most of the Japanese hospitals with a pediatric clinic, and facilities for persons with severe motor and intellectual disabilities, inquiring as to the number of patients having symptoms of Arima syndrome, including severe psychomotor delay, agenesis or hypoplasia of cerebellar vermis, renal dysfunction, visual dysfunction and with or without ptosis-like appearance. Next, as the second survey, we sent out detailed clinical questionnaires to the institutes having patients with two or more typical symptoms. RESULTS:The response rate of the primary survey was 72.7% of hospitals with pediatric clinic, 63.5% of national hospitals and 66.7% of municipal and private facilities. The number of patients with 5 typical symptoms was 13 and that with 2-4 symptoms was 32. The response rate of the secondary survey was 52% (23 patients). After reviewing clinical features of 23 patients, we identified 7 Arima syndrome patients and 16 Joubert syndrome patients. Progressive renal dysfunction was noticed in all Arima syndrome patients, but in 33% of those with Joubert syndrome. CONCLUSION:It is sometimes difficult to distinguish Arima syndrome from Joubert syndrome. Some clinicians described a patient with Joubert syndrome and its complications of visual dysfunction and renal dysfunction, whose current diagnosis was Arima syndrome. Thus, the diagnosis of the two syndromes may be confused. Here, we revised the diagnostic criteria for Arima syndrome."
15480380,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the incidence and point prevalence of Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) in Canada; to determine the percentage of mild cases of SLOS; and to determine the age of diagnosis of mildly affected patients. SLOS is a treatable genetic condition that may be difficult to diagnose in its mildest form because of nonspecific clinical markers (two- to three-toe webbing, short upturned nose, and micrognathia). STUDY DESIGN: More than 2000 Canadian pediatricians and pediatric specialists were surveyed monthly for 36 months through a standing national surveillance program. A clinical identification form was designed to identify patients with SLOS or its phenocopies. Clinical information was obtained on all reported cases; suggested cases were investigated by biochemical or molecular analysis. RESULTS: Thirty-five of 86 reports of suggested SLOS were confirmed SLOS. Twelve infants with SLOS were born during the surveillance period, and two additional infants with SLOS were diagnosed prenatally. Twenty-one infants with SLOS were born before the onset of surveillance. CONCLUSIONS: The minimum incidence of SLOS in Canada is 1 in 70,358 live births. The minimum prevalence of SLOS is approximately 1 in 950,000. Eighteen percent of patients were mildly affected; the mean age of diagnosis of mildly affected patients was 5.3 years."
24451228,"Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) is one of the most genetically heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorders characterized by progressive spasticity and pyramidal weakness of lower limbs. Because >30 causative genes have been identified, screening of multiple genes is required for establishing molecular diagnosis of individual patients with HSP. To elucidate molecular epidemiology of HSP in the Japanese population, we have conducted mutational analyses of 16 causative genes of HSP (L1CAM, PLP1, ATL1, SPAST, CYP7B1, NIPA1, SPG7, KIAA0196, KIF5A, HSPD1, BSCL2, SPG11, SPG20, SPG21, REEP1 and ZFYVE27) using resequencing microarrays, array-based comparative genomic hybridization and Sanger sequencing. The mutational analysis of 129 Japanese patients revealed 49 mutations in 46 patients, 32 of which were novel. Molecular diagnosis was accomplished for 67.3% (33/49) of autosomal dominant HSP patients. Even among sporadic HSP patients, mutations were identified in 11.1% (7/63) of them. The present study elucidated the molecular epidemiology of HSP in the Japanese population and further broadened the mutational and clinical spectra of HSP."
18050337,"BACKGROUND: Recent studies reported no reduction in the frequency of lipomeningomyelocele (LMMC) in Hawaii and Nova Scotia after the implementation of a folic acid food fortification policy in 1998, while a marked reduction in the prevalence of other NTDs was observed. This study was performed to assess the prevalence of LMMC in Canada in relation to the timing of food fortification. METHODS: The study population included livebirths, stillbirths, and terminations of pregnancies because of fetal anomaly to women residing in seven Canadian provinces, from 1993 to 2002. In each province, the ascertainment of NTD cases relied on multiple sources, and in addition all medical charts were reviewed. The study period was divided into pre-, partial, and full fortification periods, based on results of red cell folate tests published in the literature. RESULTS: A total of 86 LMMC cases were recorded among approximately 1.9 million live births. The average birth prevalence rate was 0.05/1,000, ranging from a minimum of 0.01/1,000 in 2002 to a maximum of 0.08/1,000 in 1999. There was statistical heterogeneity between years (p = .01), but no pattern compatible with a decrease following fortification. Comparing the full fortification period with the prefortification period, there was a slight but not statistically significant decrease in LMMC birth prevalence. CONCLUSIONS: LMMC seems to be pathogenically distinct from myelomeningocele and more studies are needed to understand the embryologic mechanisms leading to this condition, and the environmental and genetic factors involved in its etiology."
9392014,"Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is considered frequent among French Canadians. Our previous observations suggested it is common also among the Jews originating from Bukhara in Uzbekistan, many of whom are now living in Israel. One hundred and seventeen OPMD patients were identified in a population of 70,000 people of Bukharian descent, resulting in a calculated minimal prevalence of 1:600. In all but three families age dependent autosomal dominant inheritance was documented. There is some evidence for genetic anticipation. Three young, severely ill, patients from two different families may be homozygotes, their parents being both affected. Bukhara Jews present the second largest known cluster and the prevalence is the highest in the world. The existence of very large families, intermarriage among carriers and probably homozygote offspring may be useful for genetic studies. A 'founder effect' may explain the high prevalence of OPMD in this population."
20587361,"When immunocompetent people become infected with the parasite Toxoplasma gondii, the disease is generally asymptomatic. However, transplacental transmission of T. gondii may lead to severe congenital infection including in utero abortion, foetal death, or neurological or ocular damage of the foetus. France has had a national programme to prevent congenital toxoplasmosis since 1978. However, although estimated seroprevalence in pregnant women has fallen from 84% in the 1960s to 44% in 2003, no reliable data have been available on the annual number of cases of congenital toxoplasmosis or the severity of infection. In 2006, the French National Institute for Public Health Surveillance (Institut de Veille Sanitaire) and the National Reference Centre for Toxoplasmosis recommended that a national laboratory-based surveillance system be used for the surveillance of the disease. In 2007, 31 laboratories reported at least one congenital case through the surveillance system, giving a total of 272 cases. A total of 11 terminations of pregnancy were reported (six abortions and five foetal deaths). Of the live-born cases, 206 were asymptomatic, 28 were symptomatic and seven had a severe form of the disease. As there were 818,700 births in France and French overseas departments in 2007, the overall prevalence of congenital toxoplasmosis observed that year was 3.3 (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.9 to 3.7) per 10,000 live births and the incidence rate of the disease at birth was 2.9 (95% CI: 2.5 to 3.2) per 10,000 live births; the estimated incidence rate of symptomatic congenital toxoplasmosis was 0.34 (95% CI: 0.2 to 0.5) cases per 10,000 live births."
23486543,"Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder resulting in pathological progressive copper accumulation in liver and other tissues. The worldwide prevalence (P) is about 30/million, while in Sardinia it is in the order of 1/10,000. However, all of these estimates are likely to suffer from an underdiagnosis bias. Indeed, a recent molecular neonatal screening in Sardinia reported a WD prevalence of 1:2707. In this study, we used a new approach that makes it possible to estimate the allelic frequency (q) of an autosomal recessive disorder if one knows the proportion between homozygous and compound heterozygous patients (the homozygosity index or HI) and the inbreeding coefficient (F) in a sample of affected individuals. We applied the method to a set of 178 Sardinian individuals (3 of whom born to consanguineous parents), each with a clinical and molecular diagnosis of WD. Taking into account the geographical provenance of the parents of every patient within Sardinia (to make F computation more precise), we obtained a q=0.0191 (F=7.8 × 10(-4), HI=0.476) and a corresponding prevalence P=1:2732. This result confirms that the prevalence of WD is largely underestimated in Sardinia. On the other hand, the general reliability and applicability of the HI approach to other autosomal recessive disorders is confirmed, especially if one is interested in the genetic epidemiology of populations with high frequency of consanguineous marriages."
20148377,"BACKGROUND: Sparse data is available on the incidence of endocrine disorders among children in Germany. AIM: A pioneer study was established to analyse, in the German states of Baden-Wuerttemberg (BW) and Bavaria (BY), the incidence and prevalence of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (AGS; CAH), precocious puberty (PP), primary congenital hypothyreosis (PCH), Graves disease (MB), and growth disorders related to the Ullrich-Turner syndrome (UTS) and growth hormone deficiency (GHD). METHODS: Participation in the study involved each paediatric hospital in BW and BY (n = 63),and all regional paediatricians belonging to the Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians (SHI) practising in these states (n = 1 443). Data collection was done from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2001, and included all patients in the 0- < 18 age range. RESULTS: Completeness of data was 81 % for CAH and 55 % for UTS (capture-mark-recapture method).The incidence rate (IR, per 100 000 / year)versus prevalence rate (per 100 000 at the time point December 31, 2001) was: CAH 0.64 vs.9.60; PP 2.42 vs. 10,85; PCH 1.88 vs. 14.97; MB 0.89 vs. 3.25; UTS 2.15 vs. 29.07; and GHD 3.47(IR). Among neonates, the incidence of CAH was 1 / 7 794; PCH 1 / 2 629 and UTS 1 / 2 300. CONCLUSIONS: A pioneer study has been established in Germany for investigating the frequency of AGS (CAH), PP, PCH, MB, UTS, and GHD among children and adolescents. Our data shows that these disorders occur in approx. 2,700 children per year in total Germany, and about 12 000 of these children need to be treated in specialized paediatric endocrinological centres."
19013100,"Relatively few epidemiologic studies have focused on narcolepsy, a disabling sleep disorder with a strong association with HLA-DQB1 *0602.We sought to estimate the prevalence of narcolepsy using multiple overlapping techniques to identify residents of King County, WA who were 18 years or older with physician-diagnosed narcolepsy. Patients were entered into a registry and recruited into an epidemiologic study entailing interview and buccal scrapings to determine HLA-DQB1 *0602 status. Missing values were imputed to allow prevalence to be estimated based on all 425 patients entered into the registry between 2001 and 2005, whether they were recruited into the epidemiologic study (n=279) or not (n=146).As of July 01, 2001, estimated prevalence per 100,000 of physician-diagnosed narcolepsy with cataplexy was 21.8 (95% confidence interval (CI): 18.8-24.8), similar to prior studies. The median age of onset was 14 (interquartile range: 10-18). For narcolepsy with HLA-DQB1 *0602, prevalence was 15.3 (95% CI: 12.8-17.9). Estimated prevalence was higher in women than men and in African-Americans than other racial groups.These differences could reflect problems in identification and recruitment or may provide etiologic clues about narcolepsy. This study illustrates the challenges in performing population-based studies of narcolepsy."
20737418,"BACKGROUND: Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors are highly malignant embryonal central nervous system (CNS) tumors that were defined as an entity in 1996. As compared with other malignant CNS tumors, their biological behavior is particularly aggressive, but patients may benefit from an intensified treatment. Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors display a complex histomorphology, which renders them prone to misdiagnosis. They occur predominantly in young children, with an estimated prevalence of 1% to 2% among all pediatric CNS tumors. However, population-based data on the incidence of these tumors are not yet available. METHODS: A nation-wide survey of malignant high-grade CNS tumors (World Health Organization grade III/IV), diagnosed in children (aged birth to 14 years) from 1996 to 2006 was conducted by the Austrian Brain Tumor Registry. A central histopathology review was performed including the assessment of SMARCB1 (INI1) protein status. RESULTS: A total of 311 newly diagnosed, malignant CNS tumors were included. Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors constituted the sixth most common entity (6.1%), referring to an age-standardized incidence rate of 1.38 per 1,000,000 person-years in children. Peak incidence was found in the birth to 2 years age group, where they were as common as CNS primitive neuroectodermal tumors and medulloblastomas. A total of 47.4% of atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors were initially diagnosed, whereas 52.6% were retrospectively detected by the central review. The 5-year survival of atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor patients was 39.5%, with 66.7% in the correctly diagnosed group versus 15.0% in the not recognized group (P = .0469). CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians and pathologists should be aware of the high incidence of atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors in young children to optimize diagnostic and therapeutic management of patients with these tumors."
14639690,"The aim of this cross-sectional study was to estimate the prevalence of different subtypes of idiopathic focal dystonia in the population of Belgrade (Serbia), Yugoslavia. On December 31, 2001, the crude prevalence of all studied types of dystonia (focal, segmental, and multifocal) in Belgrade was 13.6 per 100,000 population (11.8 per 100,000 for men and 15.2 per 100,000 for women). Type-specific prevalence for focal dystonia was 11.2 per 100,000. The prevalence for cervical dystonia, blepharospasm, writer's cramp and laryngeal dystonia were 5.9 per 100,000, 1.9 per 100,000, 1.9 per 100,000, and 1.1 per 100,000, respectively."
12192735,"Toxic oil syndrome burst upon the scene in Spain in May of 1981, draining the resources of a newly evolving political and social medicine system. The vehicle of the causative toxic agent was identified as an illicit oil that had been diverted from industrial use and refined in order to remove the aniline denaturant, and that was sold in unlabeled 5-liter containers by itinerant salesmen. Over 20,000 people were ultimately affected, and over 1,200 deaths from all causes have been recorded in the affected cohort. The epidemiologic investigation of toxic oil syndrome involved all facets of investigative and analytical work; from visits to factories and interviewing workers, to sophisticated chemical and statistical analytical techniques. This investigation serves as a further illustration that data and information of all types, and from a wide range of fields, need to be systematically collected and evaluated in order to best resolve an epidemiologic mystery. Astute clinical observation of the patients, however, led to the hypothesis that toxic oil syndrome was a result of a toxic exposure. In this and other epidemics of unknown etiology, clinical observation and the intense scrutiny of patients' histories, signs, and symptoms by treating clinicians have often led to hypotheses that could be tested epidemiologically. When there are medical unknowns, the role of the astute clinician continues to be crucial. The toxic oil syndrome epidemic is an example of how even a developed country can be affected by a massive epidemic of environmental origin if failures occur in the systems that control and regulate the food supply or other consumer products. However, such failures could occur anywhere that large commercial networks operate on the regulatory edge, and if these business lack an in depth knowledge of the consequences of alterations in manufacturing conditions. Such was the case with eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome as well, when apparently minor alterations in manufacturing conditions of L-tryptophan led to an increase in impurities in the product that were later associated with the illness. These risks are even greater in countries with few or inconsistent control systems, making the food and drug supply potential portals of entry for serious health hazards, as is further exemplified by the tragic episode of pediatric renal failure in Haiti associated with a legitimate consumer product, paracetamol elixir, that had been manufactured using a fraudulently supplied toxic ingredient, diethylene glycol (81). The potential toxicants in the adulterated rapeseed oil were present in extremely small amounts. If fatty acid anilides or related compounds are indeed the etiologic agents in toxic oil syndrome, then these compounds must be extremely toxic at the parts per million concentrations at which they were found. Further, the roles of causative agents in the development of disorders such as scleroderma, eosinophilic fasciitis, eosinophilic perimyositis, and other similar diseases are unknown, but scientists can speculate that some sort of low level environmental agent may play a role if such extremely small quantities of contaminants are indeed capable of causing disease. Although the exact identity of the etiologic agent in toxic oil syndrome remains unknown, work on toxic oil syndrome continues. Follow-up clinical studies and long-term mortality studies are under way. Investigation of the mechanisms involved in toxic oil syndrome continues. The identification of suspect chemical compounds, their characterization, and effects will hopefully one day contribute to the prevention of other similar diseases."
2359725,"To determine the occurrence of hereditary bullous epidermolyses (EB) in Croatia, Yugoslavia, from 1960 to 1987, cases were gathered from the hospital files of dermatologic and pediatric clinics and departments throughout the area. The diagnosis of EB type was made on the basis of clinical features, patients' histories, and light microscopy and electron microscopy findings. Fifty families with 58 patients were registered; 44 patients were examined personally by one of the authors. The most frequent type of EB in Croatia was recessive dystrophic EB Hallopeau-Siemens, occurring in 35 of the 58 individuals. Regional accumulation of cases within the Varazdin area was noted (13 patients). Prevalence of EB in Croatia is 0.956 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. One case of recessive dystrophic EB Hallopeau-Siemens occurred in about every 52,000 live births."
15329827,"BACKGROUND: Holoprosencephaly (HPE) is one of the most common developmental disorders of the brain associated with specific craniofacial dysmorphogenesis. Although numerous postnatal cases have been reported, early phases of its pathogenesis are not well understood. We examined over 200 cases of HPE human embryos both grossly and histologically, and studied their phenotypic variability and stage-specific characteristics. METHODS: Among over 44,000 human embryos in the Kyoto Collection of Human Embryos, 221 embryos have been diagnosed as HPE. Their developmental stages ranged from Carnegie stage (CS) 13 to CS 23. They were examined grossly and were also serially sectioned for detailed histological analysis. RESULTS: HPE embryos after CS 18 were classified into complete (true) cyclopia, synophthalmia (partially fused eyes in a single eye fissure), closely apposed separate eyes (possible forerunners of ethmocephaly and cebocephaly), and milder HPE with median cleft lip (premaxillary agenesis). At CS 13-17, when facial morphogenesis is not completed, HPE embryos had some facial characteristics that are specific to these stages and different from those in older HPE embryos. The midline structures of the brain, including the pituitary gland, were lacking or seriously hypoplastic in HPE embryos. Complete cyclopia was found in two cases after CS 18 but none at earlier stages. CONCLUSIONS: The early development of HPE in human embryos was systematically studied for the first time. The pathogenesis of craniofacial abnormalities, especially eye anomalies, in HPE was discussed in the light of recent studies with mutant laboratory animals."
3065352,"This first report of a Swiss registry includes 313 patients with primary immunodeficiency syndromes (PIDS) who were observed between January 1975 and January 1985. Diagnosis of specific PIDS was made according to WHO criteria. The most frequent disorders were IgA deficiency (33%) and common variable immunodeficiency (22%), followed by selective deficiency of other immunoglobulin isotypes (9%), severe combined immunodeficiency (9%), infantile sex-linked agammaglobulinemia (7%), and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (6%). Frequencies of other types of PIDS varied between 0.3 and 4%. Half of the patients were in the pediatric age group. Male patients predominated (63%). In addition to respiratory and urogenital tract infections, autoimmune disorders were observed in 14 patients with IgA deficiency or common variable immunodeficiency. IgA deficiency was, furthermore, associated with atopic and neurological disorders. A comparison with other national registries revealed some differences: the frequency of severe combined immunodeficiency was high (incidence, 24.3 cases per 10(6) live births), and that of ataxia teleangiectasia was particularly low (1.4 per 10(6) live births) in Switzerland. Frequencies of the three major PIDS groups of (i) predominantly antibody defects, (ii) predominantly cell-mediated defects, and (iii) PIDS associated with other major defects agreed with those reported in the other European studies."
23679015,"There is little information about the prevalence and disease burden of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP), multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) and paraproteinaemic demyelinating neuropathy (PDN).Multiple sources were used to study the prevalence and clinical features of these diseases in a southeast England population of 3,557,352 people.The crude prevalences were as follows: CIDP, 2.84 (95% CI 2.31-3.45); MMN, 0.53 (95% CI 0.32-0.83); and PDN, 1.04 (95% CI 0.73-1.43) per 100,000 population. All three diseases were more common in men than in women. The peak decade of onset was older in those with CIDP (70-79 years) and PDN (70-79 years) than in those with MMN (50-59 years). Disability was greater in CIDP and PDN, with median (range) overall neuropathy limitations scores of 4 (0-8) and 4 (1-6), respectively, than in MMN, with a score of 2 (1-5).The common forms of chronic inflammatory neuropathy cause a considerable disease burden in the community."
7161034,"A descriptive epidemiological survey of Myotonia Congenita (MC) and Myotonic Dystrophy (MD) was carried out on the resident population of the City of Turin, Italy. Cases were collected from the Archives of the Neurological Clinic, University of Turin, and from other neurological departments in the city's hospitals. Every patient (and the ""healthy"" relatives of MD subjects) underwent clinical and EMG re-examination, in order to confirm the initial diagnosis and to investigate the familial distribution of the diseases. The point prevalence rate was 0.9 (+/- 0.6) X 10(-5) for MC and 2.1 (+/- 0.8) X 10(-5) for MD. During the period 1955-1979 the mean annual incidence was 0.3 (+/- 0.2) X 10(-6) for MC and 0.7 (+/- 0.3) X 10(-6) for MD. The incidence-at-birth rate was 1.4 (+/- 1.2) X 10(-5) for MC and 2.9 (+/- 1.8) X 10(-5) for MD. The modalities of inheritance and sex distribution of MC and MD were also studied. Knowledge of epidemiological features of these myopathies is of vital importance for genetic counselling."
21752289,"BACKGROUND: Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) results from mutations in the SERPINA1 gene and classically presents with early-onset emphysema and liver disease. The most common mutation presenting with clinical evidence is the Z mutation, while the S mutation is associated with a milder plasma deficiency. AATD is an under-diagnosed condition and the World Health Organisation recommends targeted detection programmes for AATD in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), non-responsive asthma, cryptogenic liver disease and first degree relatives of known AATD patients. METHODS: We present data from the first 3,000 individuals screened following ATS/ERS guidelines as part of the Irish National Targeted Detection Programme (INTDP). We also investigated a DNA collection of 1,100 individuals randomly sampled from the general population. Serum and DNA was collected from both groups and mutations in the SERPINA1 gene detected by phenotyping or genotyping. RESULTS: The Irish National Targeted Detection Programme identified 42 ZZ, 44 SZ, 14 SS, 430 MZ, 263 MS, 20 IX and 2 rare mutations. Analysis of 1,100 randomly selected individuals identified 113 MS, 46 MZ, 2 SS and 2 SZ genotypes. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that AATD in Ireland is more prevalent than previously estimated with Z and S allele frequencies among the highest in the world. Furthermore, our targeted detection programme enriched the population of those carrying the Z but not the S allele, suggesting the Z allele is more important in the pathogenesis of those conditions targeted by the detection programme."
11826019,"We report an epidemiological and genetic study attempting complete ascertainment of subjects with microphthalmia, anophthalmia, and coloboma (MAC) born in Scotland during a 16 year period beginning on 1 January 1981. A total of 198 cases were confirmed giving a minimum live birth prevalence of 19 per 100 000. One hundred and twenty-two MAC cases (61.6%) from 115 different families were clinically examined and detailed pregnancy, medical, and family histories obtained. A simple, rational, and apparently robust classification of the eye phenotype was developed based on the presence or absence of a defect in closure of the optic (choroidal) fissure. A total of 85/122 (69.7%) of cases had optic fissure closure defects (OFCD), 12/122 (9.8%) had non-OFCD, and 25/122 (20.5%) had defects that were unclassifiable owing to the severity of the corneal or anterior chamber abnormality. Segregation analysis assuming single and multiple incomplete ascertainment, respectively, returned a sib recurrence risk of 6% and 10% in the whole group and 8.1% and 13.3% in the OFCD subgroup. Significant recurrence risks were found in both unilateral and bilateral disease. In four families, one parent had an OFCD, two of which were new diagnoses in asymptomatic subjects. All recurrences in first degree relatives occurred in the OFCD group with a single first cousin recurrence seen in the non-OFCD group. A total of 84/122 of the MAC cases were screened for mutations in the coding regions of PAX6, CHX10, and SIX3. No pathogenic mutations were identified in the OFCD cases. A single PAX6 homeodomain missense mutation was identified in a subject with partial aniridia that had been initially misclassified as coloboma."
16595645,"AIM: To assess the Scottish newborn screening programme for congenital hypothyroidism from 1994 to 2003 (period 2) for performance and compare with an initial audit covering 1979 to 1993 (period 1). DESIGN: Performance data-age at blood spot sampling, notification by screening laboratory, start of treatment, and the prevalence of late testing, notification or treatment-were compared, together with the incidence of congenital hypothyroidism. RESULTS: Comparing data for period 2 with period 1, the mean annual incidence of true congenital hypothyroidism was 1:3655 live births v 1:4363. Median age for Guthrie sampling (all referrals) was 6 v 7 days (p<0.0001). Late sampling (>10 days) had fallen from 10.7% to 7%. For infants requiring repeat sampling before notification, the median (range) interval between initial and final repeat samples was 11 (1 to 52) compared with 14 (3 to 73) days. Median age at notification for true congenital hypothyroidism was 10 v 12 days (p <0.0001). Late notification (>15 days) was justifiable (mild TSH elevation) in 10 of 13 patients in period 2. Median age at start of treatment for true congenital hypothyroidism had improved to 11 days from 13.5 days. For true congenital hypothyroidism, late treatment (>16 days) occurred in 7% of patients compared with 19% (p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: There has been an improvement in performance measures for the congenital hypothyroidism screening programme in Scotland. However, late sampling, occurring primarily in inpatients and which is never justified, remains a problem, while the interval between initial and recall sampling is a further source of delay."
11701251,"The present study examined whether changes in the incidence of West syndrome (WS) could be used to evaluate changes in the quality of prenatal care over time. The incidence of WS in Finland did not change (1960-1991) in spite of increased survival of low-birth-weight infants. Small-for-gestational age (SGA) infants were more apt to develop infantile spasms than preterm average-for-gestational age infants. The number of SGA infants with neonatal hypoglycemia and infantile spasms decreased significantly. The number of cases of brain malformation and tuberous sclerosis increased; this probably reflects the development of more refined neuroradiological screening methods. Early prenatal factors seem to play a major role in the genesis of infantile spasms. Little can be done to reduce the incidence of WS, but every effort should be made to reduce the number of SGA infants by good prenatal care and treating neonatal hypoglycemia carefully."
15751925,"To evaluate the United Arab Emirate National Newborn Screening Programme we compared coverage, timeliness of programme indicators (age at sampling, recall and treatment initiation, timing of specimen delivery and laboratory results) and specimen quality with international standards. Recall rate, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values and relative incidence rates for phenylketonuria (PKU) and congenital hypothyroidism (CH) were calculated. Investigations for hypothyroidism included thyroid function studies (T3, T4, fT4 and TSH), technetium-99m thyroid scan when possible and thyroglobulin and thyroid antibodies when indicated. PKU investigations included plasma amino acids and measurement of biopterin defects. In the 6 years before December 2000, 138,718 neonates were screened. Relative incidences for CH and for classic PKU were 1:1570 and 1:20,050 respectively."
16897122,"Behcet's disease (BD) has a higher prevalence in countries along the ancient silk route, but the actual prevalence in Israel is unknown. We evaluated the occurrence and clinical expression of BD in the northern region of Israel: in the whole population and by ethnic groups. The sample included all adult patients with BD (International Study Group criteria) treated at three medical centers in northern Israel. Patient data were collected by file review and physician survey. Relevant demographic data for the population served by the medical centers were obtained from the official Israeli authorities. A total of 112 patients were identified. The overall prevalence of BD was 15.2/100,000 and was similar in men and women. The prevalence rates among the Jewish, Arab, and Druze populations were 8.6, 26.2, and 146.4 per 100,000, respectively. Age at disease onset was similar in all ethnic groups and significantly lower in males (28.6+/-9.7 vs 32.9+/-11.3, p=0.03). There were no differences in disease manifestations by sex or ethnicity. All Druze patients were HLA-B5 positive, compared to 80.8% of the Arab patients and 72.0% of the Jewish patients. Recurrent oral ulcers in family members were more common in Arab patients (p=0.004). The BD severity index was significantly lower in Druze patients (p=0.05), mainly in males (p=0.03). This study confirms the high prevalence of BD in Israel and the variability in disease rates and expression by ethnic origin. Our findings, particularly regarding the Druze population, call for further field surveys and genetic studies."
9489916,"BACKGROUND:The relative frequencies of the autoimmune liver diseases primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), and autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) have not been studied. We therefore performed an epidemiologic investigation to describe the incidence and prevalence of the three diseases in a defined population. METHODS:Patients with PBC, PSC, or AIH admitted to Aker University Hospital in Oslo were prospectively registered during the 10-year period 1986-95. This hospital serves a defined population of 130,000 inhabitants. The mean yearly incidence and the point prevalences at the end of each year were calculated. RESULTS:During the 10-year period 21 patients with PBC, 17 with PSC, and 25 with AIH were diagnosed. The mean annual incidence per 100,000 was 1.6 for PBC, 1.3 for PSC, and 1.9 for AIH. The point prevalences per 100,000 on 31 December 1995 were 14.6, 8.5, and 16.9 for PBC, PSC, and AIH, respectively. CONCLUSIONS:The prevalences of PBC and AIH are of the same order of magnitude and about twice as high as that of PSC. These epidemiologic data can be used to estimate the number of liver transplantations required due to autoimmune liver diseases."
31096746,"Toxoplasmosis is a serious zoonotic disease that can lead to abortion and congenital disorders and has a widespread global distribution in humans and animals. The objective of this review was to investigate the incidence of toxoplasmosis in Iranian neonates in order to obtain a comprehensive assessment of the overall situation of the disease for use in developing future interventions. Original studies investigating the incidence of Toxoplasma gondii infections in Iranian neonates were systematically searched in a number of English-language and Persian-language electronic databases. The search process resulted in the inclusion of a total of 11 studies in the systematic review, 10 of which were entered into the meta-analysis. The reviewed articles included 2,230 Iranian neonates investigated through January 1, 2018. Based on the retrieved studies, the overall weighted incidence rates of toxoplasmosis in the Iranian neonatal population and neonates with suspected congenital toxoplasmosis were estimated to be 0.64% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.31 to 1.09) and 4.10% (95% CI, 2.68 to 5.77), respectively, using a fixed-effects model. The findings of the reviewed studies demonstrate that the incidence of toxoplasmosis is high in Iranian neonates. Accordingly, it can be concluded that toxoplasmosis is a serious public health concern that has been ignored by the Ministry of Health. Therefore, it is essential to perform further studies, in addition to implementing screening and detection programs, using standardized methods to estimate the incidence of toxoplasmosis in Iran and to determine its associated risk factors."
7751574,"The Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare Research Committee on Aberrant Portal Blood Flow carried out an epidemiological survey and clinical study on Budd-Chiari syndrome in 1990. In the primary survey for determining the prevalence of the disease, a questionnaire was sent to all major hospitals throughout Japan and 160 cases seen in 1989 were compiled. More epidemiological details were obtained in 87 of these 160 cases. The number of patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome in this country was estimated to be about 300 (prevalence of 2.4/million) with about 20 new cases occurring every year. In the clinical study, 157 authentic cases of Budd-Chiari syndrome studied in 15 years (1975-89) were analyzed. There were 87 males (average age, 36.4 years) and 70 females (46.5 years), and the average period from the likely onset to the first medical consultation was 6.6 years, suggesting that these patients were mostly chronic cases. The main clinical features were hepatomegaly, leg edema, ascites and venous dilatation over the trunk. Abdominal pain was recorded in only four (2.5%). There were 16 (10.2%) with known identifiable etiologies. Of the patients 93% showed an obstructing lesion of various thickness in the hepatic portion of the inferior vena cava. Only nine (5.7%) had hepatic vein obstruction without caval lesions. Thus, the majority of Budd-Chiari syndrome patients in Japan are idiopathic, having an obstructing lesion in the inferior vena cava. The main causes of 33 deaths (21%) were liver failure, variceal bleeding and hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatocellular carcinoma occurred in 10 (6.4%) in the 15-year period. However, the incidence of Budd-Chiari syndrome among all cases of hepatocellular carcinoma was less than 1% in the survey made by the Liver Cancer Study Group of Japan."
15857333,"The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of congenital hypothyroidism (CH) in the West Black Sea Area, a mild-to-moderate iodine deficient area in Turkey. Neonatal screening for CH was performed using blood specimens collected onto filter paper. Thyrotropin [thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)] was measured by radioimmunoassay, and a value >20 microU/ml was considered as cut-off point for re-examining. Venous serum was obtained to measure TSH, thyroxin (T4), free T4 (FT4) and thyroglobulin (TG). To determine the iodine status of the study area, median urinary iodine was measured in 212 randomly selected neonates and their mothers. A total of 18606 neonates were screened from three cities (Bolu, Düzce, and Zonguldak) between 2000 and 2002. With a cut-off point of TSH value >20 microU/ml, the recall rate was found 1.6%. Eight cases of CH were diagnosed (incidence 1/2326). There were three cases of transient hypothyroidism, with an incidence of 1/6202. Twenty-six percent of the TSH values was greater than 5 microU/ml. Median urinary iodine concentrations in neonates and their mothers were 85 microg/l and 40 microg/l, respectively. The incidences of CH, transient hypothyroidism and the recall rate were higher in our study area than many countries in Europe. The study area has been affected by mild-to-moderate iodine deficiency. Neonatal screening for CH should be introduced in Turkey without delay. A national comprehensive infantile hypothyroidism and iodine prophylaxis policies should be developed."
16182667,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate cystic fibrosis (CF) birth rates in Canada from 1971 to 2000 and to assess the population impact of genetic testing in families with a history of CF, after identification of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator gene in 1989. STUDY DESIGN: Age-at-diagnosis data were obtained from the Canadian Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Data Registry and Canadian births for the corresponding years from Canadian Vital Statistics. Estimates of the CF birth rate in each year were based on a nonparametric model that allows the birth rate to vary across the years and adjusts for censoring of currently undiagnosed patients. RESULTS: The overall CF birth rate from 1971-1987 was 1/2714 with no increasing or decreasing trend. Beginning in 1988, 1 year before identification of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator gene, estimated CF birth rates followed a linear decline to an estimated rate of 1/3608 in 2000. CF birth rates may have stabilized in the last few years, but further decline may occur with implementation of carrier screening in the general population. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate the temporal association of genetic testing and declining CF birth rates in Canada. They may assist in decisions relating to the allocation of resources for prenatal and neonatal CF screening programs."
19569174,"The evolution of pleural cancers and malignant pleural mesothelioma incidence in France between 1980 and 2005 was analysed using data derived from the French network of cancer registries (FRANCIM) and the French National Mesothelioma Surveillance Program (PNSM). Mesothelioma proportions in pleural cancers were calculated by diagnosis year in the 1980-2000 period. Our results suggest that the incidences of pleural cancer and mesothelioma levelled off in French men since 2000 and continued to increase in French women. A decrease of the annual pleural cancer incidence average in men was noticed (-3.4% of annual rate of change) between 2000 and 2005. The proportion of pleural cancers that were mesothelioma was unchanged between 1980 and 2003 with an average of 86%. The age standardised incidence rate of pleural mesothelioma remained relatively stable between 1998 and 2005 with a slight falling trend. For women, the age standardised incidence rate of pleural cancers and mesothelioma increased during the period 1998-2005. Additionally, the proportion of pleural cancers that were mesothelioma increased during the same period of time. Finally, the increased trend observed in the incidence of pleural mesothelioma and cancers in women is credibly due to their under diagnosis in the 1980-1997 period. The comparison between the French incidence and the American and British ones shows that the decreasing trend in incidence of mesothelioma and pleural cancers in French men since 2000 is potentially associated with a lower amphibole consumption and by the implementation of safety regulations at work from 1977."
21609352,"OBJECTIVE:Untreated Cushing's syndrome (CS) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. However, recent operative series suggest low morbidity and mortality for CS, whereas population-based surveys report elevated mortality rates. We investigated the mortality and morbidity of CS in New Zealand. DESIGN:A nationwide retrospective survey of patients with CS between 1960 and 2005 managed at the four main endocrinology services. PATIENTS:A total of 253 patients with CS were identified, excluding adrenal carcinoma and malignant ectopic CS. MEASUREMENTS; The primary outcome was the standardized mortality ratio (SMR), comparing the observed number of deaths with the expected number for the population matched for age, sex and duration of follow-up. Secondary outcomes were the change in prevalence of co-morbidities at presentation and at final follow-up. RESULTS:The approximate prevalence and incidence of CS was 79/million and 1·8/million/y. The mean age at presentation was 39 year, and median duration of follow-up was 6·4 year (range 0-46). Overall, 89% achieved biochemical cure at last follow-up, with >90% achieving biochemical cure for CS from adrenal adenoma and pituitary causes. Thirty-six patients died during follow-up compared with 8·8 expected deaths (SMR 4·1, 95%CI 2·9-5·6). While hypertension, sexual dysfunction, myopathy and mild psychiatric illness were significantly reduced after treatment, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, moderate or major psychiatric illness, and osteoporosis were common at final follow-up. CONCLUSION:CS is associated with both high mortality and a high prevalence of co-morbidities, even when biochemical cure rates are between 80% and 90%."
1796818,"We conducted an epidemiological study of systemic sclerosis in the city of Tokyo using the records of patients who had been registered to receive free medical service for intractable diseases. A total of 636 patients were registered as having systemic sclerosis in 1987, and we sent questionnaires to the doctor of each patient. The contents of the questionnaires included the patient's name, sex, age, occupation, major symptoms, therapy and laboratory findings. We received 357 completed replies, and were able to analyse them. Our study estimated that at 1 January 1988 the prevalence rate in Japan was between 2.1 and 5.3 per 100,000. The male/female ratio was 14:1. The ages of the patients when surveyed ranged from 17 to 82 years, with a mean age of 51 years, peaking with the most numerous group being 50-59 years. The characteristic signs of systemic sclerosis were as follows: proximal scleroderma, 75%; sclerodactyly, 91%; pitting scars, 49%; short sublingual frenulum, 49%; pulmonary fibrosis, 45%; diffuse pigmentation, 45%; and phalangeal contracture, 35%. Raynaud's phenomenon was present in 93% of patients, and was the initial symptom in 59% of cases. With respect to specific antinuclear antibodies, anticentromere antibody was present in 19% and antitopoisomerase I antibody was present in 27%."
19192301,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease characterised by progressive muscular paralysis reflecting degeneration of motor neurones in the primary motor cortex, corticospinal tracts, brainstem and spinal cord. Incidence (average 1.89 per 100,000/year) and prevalence (average 5.2 per 100,000) are relatively uniform in Western countries, although foci of higher frequency occur in the Western Pacific. The mean age of onset for sporadic ALS is about 60 years. Overall, there is a slight male prevalence (M:F ratio approximately 1.5:1). Approximately two thirds of patients with typical ALS have a spinal form of the disease (limb onset) and present with symptoms related to focal muscle weakness and wasting, where the symptoms may start either distally or proximally in the upper and lower limbs. Gradually, spasticity may develop in the weakened atrophic limbs, affecting manual dexterity and gait. Patients with bulbar onset ALS usually present with dysarthria and dysphagia for solid or liquids, and limbs symptoms can develop almost simultaneously with bulbar symptoms, and in the vast majority of cases will occur within 1-2 years. Paralysis is progressive and leads to death due to respiratory failure within 2-3 years for bulbar onset cases and 3-5 years for limb onset ALS cases. Most ALS cases are sporadic but 5-10% of cases are familial, and of these 20% have a mutation of the SOD1 gene and about 2-5% have mutations of the TARDBP (TDP-43) gene. Two percent of apparently sporadic patients have SOD1 mutations, and TARDBP mutations also occur in sporadic cases. The diagnosis is based on clinical history, examination, electromyography, and exclusion of 'ALS-mimics' (e.g. cervical spondylotic myelopathies, multifocal motor neuropathy, Kennedy's disease) by appropriate investigations. The pathological hallmarks comprise loss of motor neurones with intraneuronal ubiquitin-immunoreactive inclusions in upper motor neurones and TDP-43 immunoreactive inclusions in degenerating lower motor neurones. Signs of upper motor neurone and lower motor neurone damage not explained by any other disease process are suggestive of ALS. The management of ALS is supportive, palliative, and multidisciplinary. Non-invasive ventilation prolongs survival and improves quality of life. Riluzole is the only drug that has been shown to extend survival."
28968809,"The aim was to review the worldwide incidence and prevalence of SLE and variation with age, sex, ethnicity and time.A systematic search of MEDLINE and EMBASE search engines was carried out using Medical Subject Headings and keyword search terms for Systemic Lupus Erythematosus combined with incidence, prevalence and epidemiology in August 2013 and updated in September 2016. Author, journal, year of publication, country, region, case-finding method, study period, number of incident or prevalent cases, incidence (per 100 000 person-years) or prevalence (per 100 000 persons) and age, sex or ethnic group-specific incidence or prevalence were collected.The highest estimates of incidence and prevalence of SLE were in North America [23.2/100 000 person-years (95% CI: 23.4, 24.0) and 241/100 000 people (95% CI: 130, 352), respectively]. The lowest incidences of SLE were reported in Africa and Ukraine (0.3/100 000 person-years), and the lowest prevalence was in Northern Australia (0 cases in a sample of 847 people). Women were more frequently affected than men for every age and ethnic group. Incidence peaked in middle adulthood and occurred later for men. People of Black ethnicity had the highest incidence and prevalence of SLE, whereas those with White ethnicity had the lowest incidence and prevalence. There appeared to be an increasing trend of SLE prevalence with time.There are worldwide differences in the incidence and prevalence of SLE that vary with sex, age, ethnicity and time. Further study of genetic and environmental risk factors may explain the reasons for these differences. More epidemiological studies in Africa are warranted."
22963642,"BACKGROUND: Recent literature has shown increasing incidence and prevalence rates of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). However, data are mainly based on small studies and come from centers dedicated to EoE. Aim of this study was to estimate the incidence rates of EoE by using a large database. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study of the pathology reports describing esophageal eosinophilia from 1996 through 2010, using the nationwide network and registry of histo- and cytopathology in The Netherlands (PALGA). All histopathology reports nationwide enter this database. We classified cases according to the diagnosis made by the pathologist. Annual incidence rates of EoE were estimated. KEY RESULTS: Our search criteria yielded 8838 positive pathology reports. Eosinophilic esophagitis was diagnosed in 674 patients, of which 74% were men. In another 174 patients, no distinction was made between eosinophilia caused by gastro-esophageal reflux disease or EoE. The incidence of EoE increased considerably over the years, being 0.01 in 1996, 0.01 in 2000, 0.14 in 2005, and 1.31 per 100,000 persons in 2010. Eosinophilic esophagitis was diagnosed in all age groups, but in 2010 the highest incidence was seen in 20-29 years old males, in whom it was estimated to be 3.23 per 100,000 persons. The incidence in children was 0.73 per 100,000 in 2010. No seasonal variation in diagnosis of EoE was observed. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: In this large study, we found robust data on increasing incidence rates of pediatric and adult EoE in the past 15 years. This rapidly increasing incidence has not reached a plateau yet."
20082463,"Autosomal dominantly inherited tumor-prone syndromes are a substantial health problem and are amenable to epidemiologic studies by combining cancer surveillance registries with a genetic register (GR)-based approach. Knowledge of the frequency of the conditions provides a basis for appropriate health-resources allocations. GRs for five tumor-prone syndromes were established in the Manchester region of North West England in 1989 and 1990. Mapping birth dates of affected individuals from families onto regional birth rates has allowed an estimate of birth incidence, disease prevalence, and de novo mutation rates. Disease prevalence in order of frequency were for neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1): 1 in 4,560; familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP): 1 in 18,976; nevoid basal cell carcinoma [Gorlin syndrome (GS)]: 1 in 30,827; neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) 1 in 56,161; and von Hippel Lindau (VHL) 1 in 91,111. Best estimates for birth incidence were: 1 in 2,699; 1 in 8,619; 1 in 14,963, 1 in 33,000; and 1 in 42,987, respectively. The proportions due to de novo mutation were: 42% (NF1); 16% (FAP); 26% (GS); 56% (NF2); and 21% (VHL). Estimates for NF1, NF2, FAP, and VHL are in line with previous estimates, and we provide the first estimates of birth incidence and de novo mutation rate for GS."
23628737,"In Susac syndrome, occlusions of microvessels--presumed to be mediated by an autoimmune response to an as yet unknown antigen--lead to a characteristic clinical triad of CNS dysfunction, branch retinal artery occlusions, and sensorineural hearing impairment. Susac syndrome is considered a rare but important differential diagnosis in numerous neurological, psychiatric, ophthalmological, and ear, nose and throat disorders. Improved understanding of this disorder is crucial, therefore, to ensure that patients receive appropriate treatment and care. Current knowledge on Susac syndrome is largely based on reports of single patients, small case series, and nonsystematic reviews. The aim of this Review is to extend these previous, primarily anecdotal findings by compiling data from all 304 cases of Susac syndrome that have been published worldwide, which were identified following a literature search with predefined search, inclusion and exclusion criteria. From this data, we present an overview of demographic, clinical and diagnostic data on Susac syndrome, providing a reliable basis for our current understanding of this rare disease. Where possible, we make recommendations for clinical diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and management of patients with suspected Susac syndrome."
29284005,"Strongyloides stercoralis is a parasite that causes strongyloidiasis, a neglected tropical disease. S. stercoralis is a soil-transmitted helminth that is widely distributed in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Strongyloidiasis can occur without any symptoms or as a chronic infection characterized by mild, unspecific symptoms such as pruritus, abdominal pain or discomfort; respiratory impairment also may manifest as a potentially fatal hyperinfection or disseminated infection. Most studies on strongyloidiasis in Spain have been related to chronic forms in immigrants or travellers from endemic zones and have mainly analysed out-patient populations. Studies of the impact of strongyloidiasis cases admitted to hospitals in Spain are lacking. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyse the impact of strongyloidiasis in hospital care in Spain.We designed a retrospective descriptive study using the Minimum Basic Data Set (MBDS, CMBD in Spanish) for inpatients with ICD-9: 127.2 (strongyloidiasis) diagnoses admitted to hospitals in the Spanish National Health System between 1998 and 2014.A total of 507 hospitalizations with diagnosis of strongyloidiasis were recorded, 324 cases (63.9%) were males. The mean (±SD) age was 42.1±20.1 years. The impact of strongyloidiasis on the total population of Spain was 0.06 cases per 105 person-years, and the infection burden increased progressively over time (from 0.01 cases per 105 person-years in 1999 to 0.10 cases per 105 person-years in 2014). 40 cases (7.9%) died. The total cost was approximately €8,681,062.3, and the mean cost per patient was €17,122.4±97,968.8.Our data suggest that strongyloidiasis is frequent in Spain and is increasing in incidence. Therefore, it would be desirable to improve the oversight and surveillance of this condition. Due to the fact that strongyloidiasis can be fatal, we believe that there is a need to establish risk categories for inclusion in national guidelines/protocols for screening individuals at risk of developing strongyloidiasis."
23660944,"Ependymomas are rare primary gliomas that commonly affect both children and adults, but unique as survival is worse in children.Data on brain and central nervous system primary malignant and non-malignant ependymal tumours from the Central Brain Tumor Registry of the United States analytic data set and primary malignant ependymal tumours from the SEER 13 registries research data file were used to evaluate incidence and survival, respectively.The 2004-2009 average annual age-adjusted incidence rate of ependymal tumours was 0.41/100,000. Spinal cord/cauda equina was the primary site at diagnosis for 50-60% of ependymal tumours in adult age groups in contrast to about 20% in children and adolescents. Ependymoma was the most frequent histology in all age groups; however, anaplastic ependymoma comprised about 30% in cases 0-19 years of age compared with about 3-5% in adult age groups. Overall, relative survival was favourable with rates at ∼85% and 75% at 3 and 10 years post diagnosis, respectively. However, children and adolescents, the oldest adult age group, cases diagnosed with anaplastic ependymoma and/or tumour location in a brain site had lowest survival rates.Paediatric cases had worse outcomes compared with adults for numerous reasons including having a higher percentage of anaplastic ependymomas and greater percentage of cases of intracranial disease."
9613728,"The prevalence of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) in an area of Northwestern Italy (Socio-Sanitary District of Cossato, 61,830 inhabitants) was analyzed and the reliability of ""drug tracer methodology"" evaluated. The patients were identified by both conventional epidemiological methodology (general practitioners, consultant neurologist, computerized archives) and drug tracer methodology (registered levodopa prescriptions). The diagnosis of PD was clinically verified by examining all patients. Of 146 patients examined, 104 were affected by PD; the remaining by other types of parkinsonism. The crude point prevalence rate (October 20, 1991) was 168 per 100,000 population (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 138-204), with a progressive increase up to the 80-89 age group. Using ""tracer"" methodology, the estimated crude point prevalence rate was 196 (95% CI 163-235), with an overestimation of the prevalence in older patients and women and an underestimation in younger and less seriously affected cases. The uneven distribution of PD in Italy appears to be the result of, at least in part, methodological factors. ""Tracer"" methodology may cause biases in the evaluation of the epidemiological characteristics of PD, especially if the clinical diagnosis of cases identified by this method is not carefully verified. Nevertheless, it appears useful as an additional source of cases for descriptive surveys."
17986328,"Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a rare, autoimmune neuromuscular junction disorder. Contemporary prevalence rates approach 1/5,000. MG presents with painless, fluctuating, fatigable weakness involving specific muscle groups. Ocular weakness with asymmetric ptosis and binocular diplopia is the most typical initial presentation, while early or isolated oropharyngeal or limb weakness is less common. The course is variable, and most patients with initial ocular weakness develop bulbar or limb weakness within three years of initial symptom onset. MG results from antibody-mediated, T cell-dependent immunologic attack on the endplate region of the postsynaptic membrane. In patients with fatigable muscle weakness, the diagnosis of MG is supported by: 1. pharmacologic testing with edrophonium chloride that elicits unequivocal improvement in strength; 2. electrophysiologic testing with repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) studies and/or single-fiber electromyography (SFEMG) that demonstrates a primary postsynaptic neuromuscular junctional disorder; and 3. serologic demonstration of acetylcholine receptor (AChR) or muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) antibodies. Differential diagnosis includes congenital myasthenic syndromes, Lambert Eaton syndrome, botulism, organophosphate intoxication, mitochondrial disorders involving progressive external ophthalmoplegia, acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (AIDP), motor neuron disease, and brainstem ischemia. Treatment must be individualized, and may include symptomatic treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors and immune modulation with corticosteroids, azathioprine, cyclosporine, and mycophenolate mofetil. Rapid, temporary improvement may be achieved for myasthenic crises and exacerbations with plasma exchange (PEX) or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg). Owing to improved diagnostic testing, immunotherapy, and intensive care, the contemporary prognosis is favorable with less than five percent mortality and nearly normal life expectancy."
22288591,"In order to build a common data pool and estimate the disease burden of primary immunodeficiencies (PID) in Europe, the European Society for Immunodeficiencies (ESID) has developed an internet-based database for clinical and research data on patients with PID. This database is a platform for epidemiological analyses as well as the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies and the identification of novel disease-associated genes. Since its start in 2004, 13,708 patients from 41 countries have been documented in the ESID database. Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) represents the most common entity with 2880 patients or 21% of all entries, followed by selective immunoglobulin A (sIgA) deficiency (1424 patients, 10·4%). The total documented prevalence of PID is highest in France, with five patients per 100,000 inhabitants. The highest documented prevalence for a single disease is 1·3 per 100,000 inhabitants for sIgA deficiency in Hungary. The highest reported incidence of PID per 100,000 live births was 16·2 for the period 1999-2002 in France. The highest reported incidence rate for a single disease was 6·7 for sIgA deficiency in Spain for the period 1999-2002. The genetic cause was known in 36·2% of all registered patients. Consanguinity was reported in 8·8%, and 18·5% of patients were reported to be familial cases; 27·9% of patients were diagnosed after the age of 16. We did not observe a significant decrease in the diagnostic delay for most diseases between 1987 and 2010. The most frequently reported long-term medication is immunoglobulin replacement."
16844727,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and sarcoidosis are common diagnoses in patients attending chest clinics, but little is known about the epidemiology of these diseases. We used data from a general practice database to provide information on the current incidence of IPF and sarcoidosis in the UK.Data were extracted for all patients with a diagnosis of IPF or sarcoidosis between 1991 and 2003. The whole population of the database was used to calculate disease incidence stratified by age, sex, region, and time period. Poisson regression was used to compare the incidence between populations and Cox regression was used to compare survival between populations.920 cases of IPF (mean age 71 years, 62% male) and 1019 cases of sarcoidosis (mean age 47 years, 47% male) were identified. The overall incidence rate per 100 000 person-years was 4.6 for IPF and 5.0 for sarcoidosis. The incidence of IPF increased progressively between 1991 and 2003 (p<0.00001), and was highest in Northern England and Scotland (p<0.0001). The survival of patients with IPF was stable over time. In contrast, the incidence of sarcoidosis was highest in London, West Midlands and Northern Ireland and remained stable over time.The incidence of IPF has more than doubled between 1990 and 2003; this is not due to the ageing of the UK population or an increased ascertainment of milder cases. The incidence of sarcoidosis has not changed during this time period. Our findings suggest that more than 4000 new cases of IPF and 3000 new cases of sarcoidosis are currently diagnosed each year in the UK."
24932888,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the epidemiology of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) over a 15-year period in a defined area of northern Italy. METHODS: All patients with incident GPA diagnosed from January 1, 1995 to December 31, 2009 living in the Reggio Emilia area were identified by looking at computerized hospital discharge diagnoses, by contacting Reggio Emilia Hospital physicians and community-based specialists, and by checking the databases of the pathology and the laboratory departments and the Reggio Emilia district database for rare diseases. Patients were classified according to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) algorithm. Patients were followed up from the time of diagnosis until either their death or December 31, 2011. For each case, we identified 20 control subjects from the same geographic area matched for age and gender. RESULTS: A total of 18 patients (7 men and 11 women) with GPA were identified. The overall age- and sex-adjusted incidence rate (IR) was 2.4 per million (95% CI: 1.2-3.5). The mean annual IR increased from 1.7/million/year during 1995-1999 to 3.4 during 2005-2009. The highest IR occurred in females aged 70-79 years (13.5 per million; 95% CI: 5.0-30.0) and in males aged ≥ 80 years (14.9 per million; 95% CI: 2.5-49.4). The prevalence of GPA on December 31, 2009 was 34.3 per million (95% CI: 20.3-54.2). The point prevalence per million increased from 17.8 (95% CI: 7.7-35.1) in 1999 to 34.3 (95% CI: 20.3-54.2) in 2009. Survival among individuals with GPA was significantly reduced compared to that observed in the matched control population (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: In the Italian population, GPA is very uncommon and GPA patients have reduced survival."
18412274,"One hundred sixty-four patients with Down syndrome (DS) were confirmed in Tottori Prefecture, Japan, from 1980 to 1999. The sex ratio of 1.52 (99 males and 65 females) was comparable to that reported in previous studies. The live birth prevalence per 1,000 was 1.52 (95% CI: 1.29-1.75) from 1980 to 1999, with a prevalence of 1.34 (95% CI: 1.05-1.63) recorded between 1980 and 1989, and 1.74 (95% CI: 1.37-2.11) between 1990 and 1999. There was no statistically significant change between these two decades (chi(2)-test). Live birth prevalence in these two decades showed a significant increase (chi(2)-test, P < 0.005) compared with that recorded in 1969-1978 in Tottori Prefecture (0.803, 95% CI: 0.677-0.929). Mean ages of mothers at the birth of a DS patient were 31.0 years in 1980-1989 and 32.4 years in 1990-1999 (t-test, no significant difference). Dispersion analysis on the mean age of mothers at birth for patients born between 1969-1978, 1980-1989, and 1990-1999 showed a significant difference (t-test, P < 0.005), while comparing the mean age of mothers in 1969-1978 to those in 1990-1999 also revealed a significant difference (t-test, P < 0.001). Live birth prevalence has increased due to the rise in fertility rates among older women, although maternal age-specific risk rates remain unchanged. The widespread introduction of induced abortion following prenatal diagnosis decreased live birth prevalence of DS largely in European (and a few Asian) countries after 1990, or kept prevalence steady, despite increasing fertility rates among women aged 30 and over. In contrast, all published studies have reported an increase in live birth prevalence of this syndrome in Japan, probably resulting from the fact that prenatal diagnoses are used only exceptionally in this country (due to the negative attitude toward selection of life in Japanese culture)."
20066507,"Epidemiologic studies of autoimmune diseases have not considered them in the aggregate. The objective was to estimate the prevalence of 30 autoimmune diseases separately and in aggregate according to ICD-10 classification. The lifetime prevalence of the entire population of 5,506,574 persons alive in Denmark on October 31, 2006, was estimated by linking records of all visitors to hospitals and specialty clinics via National Patient Registers from January 1, 1977 through October 31, 2006. The prevalences vary from 0.06/1,000 for Pemphigus to 8.94/1,000 for Type 1 diabetes. Nearly 4% of the population had one or more autoimmune disease. The general conclusion is that autoimmune diseases as an aggregate are common."
18204109,"Organising pneumonia (OP) is a relatively rare interstitial lung disease. It s definition is based on a characteristic histological pattern in the presence of certain clinical and radiological features. Organising pneumonia represents also what has been called Bronchiolitis Obliterans Organising Pneumonia (BOOP). Recently it has been recommended to call OP cryptogenic organising pneumonia (COP) when no definite cause or characteristic clinical context is found and secondary organising pneumonia (SOP) when causes can be identified such as infection or it occurs in a characteristic clinical context such as connective tissue disorder. The most common clinical symptoms are dyspnea, cough, fever and general malaise. It is common that symptoms have been present for some weeks before the diagnosis is made. Patients commonly have lowered PO2 and a mildly restrictive spirometry. Radiographic features are most often patchy bilateral airspace opacities but an interstitial pattern or focal opacities can also be seen. Most of patients respond well to steroids but relapses are quite common. The aim of this paper is to present an overview of the disease and the main results from studies on OP in Iceland. The mean annual incidence for OP in Iceland was 1.97/100,000 inhabitants. Annual incidence for COP was 1.10/100,000 and 0.87/100,000 for SOP. This is higher than in most other studies. In Iceland patients with OP had a higher standardized mortality ratio than the general population despite good clinical responses. No clinical symptoms could separate between SOP and COP."
7668318,"To establish the incidence of neuronal ceroid-lipofuscinoses (NCL) in Italy, we sent a questionnaire to all Neuropediatric and Child Neuropsychiatric Departments (answer rate 15/34 = 44%). Diagnoses were accepted only when based on firm clinical and/or electron microscopic criteria. We collected 58 cases born between 1966-1991 (2 infantile NCL, 37 late infantile NCL, and 19 juvenile NCL). The incidence was calculated only on patients born between 1974-1984. In this period, the incidence of overall NCL in the Italian population was calculated to be 0.56 per 100,000 live births (0.36 for late infantile NCL, and 0.20 for juvenile NCL). Our data show that infantile NCL is very rare in Italy, and that late infantile seems to be the most frequent form of NCL."
20566927,"OBJECTIVE: To present epidemiologic and clinical data from the Australasian Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB) Registry, the first orphan disease registry in Australia. DESIGN: Observational study (cross-sectional and longitudinal). SETTING: Australian private dermatology practice, inpatient ward, and outpatient clinic. PATIENTS: Systematic case finding of patients with EB simplex, junctional EB (JEB), and dystrophic EB and data collection were performed throughout Australia and New Zealand from January 1, 2006, through December 31, 2008. Patients were consecutively enrolled in the study after clinical assessment and laboratory diagnosis. Medical records were retrospectively examined, and physicians involved in EB care were contacted to obtain patient history. A Herlitz JEB case series was prepared from registry data. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Demographics and prognosis of patients with Herlitz JEB. RESULTS: A total of 259 patients were enrolled in the study: 139 with EBS, 91 with dystrophic EB, 28 with JEB, and 1 with Kindler syndrome. Most enrollees were Australian citizens (n = 243), with an Australian prevalence rate of 10.3 cases per million. The age range in the registry was birth to 99 years, with a mean and median age of 24.1 and 18.0 years, respectively. Ages were similar in patients with EBS and dominant dystrophic EB but were markedly lower in patients with JEB. Patients with Herlitz JEB (n = 10) had the highest morbidity and mortality rates, with a mean age at death of 6.8 months. Sepsis, failure to thrive, and tracheolaryngeal complications were the leading causes of death. CONCLUSIONS: The Australasian EB registry is the first registry in Australia and New Zealand to provide original data on age, sex, ethnicity, and geographical and disease subtype distribution. The Australasian Herlitz JEB cohort witnessed a high infant mortality rate and poor prognosis overall."
23291568,"BACKGROUND:The incidence of congenital hypothyroidism (CH) has been increasing in Western countries, and some populations, including Asians, have a higher incidence. Delayed diagnosis and early treatment influence the outcome of CH. We investigated the incidence and clinical characteristics of CH in Taiwan. METHODS:In this retrospective database study we identified cases of CH diagnosed during 1997-2008 in the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD). Patients who had a Serious Accidents and Diseases certificate were included in the incidence calculation. We focused on CH patients who were born during 1997-2003 and determined their age at diagnosis and CH-related clinical features. Mental retardation and physiological delays were evaluated with respect to age at diagnosis. RESULTS:A total of 1482 cases were identified. Incidence during the 12-year period was 5.02 per 10 000 births. Among 1115 patients, the most common clinical features of CH were developmental delay (9.6%), constipation (11.6%), and delayed physiological development (9.1%). Congenital anomalies of the heart (7.7%), epilepsy (2.7%), and infantile cerebral palsy (3.2%) were also noted. Survival analysis showed that the risks of mental retardation (hazard ratio [HR], 3.180) and delayed physiological development (HR, 1.908) were greater when age at diagnosis was greater than 1 year. CONCLUSIONS:CH incidence was higher in Taiwan than in Western countries. Early diagnosis may decrease the risk of mental and physiological delay."
26946215,"To characterize the epidemiology of mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) from 1983 to 2014.An inception cohort of patients with incident MCTD in 1985-2014 in Olmsted County, Minnesota was identified based on comprehensive individual medical record review. Diagnosis of MCTD required fulfillment of at least 1 of the 4 widely accepted diagnostic criteria without fulfillment of classification criteria for other connective tissue diseases. Data were collected on demographic characteristics, clinical presentation, laboratory investigations, and mortality.A total of 50 incident cases of MCTD were identified (mean age 48.1 years and 84% were female). The annual incidence of MCTD was 1.9 per 100,000 population. Raynaud's phenomenon was the most common initial symptoms (50%), followed by arthralgia (30%) and swollen hands (16%). The diagnosis was frequently delayed with the median time from first symptom to fulfillment of criteria of 3.6 years. At fulfillment of criteria, arthralgia was the most prevalent manifestation (86%), followed by Raynaud's phenomenon (80%), swollen hands (64%), leukopenia/lymphopenia (44%), and heartburn (38%). Evolution to other connective tissue occurred infrequently with a 10-year rate of evolution of 8.5% and 6.3% for systemic lupus erythematosus and systemic sclerosis, respectively. The overall mortality was not different from the general population with a standardized mortality ratio of 1.1 (95% confidence interval 0.4-2.6).This study was the first population-based study of MCTD to provide a complete picture of epidemiology and clinical characteristics of MCTD. MCTD occurred in about 2 persons per 100,000 per year. Evolution to other connective diseases occurred infrequently and the mortality was not affected."
20878909,"BACKGROUND: The National Birth Defects Prevention Network collects state-specific birth defects surveillance data for annual publication of prevalence estimates and collaborative research projects. In 2006, data for 21 birth defects from 1999 through 2001 were presented as national birth prevalence estimates. The purpose of this report was to update these estimates using data from 2004 through 2006. METHODS: Population-based data from 11 active case-finding programs, 6 passive case-finding programs with case confirmation, and 7 passive programs without case confirmation were used in this analysis. Pooled birth prevalence estimates for 21 birth defects, stratified by case ascertainment approach, were calculated. National prevalence estimates, adjusted for maternal race/ethnicity and maternal age (trisomy 13, trisomy 18, and Down syndrome only) were determined using data from 14 programs. The impact of pregnancy outcomes on prevalence estimates was also assessed for five specific defects. RESULTS: National birth defects prevalence estimates ranged from 0.72 per 10,000 live births for common truncus to 14.47 per 10,000 live births for Down syndrome. Stratification by type of surveillance system showed that active programs had a higher prevalence of anencephaly, anophthalmia/microphthalmia, cleft lip with or without cleft palate, reduction defect of upper limbs, and trisomy 18. The birth prevalence of anencephaly, trisomy 13, and trisomy 18 also varied substantially with inclusion of elective terminations. CONCLUSION: Accurate and timely national estimates of the prevalence of birth defects are needed for monitoring trends, assessing prevention efforts, determining service planning, and understanding the burden of disease due to birth defects in the United States."
27793344,"Solar urticaria is a chronic inducible urticaria also classified as an idiopathic dermatosis. The objective of this paper is to define the phenotypic characteristics of solar urticaria and to evaluate its incidence.This was a retrospective multicenter study in which data were gathered on the epidemiology and clinical, photobiologic, laboratory, and therapeutic characteristics of solar urticaria.A total of 224 patients (141 women and 83 men) were included from 9 photobiology units. The mean age of the patients was 37.9 years (range, 3-73 years). A history of atopy was detected in 26.7%, and the most common presentation was allergic rhinitis (16.5%). Clinical signs were limited to sun-exposed areas in 75.9% of patients. The light spectrum most commonly implicated was visible light only (31.7%), and in 21% of cases it was only possible to trigger solar urticaria with natural light. The treatments most widely used by photobiology experts were oral antihistamines (65.46%), followed by different forms of phototherapy (34%). Complete resolution was observed most often in patients with solar urticaria triggered exclusively by visible or natural light, with statistically significant differences with respect to other wavelengths (P<.05). No increase in the annual incidence of solar urticaria was observed.We have presented the largest series of solar urticaria published to date. The epidemiological, clinical, and photobiologic findings confirm previously reported data, although there was a particularly high rate of negative phototests in our series. Reactivity exclusively to visible or natural light was associated with a higher probability of resolution. No increasing trend was observed in the annual incidence."
8784357,"OBJECTIVE: Comparative study of the incidence of classic 21-hydroxylase deficiency congenital adrenal hyperplasia (21ase-def CAH) and clinical findings of affected infants diagnosed via newborn screening versus case survey only in the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy. METHODS: Neonatal mass screening (from March 1980 to September 1983-Period A, and from March 1991 to August 1995-Period C) and case survey study (from 1980 to June 1995; case survey alone from October 1983 to February 1991--Period B) were performed by the Regional Referral Center for Neonatal Screening for Endocrine-Metabolic Disease with a laboratory (Central Laboratory, S. Orsola Hospital, Bologna) and clinical (First Pediatric Clinic, University of Bologna, S. Orsola Hospital, Bologna) component. A population-based sample of 420 960 newborns consecutively born in the Emilia-Romagna region from March 1980 to August 1995 were studied. Spot 17-OH-progesterone (nmol/L blood) was tested by the radioimmunoassay method after sample extraction during Period A and by fluoroimmunometric time resolved method without sample extraction during Period C. Serum 17-OH-progesterone (ng/dL or nmol/L) was tested by the radioimmunoassay method (Diagnostic Product Corporation Kit, Los Angeles, CA). The case survey was performed by means of a questionnaire sent to all regional centers dealing with pediatrics, neonatology, endocrinology, and pediatric surgery. RESULTS: Thirteen classic 21ase-def CAH were diagnosed by means of neonatal screening (combined A and C periods). One true and one questionable false-negative cases were identified. The incidence of classical 21-hydroxylase deficiency for the white population was 1:15 518 (95% confidence limits 1:9249-1:28 400) by neonatal screening plus case survey, 1:18 105 (95% confidence limits 1:10 365-1:35 041) by neonatal screening alone and 1:25 462 (95% confidence limits 1:12 925-1:59 043) by case survey alone. The sensitivity and specificity of screening for classic CAH were 83% and 99.8% for Period A and 90% and 99.2% for Period C, respectively. The percentage of salt-wasting forms and the male/female ratio were higher during the neonatal screening period than during the case survey only. Sixty-one percent of classic CAH patients benefited from a prompt diagnosis. Nonclassical 21ase-def CAH cases detected via screening and case survey were also reported. CONCLUSIONS: Even in a region with adequate neonatal services, clinical diagnosis alone of classic CAH might be delayed or misinterpreted and salt-wasting crises could cause neonatal deaths. CAH screening is thus an effective tool for diagnosing affected male infants without a family history of CAH and for preventing salt loss. However, to achieve maximal benefit from screening, quick procedures are necessary for notification of positive results and beginning prompt treatment. The possibility of false-negative cases indicates that clinical observation should never be abandoned, even with ongoing screening programs."
16318620,"Status and school achievement of 129 children born in Hessen between 1988 and 1992 and notified by a repeatedly elevated concentration of TSH in neonatal screening were evaluated. Interviews of mothers, teachers and pediatricians were used to score the development and educational achievements, respectively. A total of 298,175 newborns were screened and the incidence of permanent congenital hypothyroidism (PCH) was 1: 3,313 (n = 90). The female/male ratio was 1.37:1. In the 69 PCH cases with complete data, athyreosis (52%), hypoplasia (32%), dyshormogenesis (9%) and ectopia (7%) were identified as etiologies. The mean age at start of therapy decreases from day 15 in 1988 to day 9 in 1992; however, 27% of PCH children showed reduced psychomotor development as scored by their pediatrician and 11% attended a special school for educationally subnormal children. Approximately 25% of the children had lower educational achievements irrespective of the school type. Our finding of a relatively high percentage of PCH children with subnormal development points to a failure in disease management. A follow-up program including repeated serum TSH monitoring and yearly examinations by pediatric endocrinologists and supervision by the regional screening center is necessary to ensure the long-term efficacy of neonatal screening for congenital hypothyroidism."
8897214,"Using data from a French, the Swedish, and the California registries of congenital anomalies based on a total of more than 5 million births, the presence of nonfacial malformations in infants with cleft lip or cleft palate was studied. Cleft lip was less often associated with chromosome anomalies than cleft lip with cleft palate, but when all cleft lip/palate infants were compared with all infants with median cleft palate, chromosome anomalies were equally common. Ascertainment of chromosome anomalies in infants with facial clefts varied among programs. One hundred and twenty-one infants with non-chromosomal syndromes were identified-also, for these a marked variability between programs existed. An analysis of the type of associated malformations was made, comparing cleft lip/palate and median cleft palate infants. Some associations specific for the cleft types were described but to a large extent similar associations were found irrespective of cleft type. This may indicate that under certain circumstance, the various cleft types may have similar causes."
17633081,"We performed a retrospective epidemiological study of West syndrome (WS) in Miyagi prefecture over a 3-year period (2000 -2003). Twenty-two children (6 boys, 16 girls) developed WS. The incidence of WS was 3.4/10,000 live births. It agreed with the incidence of previous report in Japan. The mean age at onset of spasms was 6.5 months (range 1 - 17 months). Thirteen patients (59%) had symptomatic WS; of these, eight patients had prenatal causes and five had perinatal causes. There were no familial cases, although four patients had family history that included neurological diseases. Periventricular leukomalacia was found in four of nine patients with abnormal magnetic resonance imagings (MRI) . Early seizure outcome was good in twenty-one patients (95%). Six patients (29%) had seizure recurrence. There were no significant differences between symptomatic WS and cryptogenic WS in terms of seizure recurrence and persistent EEG abnormalities. The Five patients (20%) with developmental quotients (DQ) more than 70 were all cryptogenic WS, while patients with DQ less than 70 were significantly frequent in symptomatic WS as compared with cryptogenic WS."
16397865,"Gallbladder cancer is a relatively rare neoplasm that shows, however, high incidence rates in certain world populations. The interplay of genetic susceptibility, lifestyle factors and infections in gallbladder carcinogenesis is still poorly understood. Age-adjusted rates were calculated by cancer registry-based data. Epidemiological studies on gallbladder cancer were selected through searches of literature, and relative risks were abstracted for major risk factors. The highest gallbladder cancer incidence rates worldwide were reported for women in Delhi, India (21.5/100,000), South Karachi, Pakistan (13.8/100,000) and Quito, Ecuador (12.9/100,000). High incidence was found in Korea and Japan and some central and eastern European countries. Female-to-male incidence ratios were generally around 3, but ranged from 1 in Far East Asia to over 5 in Spain and Colombia. History of gallstones was the strongest risk factor for gallbladder cancer, with a pooled relative risk (RR) of 4.9 [95% confidence interval (CI): 3.3-7.4]. Consistent associations were also present with obesity, multiparity and chronic infections like Salmonella typhi and S. paratyphi [pooled RR 4.8 (95% CI: 1.4-17.3)] and Helicobacter bilis and H. pylori [pooled RR 4.3 (95% CI: 2.1-8.8)]. Differences in incidence ratios point to variations in gallbladder cancer aetiology in different populations. Diagnosis of gallstones and removal of gallbladder currently represent the keystone to gallbladder cancer prevention, but interventions able to prevent obesity, cholecystitis and gallstone formation should be assessed."
17893253,"To constitute a registry on acromegaly, AcroBel, to evaluate the epidemiology and quality of care of acromegaly in Belgium and Luxembourg.A nationwide survey from June 2003 till September 2004 aiming to collect data from all patients with acromegaly who had visited the participating endocrine clinics after 1 January 2000.Retrospective data collection coupled to a visit within the survey period, allowing sampling of metabolic parameters and centralised determination of GH and IGF-I.Four hundred and eighteen patients (51% men) were included, of which 96 were new cases, giving a mean incidence of 1.9 cases per million (c.p.m.) per year. The global prevalence was 41 c.p.m. but varied between 21 and 61 among different areas. Twenty-eight deaths were reported at a median age of 68 years in men and 74 years in women. The standardised mortality rate was significantly increased only in irradiated patients (2.70; confidence interval 1.60-4.55). Central measurements were available in 316 (75%) patients. Mean GH was < or = 2 microg/l in 65% and IGF-I was normal for age in 56%, while both criteria were fulfilled in 49%. Multimodal treatment was more effective than primary medical therapy, since 56.5% were controlled versus 24.3% (P < 0.0001).AcroBel provides an excellent tool to analyse the prevalence, incidence, treatment modalities and outcome of acromegaly in Belgium. This real-life survey reveals that only half of acromegalic patients received an adequate therapy resulting in cure or disease control when stringent biochemical criteria are used."
2378355,"Hereditary tyrosinemia type I is an autosomal recessive disorder that was recognized in Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean (SLSJ) (Quebec) in 1967. Ninety-eight tyrosinemic children, including some of the 113 children born in the SLSJ region, have been screened by the Quebec Network of Genetic Medicine in the whole province since 1970. The geographical distribution of the 98 children screened showed the majority of them to have been born in the northeastern part of Quebec. The prevalence at birth was estimated at 1/1,846 live borns, and the carrier rate was estimated at 1/20 inhabitants in the SLSJ region. Three control groups matched to the tyrosinemic obligate-carrier couples were generated using the population register of the SLSJ region kept at SOREP. The mean coefficient of inbreeding was only slightly elevated in the tyrosinemic group compared with the control groups and was due to remote consanguinity. The mean kinship coefficient was 2.3 times higher in the tyrosinemic group than in the control groups. In the SLSJ region the places of origin of the tyrosinemic children and their parents did not show a clustered nonuniform distribution. Endogamy was not found to be higher in the tyrosinemic group than in the control groups. All these results support both the hypothesis of a founder effect for tyrosinemia and a high gene frequency in northeastern Quebec."
22562114,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Very few population-based studies exist on the epidemiology of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), and none have been conducted in the last decade. We aimed to determine the epidemiology and prognosis of PBC over the past two decades. METHODS: Patients were identified by multiple case finding strategies, covering the total population of Iceland. A search was conducted in the centralized database of antimitochondrial antibody (AMA) measurements and computerized diagnosis and pathological registries. All AMA measurements taken in Iceland between 1991 and 2010 were analyzed. Relevant clinical information was gathered from medical records, pathology reports, and death certificates. Incidence was compared between two periods, 1991-2000 versus 2001-2010. RESULTS: A total of 168 patients were identified, of which 138 were female (82%), with a median age 62 years (range 13-92). Prevalence at the end of the study period was 38.3 cases per 100 000 person-years. Age-standardized incidence for female patients during the first period was 3.4 versus 4.1 during the second (NS) and that for male patients was 0.6 during the first period versus 1.0 per 100 000 during the second (NS). Overall incidence in the first period was 2.0 and that in the second was 2.5 per 100 000 (NS). Stage III-IV liver fibrosis was present in 28% of patients at diagnosis with no significant differences between the two decades. Median survival after diagnosis was 15 years. Five patients underwent liver transplantation. CONCLUSION: The incidence and prevalence figures of PBC in Iceland are among the highest reported and have been stable over the last two decades. The prognosis of patients in this population-based cohort is better than that previously reported."
15854114,"Cleft lip and palate represents one of the most common developmental deformities seen in oral surgery clinics. It is usually associated with problems which include not only cosmetic and dental abnormalities, but also speech, hearing and facial growth difficulties.The purpose of the present study was to determine the prevalence of cleft lip and palate in births taking place in hospitals in the Sudan.The records of 15,890 Sudanese new-borns delivered at three hospitals during the period from 1997 to 2000 were examined.Thirteen cases of cleft lip and palate were found, demonstrating a prevalence of 0.9 per 1000. There were more girls than boys, with a male:female ratio of 3:10. Fifty-four per cent of the cases had cleft lip with cleft palate, 30% had only cleft palate and the remaining 16% had cleft lip alone.The present study was confined to hospital-based births in one city, and the true incidence of cleft lip and/or palate in the Sudan is not yet known. Findings differ from reports from other countries in terms of suggesting a higher incidence in girls."
1513060,"Clinical, pathological and follow-up data on the 1,147 cases of retinoblastoma registered in Japan from 1975 to 1982 were statistically analyzed. The cumulative survival rate of the total 1,147 cases was 93.0% at 5 years and 90.3% at 10 years, calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. The survival rate for the 757 unilateral cases was 93.3% at 5 years and 92.3% at 10 years. For the 390 bilateral cases, however, the rate was 92.2% at 5 years and 86.7% at 10 years. The Cox multivariate analysis indicated that, among the various clinical and pathological findings in the patients, extraocular invasion by the tumor was the most significant risk factor which is predictive of death due to tumor. The survival rate for patients with extraocular invasion was significantly better in cases undergoing subsequent local radiation and/or systemic chemotherapy than in cases without such aftercare. The cumulative incidence rate of second neoplasms in 409 cases of hereditary retinoblastoma was 4.8% at 10 years, 9.8% at 15 years and 15.7% at 20 years. The occurrence of a second neoplasm was the main cause of death in the hereditary cases 10 years after the first onset."
15725583,"Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy 2A (LGMD2A) is considered to be the most frequent LGMD. Our study surveyed an area in northeastern Italy where an almost complete ascertainment was possible. To identify LGMD2A patients we used a new diagnostic approach, including several molecular and biochemical methods. In 84 screened patients from northeastern Italy, we identified 39 LGMD2A patients, the prevalence of LGMD2A being 9.47 per million. In the Venezia district it appears higher than in other districts of the Veneto region, and in the Friuli region it is three times higher than in Veneto, due to the recurrence of single mutation. Haplotype analysis suggested a founder effect. The population from Venezia and Friuli has a higher risk of being heterozygote for these two mutant alleles than people from the rest of northeastern Italy. Our results indicate that LGMD2A is one of the most frequent autosomal recessive disorders, thus finding its molecular characterization becoming increasingly important."
18443215,"Reporting of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) and chronic myeloproliferative disorders (CMDs) to population-based cancer registries in the United States was initiated in 2001. In this first analysis of data from the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR), encompassing 82% of the US population, we evaluated trends in MDS and CMD incidence, estimated case numbers for the entire United States, and assessed trends in diagnostic recognition and reporting. Based on more than 40 000 observations, average annual age-adjusted incidence rates of MDS and CMD for 2001 through 2003 were 3.3 and 2.1 per 100,000, respectively. Incidence rates increased with age for both MDS and CMD (P < .05) and were highest among whites and non-Hispanics. Based on follow-up data through 2004 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program, overall relative 3-year survival rates for MDS and CMD were 45% and 80%, respectively, with males experiencing poorer survival than females. Applying the observed age-specific incidence rates to US Census population estimates, approximately 9700 patients with MDS and 6300 patients with CMD were estimated for the entire United States in 2004. MDS incidence rates significantly increased with calendar year in 2001 through 2004, and only 4% of patients were reported to registries by physicians' offices. Thus, MDS disease burden in the United States may be underestimated."
20616577,"The epidemiology of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is changing as a result of immigration to Europe and North America. Immigrants to these countries bring with them the prevalence of chronic viral hepatitis that exists in their home countries. In addition, epidemics of hepatitis C infection in Europe in the 1950-1970s and in North America in the 1960s and 1970s have produced a cohort of infected individuals who have reached a duration of infection when HCC increases in incidence. Therefore, the epidemiology of HCC parallels the epidemiology of chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis C. Whereas in Japan the peak of HCC incidence may have passed, elsewhere HCC continues to increase in incidence."
28881446,"To estimate the annual incidence, prevalence, and mortality of antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) and its subsets, granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's) (GPA), microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg-Strauss) (EGPA), in a US-based adult population.All medical records of patients with a diagnosis of, or suspicion of having, AAV in Olmsted County, Minnesota from January 1, 1996 to December 31, 2015 were reviewed. AAV incidence rates were age- and sex-adjusted to the 2010 US white population. Age- and sex-adjusted prevalence of AAV was calculated on January 1, 2015. Survival rates observed in the study cohort were compared with expected rates in the Minnesota population.Of the 58 incident cases of AAV in Olmsted County during the study period, 23 (40%) were cases of GPA, 28 (48%) were cases of MPA, and 7 (12%) were cases of EGPA. Overall, 28 (48%) of the patients with AAV were women and 57 (98%) were white. The mean ± SD age at diagnosis was 61.1 ± 16.5 years. Thirty-four patients (61%) had myeloperoxidase (MPO)-ANCAs, and 17 (30%) were positive for proteinase 3 (PR3)-ANCAs; 5 (9%) were ANCA-negative. The annual incidence of AAV was 3.3 per 100,000 population (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 2.4-4.1). The incidence rates of GPA, MPA, and EGPA were 1.3 (95% CI 0.8-1.8), 1.6 (95% CI 1.0-2.2), and 0.4 (95% CI 0.1-0.6), respectively. The overall prevalence of AAV was 42.1 per 100,000 (95% CI 29.6-54.6). The mortality rate among AAV patients overall, and among patients with EGPA, those with MPA, and those with MPO-ANCAs, was increased in comparison to the Minnesota general population (each P < 0.05), whereas mortality rates among patients with GPA, those with PR3-ANCAs, and ANCA-negative patients did not differ from that in the general population.The annual incidence of AAV in Olmsted County, Minnesota over the 20 years of the study was 3.3 per 100,000, with a prevalence of 42.1 per 100,000, which is substantially higher than the rates reported in other areas worldwide. The incidence of GPA was similar to that of MPA. Patients with MPA and those with EGPA, but not patients with GPA, experienced higher rates of mortality than that in the Minnesota general population. MPO-ANCAs were a marker of poor survival in this population of patients with AAV."
10877981,"Hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSPs), a group of neurodegenerative disorders that cause progressive spasticity of the lower limbs, are characterized by clinical and genetic heterogeneity. To date, three loci for autosomal recessive HSP have been mapped on chromosomes 8p, 16q, and 15q. After exclusion of linkage at these loci, we performed a genomewide search in a consanguineous Italian family with autosomal recessive HSP complicated by mild mental retardation and distal motor neuropathy. Using homozygosity mapping, we obtained positive LOD scores for markers on chromosome region 3q27-q28, with a maximum multipoint LOD score of 3.9 for marker D3S1601. Haplotype analysis allowed us to identify a homozygous region (4.5 cM), flanked by markers D3S1580 and D3S3669, that cosegregates with the disease. These data strongly support the presence, on chromosome 3q27-28, of a new locus for complicated recessive spastic paraplegia, which we have named ""SPG14."""
17955689,"There were four objectives in this study: (1) determine the incidence of cystic fibrosis (CF) in Ireland; (2) estimate the cost of diagnosing CF; (3) clarify the characteristics and outcomes of the nationwide diagnostic efforts and (4) identify disparities. Surveys were conducted to determine the number, methods, costs and outcomes for sweat tests in Ireland from 2001 through 2003. The results allowed us to determine that Ireland's CF incidence is the world's highest at 1:1353. The average cost for diagnosis was Euro 2663 per patient. Analyses of data in The Cystic Fibrosis Registry of Ireland revealed longer delays when diagnosis followed respiratory symptoms, rather than gastrointestinal signs, and also in girls compared to boys, particularly those presenting with respiratory symptoms. Although expenditures for diagnosing of CF in Ireland are relatively modest, the high incidence and age of diagnosis, as well as gender-related disparities, are sufficient to warrant investment in national newborn screening."
26965725,"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is a teratogen that can cross the placenta and cause the congenital varicella syndrome (CVS), which is characterised by multi-system anomalies. There have been 130 reported cases of CVS from 1947 to 2013. The estimated incidence of CVS was 0.59% and 0.84% for women infected with VZV during the entire pregnancy and for those infected the first 20 weeks of pregnancy, respectively. Nine cases were reported at 21-27 weeks of gestation and one case was identified at 36 weeks. Herpes zoster caused CVS in two cases. Regarding treatment, varicella zoster immunoglobulin treatment, irrespective of gestational age, should be considered in addition to antiviral drugs for women who have been exposed to or infected with virus."
27142780,"Mevalonate kinase deficiency (MKD), a very rare autosomal recessive autoinflammatory disease with multiple organ involvement, presents clinically as hyperimmunoglobulinemia D syndrome (HIDS), a less severe phenotype and more common form, and mevalonic aciduria (MVA), a more severe phenotype and rare form. MKD is characterized by recurrent febrile attacks that are frequently accompanied by lymphadenopathy, gastrointestinal symptoms, arthralgia, myalgia, skin rash, and aphthous ulcers. Patients with MVA also have intrauterine growth retardation, congenital defects (cataracts, shortened limbs, and dysmorphic craniofacial features), neurological disease, and failure to thrive. Mean age at onset of symptoms is within the first year of life. There is a delay by several years between symptom onset and diagnosis, which is in part attributable to the initial misdiagnosis due to the rarity and nonspecific clinical manifestations of disease. The frequency of recurrent febrile attacks is highest in childhood and gradually decreases after adolescence. MKD is associated with rare long-term complications such as type AA amyloidosis, joint contractures, abdominal adhesions, renal angiomyolipoma, and severe pneumococcal infections. Frequent febrile attacks significantly impair several aspects of patients' and caregivers' quality of life, with an adverse impact on patients' daily activities, education, and employment. Lifespan is generally normal for HIDS whereas MVA can be fatal in early childhood."
9928642,"OBJECTIVE:Determination of the prevalence of arthrogryposis multiplex congenita in Western Australia as well as the causes of the condition. Overseas reports varied considerably and no such survey had been conducted in Western Australia. METHODOLOGY:Case names were obtained from various registers and records as well as from private practitioners covering the 14 years birth cohort between 1980 and 1993. The records, and where possible the patients, were seen by one of the authors. Diagnosis was further established through relevant investigation where possible. RESULTS:Thirty cases were identified, giving a birth prevalence of approximately 1 in 12000. In nine cases there were significant abnormalities of the central nervous system, in seven cases anterior horn cell and/or peripheral nervous involvement was the cause and in three there was primary muscle disease. The remaining 11 had various syndromes for which no definite neuropathological lesions could be demonstrated, but most of these had syndromes such as distal arthrogryposis or amyoplasia. Mortality was 37%. Talipes occurred in 23 of 30 cases. Early intervention and, in more severe cases, radical surgical intervention was the management adopted in most cases. CONCLUSION:The birth prevalence of arthrogryposis in Western Australia is somewhat less than that reported in Canada and Finland but somewhat greater than the Edinburgh figures, which appear to be the extremes quoted in the literature. Prognosis is worse in cases with serious central nervous system involvement and/or chest involvement, and better in cases of localised arthrogryposis (e.g. distal), as well as in the specific syndrome of amyoplasia as described by Hall."
18463683,"Oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) is a genetically heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by absent or reduced pigmentation of the skin, hair, and eyes. In humans, four genes have been associated with ""classical"" OCA and another 12 genes with syndromic forms of OCA. To assess the prevalence of different forms of OCA and different gene mutations among non-Hispanic Caucasian patients, we performed DNA sequence analysis of the four genes associated with ""classical"" OCA (TYR, OCA2, TYRP1, SLC45A2), the two principal genes associated with syndromic OCA (HPS1, HPS4), and a candidate OCA gene (SILV), in 121 unrelated, unselected non-Hispanic/Latino Caucasian patients carrying the clinical diagnosis of OCA. We identified apparent pathologic TYR gene mutations in 69% of patients, OCA2 mutations in 18%, SLC45A2 mutations in 6%, and no apparent pathological mutations in 7% of patients. We found no mutations of TYRP1, HPS1, HPS4, or SILV in any patients. Although we observed a diversity of mutations for each gene, a relatively small number of different mutant alleles account for a majority of the total. This study demonstrates that, contrary to long-held clinical lore, OCA1, not OCA2, is by far the most frequent cause of OCA among Caucasian patients."
21056448,"Acute zonal occult outer retinopathy (AZOOR) is a rare unilateral or bilateral disease of unknown etiology characterized by focal degeneration of photoreceptors. A total of 131 cases of AZOOR (205 eyes), including the variant known as acute annular outer retinopathy, have been reported in the English language literature. In this group of predominantly white individuals, average age at presentation was 36.7 years, and the male:female ratio was 1:3.2. The majority of patients complained of the acute onset of a scotoma, which was associated with photopsia. Visual acuity was 20/40 or better in 74% of tested eyes, and fundus examination was unremarkable in 76% of eyes. Blind spot enlargement, with or without other field defects, was observed in 75% of the visual fields examined, and electroretinographic abnormalities were recorded in 99% of patients tested. Typically patients retained good visual acuity, although retinal pigment epithelial disturbances commonly developed over time. It was unusual for visual field loss to continue beyond six months. Various treatments have been attempted in patients with AZOOR--including systemic corticosteroids, other systemic immunosuppressive agents, and different antimicrobials--but none have been proven effective."
7490992,"Wolfram syndrome is the association of diabetes mellitus and optic atrophy, and is sometimes called DIDMOAD (diabetes insipidus, diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, and deafness). Incomplete characterisation of this autosomal recessive syndrome has relied on case-reports, and there is confusion with mitochondrial genome disorders. We therefore undertook a UK nationwide cross-sectional case-finding study to describe the natural history, complications, prevalence, and inheritance of the syndrome. We identified 45 patients with Wolfram syndrome--a prevalence of one per 770,000. Non-autoimmune, insulin-deficient diabetes mellitus presented at a median age of 6 years, followed by optic atrophy (11 years). Cranial diabetes insipidus occurred in 33 patients (73%) with sensorineural deafness (28, 62%) in the second decade; renal-tract abnormalities (26, 58%) presented in the third decade followed by neurological complications (cerebellar ataxia, myoclonus [28, 62%]) in the fourth decade. Other abnormalities included gastrointestinal dysmotility in 11 (24%), and primary gonadal atrophy in seven of ten males investigated. Median age at death (commonly central respiratory failure with brain-stem atrophy) was 30 years (range 25-49). The natural history of Wolfram syndrome suggests that most patients will eventually develop most complications of this progressive, neurodegenerative disorder. Family studies indicate autosomal recessive inheritance with a carrier frequency of one in 354, an absence of a maternal history of diabetes or deafness, and an absence of the mitochondrial tRNA Leu (3243) mutation. Juvenile-onset diabetes mellitus and optic atrophy are the best available diagnostic criteria for Wolfram syndrome, the differential diagnosis of which includes other causes of neurodegeneration."
19248123,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of systemic sclerosis (SSc) using population-based administrative data, and to assess the sensitivity of case ascertainment approaches. METHODS: We ascertained SSc cases from Quebec physician billing and hospitalization databases (covering approximately 7.5 million individuals). Three case definition algorithms were compared, and statistical methods accounting for imperfect case ascertainment were used to estimate SSc prevalence and case ascertainment sensitivity. A hierarchical Bayesian latent class regression model that accounted for possible between-test dependence conditional on disease status estimated the effect of patient characteristics on SSc prevalence and the sensitivity of the 3 ascertainment algorithms. RESULTS: Accounting for error inherent in both the billing and the hospitalization data, we estimated SSc prevalence in 2003 at 74.4 cases per 100,000 women (95% credible interval [95% CrI] 69.3-79.7) and 13.3 cases per 100,000 men (95% CrI 11.1-16.1). Prevalence was higher for older individuals, particularly in urban women (161.2 cases per 100,000, 95% CrI 148.6-175.0). Prevalence was lowest in young men (in rural areas, as low as 2.8 cases per 100,000, 95% CrI 1.4-4.8). In general, no single algorithm was very sensitive, with point estimates for sensitivity ranging from 20-73%. CONCLUSION: We found marked differences in SSc prevalence according to age, sex, and region. In general, no single case ascertainment approach was very sensitive for SSc. Therefore, using data from multiple sources, with adjustment for the imperfect nature of each, is an important strategy in population-based studies of SSc and similar conditions."
12654973,"The authors searched for mutations in the beta-amyloid precursor protein in a Spanish family with a hereditary syndrome of hemorrhagic stroke, dementia, leukoencephalopathy, and occipital calcifications. DNA from two affected members demonstrated the Iowa amyloid precursor protein mutation previously identified as a cause of severe amyloid angiopathy without hemorrhagic stroke. These data point to other genetic or environmental factors that may determine the occurrence of symptomatic hemorrhage in amyloid angiopathy."
22002878,"Sirenomelia is a very rare limb anomaly in which the normally paired lower limbs are replaced by a single midline limb. This study describes the prevalence, associated malformations, and maternal characteristics among cases with sirenomelia. Data originated from 19 birth defect surveillance system members of the International Clearinghouse for Birth Defects Surveillance and Research, and were reported according to a single pre-established protocol. Cases were clinically evaluated locally and reviewed centrally. A total of 249 cases with sirenomelia were identified among 25,290,172 births, for a prevalence of 0.98 per 100,000, with higher prevalence in the Mexican registry. An increase of sirenomelia prevalence with maternal age less than 20 years was statistically significant. The proportion of twinning was 9%, higher than the 1% expected. Sex was ambiguous in 47% of cases, and no different from expectation in the rest. The proportion of cases born alive, premature, and weighting less than 2,500 g were 47%, 71.2%, and 88.2%, respectively. Half of the cases with sirenomelia also presented with genital, large bowel, and urinary defects. About 10-15% of the cases had lower spinal column defects, single or anomalous umbilical artery, upper limb, cardiac, and central nervous system defects. There was a greater than expected association of sirenomelia with other very rare defects such as bladder exstrophy, cyclopia/holoprosencephaly, and acardia-acephalus. The application of the new biological network analysis approach, including molecular results, to these associated very rare diseases is suggested for future studies."
16549414,"To determine the prevalence of syringomyelia in a defined population in New Zealand and measure the prevalence of syringomyelia in the three main ethnic groups (Maori, Pacific people and Caucasians/others) living in this region.A retrospective study of all confirmed cases of syringomyelia diagnosed in residents of northern New Zealand from 1961 to 2003.In all, syringomyelia was diagnosed in 137 patients. The mean age at onset of symptoms was 27.5 years and mean age at diagnosis was 32.6 years. The incidence of new cases increased from 0.76/100,000 a year between 1962 and 1971 to 4.70/100,000 a year by 1992-2001. The prevalence of syringomyelia in 2003 was 8.2/100,000 people: 5.4/100,000 in Caucasians or others, 15.4/100,000 in Maori and 18.4/100,000 in Pacific people (chi2 = 37.0, p<0.0001). Syringomyelia was more often associated with an isolated Chiari I malformation in Pacific people (84.4%) as compared with 42.9% of Maori and 38.2% of Caucasians or others (chi2 = 62.3, p<0.0001).The prevalence of syringomyelia is higher in northern New Zealand than in studies carried out before the advent of magnetic resonance imaging. The prevalence is particularly high in Maori and Pacific people. The cause of the ethnic differences in the prevalence of syringomyelia identified in this study is unexplained and warrants further investigation."
22000705,"BACKGROUND: Previous reports on the prevalence of autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI) were based on single source data, such as lists of members in a patient association. These sources are likely to be incomplete. OBJECTIVES: We sought to describe the prevalence of ARCI. METHODS: We obtained data from 3 incomplete sources (dermatology departments, a genetic testing laboratory, and the Spanish ichthyosis association) and combined them using the capture-recapture method. RESULTS: We identified 144 living patients with ARCI. Of these, 62.5% had classic lamellar ichthyosis and 30.6% had congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma. The age distribution included fewer elderly patients than expected. The prevalence of ARCI in patients younger than 10 years, the best estimate as less subject to bias, was 16.2 cases per million inhabitants (95% confidence interval 13.3-23.0). According to the capture-recapture model, 71% of the patients were not being followed up in reference units, 92% did not have a genetic diagnosis, and 78% were not members of the ichthyosis association. LIMITATIONS: The prevalence of ARCI in Spain and findings related to the Spanish health care system might not be generalizable to other countries. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of ARCI is higher than previously reported. Many patients are not being followed up in reference units, do not have a genetic diagnosis, and are not members of a patient association, indicating room for improvement in their care. Data suggesting a reduced number of older patients might imply a shorter life expectancy and this requires further study."
15190193,"Disorders of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) are renowned for their variability in clinical features and genetic causes. This makes it difficult to determine their true prevalence, but recent studies have documented a minimum birth prevalence of 13.1/100000 or 1/7634 for oxidative phosphorylation disorders with onset at any age. This clearly remains an underestimate but it indicates that oxidative phosphorylation disorders can be regarded as the most common group of inborn errors of metabolism. Pathogenic mutations causing human oxidative phosphorylation disorders have now been identified in more than 30 of the 37 mitochondrial DNA genes and in more than 30 nuclear genes. Most of the nuclear gene defects cause autosomal recessive diseases, but autosomal dominant and X-linked disorders also occur. It is likely that at least another 30, and perhaps over 100, nuclear-encoded oxidative phosphorylation disorders await identification. Oxidative phosphorylation genetics are complex and there appear to be a number of common misconceptions about mitochondrial DNA mutations that may impede optimal investigation and management of patients. In our experience, mitochondrial DNA mutations are not a negligible cause of OXPHOS disorders in children but account for 20-25% of cases. Similarly, a family history suggesting maternal inheritance is the exception rather than the norm for children with mitochondrial DNA mutations, many of whom have de novo mutations. Only some mitochondrial DNA mutations disappear from cultured cells, so deficient enzyme activity in fibroblasts does not imply the presence of a nuclear defect. Finally, it is still widely thought that there are very few reproductive options that can be offered to women at risk of transmitting a mitochondrial DNA mutation. While a cautious approach is needed, there is now a consensus that prenatal diagnosis should be offered to some women, particularly those at lower recurrence risk. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis can also be an option."
23321618,"There is uncertainty over the population prevalence of people with Down's syndrome in England and Wales. This study aimed to estimate the population prevalence of Down's syndrome in England and Wales in 2011. A meta-analysis of published survival rates of people with Down's syndrome from 1938 to 2010 was conducted and the results were applied to the estimated numbers of babies born with Down's syndrome since 1938 in England and Wales. An estimated 37 090 people had Down's syndrome in England and Wales in 2011, a population prevalence of 0.66 per 1000 people; 650 under 1, 2673 aged 1-5, 7115 aged 5-18, 12819 aged 19-40, 10 626 aged 41-55 and 3207 aged 56 and older. The average life expectancy for babies with Down's syndrome born in 2011 was 51 years and the median life expectancy was 58 years. This study provides clarity on the number of people with Down's syndrome in England and Wales. Owing to sudden increases in the survival of babies with Down's syndrome in the 1950s there are a large proportion of people with Down's syndrome who are in their 40s. These people have an increased risk of developing dementia in the future and services should be aware of their potential needs."
23815477,"OBJECTIVE: In this study we aimed to assess the incidence, prevalence and clinical outcomes of patients with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) in southern Israel. METHODS: Case-finding methods and population-based administrative data were used to evaluate the epidemiology and prognostic factors of AIH from 1995 to 2010. RESULTS: During the study period, the average annual prevalence and incidence of AIH in southern Israel were 11.0/100000 and 0.67/100000, respectively. We identified 100 AIH cases with a mean age of 47.9 years, including 95 women and five men. Type 1 AIH was found in 77 cases, and liver fibrosis and cirrhosis were found in 73.4% and 22.3% of all patients who underwent liver biopsy. In all, 98 patients were treated with a combination of steroids and azathioprine or steroids alone (prednisone and azathioprine in 71, budesonide and azathioprine in 11, prednisone or budesonide alone in six and ten, respectively). Complete remission was recorded in 56 patients, whereas partial response or failure of treatment was noted in 42 patients. In multivariate analysis the independent predictors of remission were the degree of liver fibrosis (mild vs bridging fibrosis (F3) and cirrhosis [F4]) (P=0.003) and level of albumin (P=0.031). The estimated 1-year and 10-year survival for AIH were 96.5% and 89.7%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of AIH in Israel is quite similar to that of other European Caucasian populations, with a relatively long-term good prognosis, despite a low rate of response to immunosuppressive therapy."
6512829,"Using multiple sources, an attempt was made to ascertain all symptomatic cases of retinitis pigmentosa living in the City of Birmingham in June 1978. These methods revealed a prevalence for all ages of 1 in 4869 and a prevalence in the age group 45 to 64 years of 1 in 3195. There was a higher prevalence than expected among young Muslims with consanguineous parents. However, the most accurate prevalence of uncomplicated retinitis pigmentosa among adults was considered to be that found in an outpatient clinic serving adult diabetics, namely, six patients in a clinic population of 8000 to 10 000."
10196704,"Nephronophthisis--medullary cystic kidney disease is a progressive chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis leading to terminal renal failure. About two thirds of the patients with familial juvenile nephronophthisis, an autosomal recessive disease, have a homozygous deletion at the gene locus on 2q13. Through a nationwide search, 59 patients were ascertained in Finland. The incidence was 1:61,800 live births when calculated over a 20-year period. Of the patients, 17 came from four families showing dominant inheritance and 37 patients from 28 apparently recessive families when classified by family history, clinical features or presence of a deletion on 2q13. Two were considered as new dominant mutations; three sporadic patients could not be classified. The most significant difference between the patients with deletions, patients without deletions but having recessive family history, and patients belonging to families with dominant inheritance was the age at first symptoms, at the start of dialysis and at transplantation. These facts will be of help in determining the mode of inheritance of a sporadic patient without a deletion."
20622343,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Individual inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) are rare disorders, but may not be that uncommon in our patient population. We report the incidence of IEM in a defined cohort of births at the Saudi Aramco medical facilities in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia over 25 years. METHODS: The records of all patients diagnosed with IEM from 1 January 1983 to 31 December 2008 were reviewed and categorized according to accumulated or deficient metabolites into small-molecule disorders (aminoacidemia, organic acidopathies [OA], urea cycle defects, fatty acid oxidation, and carbohydrate metabolic disorders) and other disorders, including glycogen and lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs), and organelle disorders. RESULTS: During the study period, 165,530 Saudi Arabian infants were born at Saudi Aramco and 248 were diagnosed with an IEM, corresponding to a cumulative incidence of 150 cases per 100,000 live births. Small-molecule disorders were diagnosed in 134/248 patients (54%). OA were the most common (48/248 patients; 19%), and methylmalonic aciduria was the most frequently observed OA (13/48 patients; 27%). LSDs were diagnosed in 74/248 patients (30%), and mucopolysaccharidosis was the most frequently observed LSD (28/74; 38%). CONCLUSION: We believe that our data underestimate the true incidence of IEM in the region. Regional and national newborn screening programs will provide a better estimation of the incidence of IEM. We recommend a centralized newborn screening program that employs tandem mass spectrometry."
19430667,"By 1997, an open cohort of 1,652 live newborn of 1,637 mothers with gestational toxoplasmosis had been recruited in the Campania region to monitor the burden of congenital toxoplasmosis (CT). Of the 1,556 mother-child pairs that completed the follow up, 92 definite cases were detected, yielding a 5.9% (4.8-7.1 95% CI) transmission rate. The onset was patent for 43% of patients and sensorineural complications were shown for a further 15% of subclinical onset patients later than two years of age. The overall prevalence of toxoplasmosis during gestation was 2.46 of 1,000 deliveries, while the prevalence of definite CT was 1.38 of 10,000 live newborns. However, there is still room for intervention, as only 23% of the maternal diagnoses were proven through seroconversion, 63 of the late-gestation seroconverters remained untreated, and six probable CT diagnoses were made following referrals due to patent sequelae and born during the study period. There was a positive secular trend on the rates of infant referral and definite CT diagnosis, according to the live birth rate (Chi2 for trend < 0.001). Extension of this surveillance system across the country could help to define a future strategy for prevention."
22752412,"All seven recognized human cases of Hendra virus (HeV) infection have occurred in Queensland, Australia. Recognized human infections have all resulted from a HeV infected horse that was unusually efficient in transmitting the virus and a person with a high exposure to infectious secretions. In the large outbreak in Malaysia where Nipah virus (NiV) was first identified, most human infections resulted from close contact with NiV infected pigs. Outbreak investigations in Bangladesh have identified drinking raw date palm sap as the most common pathway of NiV transmission from Pteropus bats to people, but person-to-person transmission of NiV has been repeatedly identified in Bangladesh and India. Although henipaviruses are not easily transmitted to people, these newly recognized, high mortality agents warrant continued scientific attention."
25404155,"Morquio A (MPS IVA) is a rare disease characterised by a deficiency of N-acetylgalactosamine-6 sulfatase (GALNS) and presenting with short stature, abnormal gait, cervical spine instability and shortened lifespan.To prepare a systematic review of the prevalence of Morquio A in multiple countries and suggest recommendations for reporting rare diseases.Medline, Medline In-Process, Medline Daily Update, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, Health Technology Assessment Database and PROSPERO were searched from inception to October 2013 to identify relevant information on the epidemiology of Morquio A. Forty Patient Organisation Representatives (POR) and Key Opinion Leaders (KOL) across 24 countries were contacted for data. Observational studies were included and case reports were excluded. Searches were performed without date or language restriction. Two researchers independently screened and extracted data. Quality of study reporting was assessed using a checklist adapted from STROBE (STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology). Point or birth prevalence was stratified according to diagnostic method and discussed narratively.In total 9,074 records were retrieved from searching and 25 studies were included for data extraction. Twenty out of 40 KOL and POR responded (50%) and 9 provided data (23%). Point prevalence of Morquio A was 1 per 926,000 in Australia, 1 per 1,872,000 in Malaysia and 1 per 599,000 in UK and Morquio (unclassified) was 1 per 323, 000 in Denmark. Birth prevalence of Morquio A (using recommended diagnostic methods) ranged from 1 per 71,000 in UAE to 1 per 500,000 in Japan. All results were compromised by poor study reporting and internal validity.The review highlighted that there is a misunderstanding of the definitions for prevalence and incidence in the field; that studies were poorly reported (diagnostic methods and patient characteristics) and that no suitable quality assessment tool exists. Overestimation and underestimation of prevalence data can occur. Bespoke reporting guidelines and a quality assessment tool specifically for prevalence of rare diseases are recommended."
12008686,"We report the incidence and epidemiology of 21-hydroxylase deficiency in Singapore, based on a retrospective study of all known patients diagnosed with classical 21-hydroxylase deficiency in the past 21 years. The database was obtained from the case registry and questionnaire methodology, with 100% coverage of all practising pediatricians in Singapore. There were 42 patients affected with 21-hydroxylase deficiency in 964,558 live births over 21 years, comprising 64.3% salt wasters and 35.7% simple virilizers, of whom 50.0% were males and 50.0% females. The incidence of classical 21-hydroxylase deficiency is 4.5 per 100,000 live births, with a carrier frequency of 1:76, and a gene frequency of 0.0067. Although retrospective studies have inherent limitations, the gender and phenotype ratios suggest that the data provide a crude incidence level. This study underscores the necessity for prospective neonatal screening, so that the benefits of early diagnosis and treatment can be realized."
25805746,"It is now 25 years since the first European studies on vasculitis--the anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) standardization project. Over that period of time, there have been major developments in the classification of the vasculitides, which has permitted the conduct of high-quality epidemiology studies. Studying the epidemiology of rare diseases such as the ANCA-associated vasculitides (AAV) poses considerable challenges to epidemiologists. The first is the need for a clear definition of a case with good differentiation from similar disorders. The second is case capture. The vasculitides are rare, and therefore, a large population is required to determine the incidence and prevalence, and this poses questions of feasibility. A large population increases the risk of incomplete case detection but permits a reasonable number of cases to be collected in a practicable time frame, whereas a smaller population requires a much longer time frame to collect the necessary cases, which may also not be feasible. Statistical methods of capture-recapture analysis enable estimates to be made of the number of missing cases. The third is case ascertainment. The AAV are virtually always managed in secondary care, and therefore, hospital-based case ascertainment may be appropriate. Fourthly, the rarity of the conditions makes prospective case-control studies investigating risk factors difficult to conduct because the population size required to achieve statistical confidence is in excess of that which is readily available. Thus, much of the data on risk factors are derived from retrospective studies with inherent potential bias."
25142309,"The rise in incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the United States has been well documented. The purpose of this analysis was to examine temporal trends in HCC incidence, mortality, and survival within the U.S. population. The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data were used to examine incidence and incidence-based (IB) mortality in HCC from 1973 to 2011. Secular trends in age-adjusted incidence and IB mortality by sex and cancer stage were characterized using the Joinpoint Regression program. In 1973, HCC incidence was 1.51 cases per 100,000, whereas in 2011, HCC incidence was 6.20 cases per 100,000. Although HCC incidence continues to increase, a slowing of the rate of increase occurs around 2006. In a sensitivity analysis, there was no significant increase in incidence and IB mortality from 2009 to 2011. There was a significant increase in overall median survival from the 1970s to 2000s (2 vs. 8 months; P < 0.001). On multivariable Cox's regression analysis, age, sex, race, tumor grade, stage at diagnosis, lymph/vascular invasion, number of primary tumors, tumor size, and liver transplant were independently associated with mortality.Our results indicate a deceleration in the incidence of HCC around 2006. Since 2009 and for the first time in four decades, there is no increase in IB mortality and incidence rates for HCC in the U.S. population. The nonsignificant increase in incidence and IB mortality in recent years suggest that the peak of the HCC epidemic may be near. A significant survival improvement in HCC was also noted from 1973 to 2010, which seems to be driven by earlier detection of HCC at a curative stage and greater utilization of curative modalities (especially transplant)."
11372296,"BACKGROUND: ECLAMC is a registry, aimed to assess the incidence of congenital malformations, that started in 1967 and Chile incorporated to it in 1969. AIM: To report the incidence of cleft lip/palate, updated to 1999 in the University of Chile Maternity Hospital and other Chilean hospitals participating in the ECLAMC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A review of the ECLAMC database that registers all births or stillbirths of more than 500 g. RESULTS: The incidence of orofacial cleft, at the University of Chile Maternity Hospital, in the period 1991-1999 was 17.8 per 10,000 (12.6 for cleft lip and 5.2 for cleft palate). The incidence in the rest of participating hospitals was 12.04 and 4.6 respectively. Males had a higher incidence of cleft lip and 80% of children with cleft palate, had other malformations, most of them as part of a syndrome (13 and 18 trisomy, holoproscencephalia, Pierre Robin, Apert en EE syndromes, anencephaly etc). In three of 12 children with cleft lip but without cleft palate, there was a relative with the same malformation. CONCLUSIONS: It is proposed that both entities, cleft lip with or without cleft palate and cleft palate without cleft lip, are two etiopathogenically different conditions."
2096315,"Hereditary ataxias, hereditary spastic paraplegia and Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome (HA) are chronic progressive neurological diseases. Epidemiologic studies of these disorders are few. In a geographically well-defined Danish population, we present incidence rates, cumulated incidence rates and prevalence for patients with HA based on modern continuous-time survival analysis techniques. From these, prevalence has been estimated to be 6.06 per 10(5) in the 10 to 50-year-old population. Combined risk of HA was found to be 0.16% for women and 0.20% for men up to their 51st birthday."
21927854,"Alkaptonuria (AKU) is an autosomal recessive disorder due to homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase (HGD) deficiency in the liver and characterized by a triad of signs, according to chronology of appearance: homogentisic aciduria (HGA) or alkaptonuria, ochronosis then ochronotic arthropathy. This inborn error of metabolism is caused by mutations in the HGD gene. In this work we report observations of 96 AKU French patients from 81 families collected in the literature since 1882 and from our personal contribution since 1986, giving an incidence of the disease of around 1:680,000 (96/64.10(6)). As expected for an autosomal recessive disorder the main findings of this study were: a slight predominance of males (51/93, 54,8%) over females (42/93, 45,2%), a strong predominance of sibships with one affected individual (68/81, 84,0%) over sibships with two (11/81, 13.6%) and three(2/81, 2.4%) affected individuals. AKU families are scaterred among the French territory suggesting that most cases occured in non-consanguineous unions. Consanguinity was only found in five families. Other peculiarities of this study were (a) ten of these families have both parents from a foreign geographical origin: Poland(3), Italy(3), Portugal(2), Ukraine(1) and India(1) and four families with only one foreign parent (Algeria, Armenia, Serbia, UK), (b) HGD mutations were found in 23 families, (c) four of theses 96 patients were seen by us respectively 28, 29, 39 and 45 years after their report in the literature and (d) seven patients present cardiac and/or renal complications."
19233912,"BACKGROUND:Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) occurs in sporadic (sPCT) and familial (fPCT) forms, which are generally clinically indistinguishable and have traditionally been differentiated by erythrocyte uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD, EC 4.1.1.37) activity. We used UROD gene sequencing as the reference standard in assessing the diagnostic accuracy of UROD activity, evaluating the mutation spectrum of the UROD gene, determining the frequency and disease attributes of PCT and its subtypes in Norway, and developing diagnostic models that use clinical and laboratory characteristics for differentiating fPCT and sPCT. METHODS:All consecutive patients with PCT diagnosed within a 6-year period were used for incidence calculations. UROD activity analysis, UROD gene sequencing, analysis of hemochromatosis mutations, and registration of clinical and laboratory data were carried out for 253 patients. RESULTS:Fifty-three percent of the patients had disease-relevant mutations, 74% of which were c.578G>C or c.636+1G>C. The UROD activity at the optimal cutoff had a likelihood ratio (LR) of 9.2 for fPCT, whereas a positive family history had an LR of 19. A logistic regression model indicated that low UROD activity, a high uroporphyrin-heptaporphyrin ratio, a young age at diagnosis, male sex, and low alcohol consumption were predictors of fPCT. The incidence of PCT was 1 in 100 000. CONCLUSIONS:Two commonly occurring mutations are responsible for the high frequency of fPCT in Norway. UROD activity has a high diagnostic accuracy for differentiating the 2 PCT types, and a model that takes into account both clinical information and laboratory test results can be used to predict fPCT."
21525528,"BACKGROUND:Previous studies have shown that the incidence of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is rising in the U.K. and U.S.A. Death registrations and primary care data were used to determine the current trends in IPF incidence in the U.K. Because routine clinical data sets were used, the term IPF clinical syndrome (IPF-CS) is used to describe individuals in this study. METHODS:Age- and stratum-specific death registration rates between 1968 and 2008 were calculated and these were applied to the 2008 population to generate annual standardised expected number of deaths. Annual mortality rate ratios were calculated using Poisson regression. Computerised primary care records were used to determine incidence rates of IPF-CS between 2000 and 2008 stratified by age, sex and geographical region, and survival rates between calendar periods were compared. RESULTS:Annual death certificate recording of IPF-CS rose sixfold across the study period from 0.92 per 100,000 in the 1968-1972 calendar periods to 5.10 per 100,000 in the 2006-2008 calendar period, and were higher in men and the older age groups. The incidence of IPF-CS in primary care increased by 35% from 2000 to 2008, with an overall incidence rate of 7.44 per 100,000 person-years (95% CI 7.12 to 7.77). Incidence was higher in men, the older population and in Northwest England. CONCLUSIONS:The incidence of IPF-CS in primary care and registered deaths from this cause in the U.K. continues to rise in the 21st century. The current findings suggest that there are >5000 new cases diagnosed each year in the U.K."
15254556,"Kernicterus, thought to be due to severe hyperbilirubinemia, is an uncommon disorder with tragic consequences, especially when it affects healthy term and near-term infants. Early identification, prevention and treatment of severe hyperbilirubinemia should make kernicterus a preventable disease. However, national epidemiologic data are needed to monitor any preventive strategies. Recommendations are provided to obtain prospective data on the prevalence and incidence of severe hyperbilirubinemia and associate mortality and neurologic injury using standardized definitions, explore the clinical characteristics and root causes of kernicterus in children identified in the Kernicterus Pilot Registry, identify and test an indicator for population surveillance, validating systems-based approaches to the management of newborn jaundice, and explore the feasibility of using biologic or genetic markers to identify infants at risk for hyperbilirubinemia. Increased knowledge about the incidence and consequences of severe hyperbilirubinemia is essential to the planning, implementation and assessment of interventions to ensure that infants discharged as healthy from their birth hospitals have a safer transition to home, avoiding morbidity due to hyperbilirubinemia and other disorders. At a recent NIHCD-sponsored conference, key questions were raised about kernicterus and the need for additional strategies for its prevention. These questions and an approach to their answers form the basis of this report."
19760683,"BACKGROUND: Few studies have investigated the epidemiologic features of clinically defined subgroups of anotia/microtia. METHODS: Data on cases of anotia and/or microtia among 1999-2005 deliveries were obtained from the Texas Birth Defects Registry, a population-based active surveillance system. We determined crude and adjusted associations between selected factors and seven clinical subgroups of anotia/microtia. RESULTS: In total, 742 cases were diagnosed with anotia and/or microtia, corresponding to a prevalence of 2.86 per 10,000 live births. Of those, 45% had no other major birth defect (""isolated""), 77% were unilateral, and 22% bilateral. Anotia alone made up 6%, whereas microtia made up 94%. Birth prevalence was higher with increasing maternal age and among Mexico-born Hispanics. Compared to white mothers, Hispanic mothers were two-to-three times more likely to have infants with all but the syndromic and bilateral groups (adjusted prevalence ratios [aPRs] = 2.05-2.61). Non-Hispanic blacks had significantly lower risk for total anotia/microtia, and for the isolated, unilateral, and microtia subgroups (aPRs = 0.42-0.64). Less educated mothers were three-to-four times more likely to have children with anotia (aPRs = 2.98 for less than high school, 3.97 for high school graduates). Males were more likely to be born with total anotia/microtia and with syndromic, unilateral, and microtia subtypes (aPRs = 1.27-1.41). CONCLUSIONS: In Texas, most anotia/microtia cases were in the unilateral and microtia groups, and 45% were isolated. Several clinical subgroups exhibited higher prevalence in males and among older mothers. Relative to whites, blacks were at lower risk and Hispanics (especially Mexico-born mothers) were at higher risk for selected types of anotia/microtia."
18204270,"To determine the incidence of classical 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21-OHD) in Estonia from 1978 to 2004, and describe their phenotype and genotype.All Estonian endocrinologists informed us about their patients with 21-OHD. The diagnosis was confirmed in 20 patients, who were all screened for 8 common mutations of the CYP21A2 gene.The 27-year period incidence was 1:25,500. The incidence from 1992 was 1:16,100, which more accurately reflects the real situation in Estonia. The salt-wasting form (SW) was diagnosed in 14 (7 males) and the simple virilizing form in 6 patients (1 male). The median age at diagnosis of the SW form was 30 days in males and 2 days in females. The investigation of 34 unrelated alleles showed that a common deletion/conversion was the most frequent mutation in our group (7/34). Six other mutations were present: p.Ile172Asn (5/34), 8-bp deletion (3/34), intron-2 splice mutation (3/34), p.Arg356Trp (3/34), p.Gln318X (3/34) and a small conversion (2/34). Mutations in 8 alleles remained uncertain.The incidence of classical 21-OHD in Estonia in 1992-2004 was 1:16,100. The genotype of our patients is similar to those from other Caucasian populations. The relatively late age at diagnosis and the skewed female:male ratio supports the need for newborn screening for 21-OHD."
19200301,"The age-adjusted prevalence of immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is estimated to be 9.5 per 100,000 persons in the USA while its annual incidence is estimated to be 2.68 per 100,000 in Northern Europe (at a cut-off platelet count of <100 x 10(9)/L). The mean age of adults at diagnosis in Europe is 50 yrs and the incidence of ITP increases with age. Both the treatments used to treat patients with ITP and the disease itself can impact on patient health-related quality of life (HRQoL). As the incidence of ITP in Europe rises, especially in the elderly, the number of patients with a decreased HRQoL is increasing. Literature searches and focus groups have aided the development of a conceptual model to assess HRQoL. In this model, low platelet counts and the associated symptoms of ITP in addition to the side effects of treatment are proposed as the main determinants of a negatively impacted HRQoL. Primary conceptual domains of HRQoL, affected in patients with ITP, include emotional health, functional health, work, social and leisure activities and reproductive health. As treatment benefits are likely to improve these domains, the conceptual model could be used for better management of patients, taking into account HRQoL. The short-form 36-item questionnaire (SF-36) and the ITP Patient Assessment Questionnaire (ITP-PAQ) are validated measures of HRQoL which can provide a comprehensive assessment of numerous factors to help evaluate decisions about patient management. Future clinical trials investigating treatment options for ITP should assess HRQoL using these validated questionnaires."
9314356,"BACKGROUND:Primary immunodeficiency disorders (PIDs) are uncommon conditions that require specialized immunologic services for diagnosis and management. It is difficult to estimate the prevalence of these disorders from routinely collected health statistics. OBJECTIVE:We attempted to describe the prevalence of PID in Australia and the requirements for specific therapies, such as intravenous immunoglobulin, ascertained from a national register of PID. METHODS:A national longitudinal cross-sectional survey of patients with PID under the care of clinical immunologists was established by the Australasian Society of Allergy and Clinical Immunology in 1990. Details of diagnosis and therapy were provided for patients with major PIDs including symptomatic IgA, IgG subclass, and complement deficiencies. Subjects with asymptomatic IgA deficiency were not included. The clinical features of the first 500 cases enrolled in the register were analyzed. RESULTS:The most frequent type of PID was predominant antibody deficiency (71%). Common variable immunodeficiency, usually first seen as an antibody deficiency, was the single most common disorder with an estimated prevalence of 0.77/100,000 in the general population. Other types of PID were infrequent, and of these, severe combined immunodeficiency accounted for 5.2% of cases. The estimated prevalence of all forms of chronic granulomatous disease was 0.08/100,000. The national prevalence of all PID cases ascertained from the register was 2.1/100,000, with variation between the larger states ranging from 1.18 to 4.57/100,000. Half (247) of the patients were receiving intravenous immunoglobulin therapy with a median duration of care of 5 to 9 years for the different antibody deficiencies. There was also variation in the patterns of intravenous immunoglobulin use across the country. No new forms of PID were encountered. CONCLUSION:This study highlights the requirement for the continuing provision of immunoglobulin as replacement therapy for these patients. In addition, the register documents a cohort of patients with PID whose long-term response to current therapy can be evaluated prospectively."
11641035,"BACKGROUND:In France, neonatal screening of phenylketonuria (PKU) started in 1966. A national association was created in 1978 in order to organise the neonatal screening program and to control the efficacy of the screening and patients' follow-up. AIMS:To evaluate the results of the French PKU screening program in terms of hyperphenylalaninaemia epidemiology, efficacy of the screening procedure, management and outcome of the patients. STUDY DESIGN:The national database has been filled-up first with the answers to questionnaires that were sent each year by the PKU patients' physicians, and second with the results of an additional inquiry, which was set up in 1994 in order to investigate diagnosis, treatment, and school outcome of all French PKU patients. RESULTS:PKU was diagnosed in 81.6% of patients with hyperphenylalaninaemia (HPA), non-PKU HPA in 17.2% and cofactor deficiency in 1.1%. From 1980, incidence of PKU has been stable: 1 per 17,124 live births. Sensitivity of the screening procedure was 99.3%. Age at diet initiation regularly decreased to reach 14 days as a median in 1996. Until 1990, median age at diet discontinuation was 6 years of age. Later, strict diet was continued longer (at least, up to 8-10 years). PKU patients who entered to secondary school at normal age were characterised by an earlier age at diagnosis and at diet initiation and a later age at diet discontinuation, compared to those who entered 1 year or more behind normal age. CONCLUSION:These data confirm the benefit of a nationwide organised screening program. They emphasise the importance of an early neonatal diagnosis and diet initiation in PKU patients and are consistent with the benefit of a longer period of strict diet in childhood."
8303613,"To describe the epidemiology of small intestinal atresia (SIA) in Atlanta, Georgia, from 1968 through 1989, we used the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program, an active, population-based surveillance system for birth defects diagnosed during the first year of life. We identified 176 infants with SIA, a prevalence of 2.8 per 10,000 livebirths. Among black infants, the prevalence was 3.7 per 10,000 livebirths, significantly higher than the prevalence of 2.4 per 10,000 among white infants [relative risk (RR) = 1.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.1,2.1]. Nine infants were each one member of a unique pair of twins. The prevalence among twin infants was 7.3 per 10,000, significantly higher than the prevalence of 2.8 per 10,000 among singletons (RR = 2.7, 95% CI = 1.4,5.2). Forty-nine percent of the infants had duodenal atresia, 36% had jejunal atresia, and 14% had ileal atresia. Two infants (1%) had atresia at an unspecified site in the small intestine. We grouped the infants by anatomic location of SIA into four categories: isolated SIA (53%), SIA with multiple unrelated defects (21%), sequences (16%), and syndromes (10%). We then compared the isolated and multiple unrelated defects groups by gender, race, maternal age, birth weight and one-year mortality for each location of SIA. Among black infants the prevalence of isolated jejunal atresia was 1.4 per 10,000, significantly higher than the prevalence of 0.2 per 10,000 among white infants (RR = 6.3, 95% CI = 2.9, 13.5). The increased prevalence of these defects among twins was a particularly interesting finding."
11851837,"BACKGROUND AND AIM:The prevalence of autoimmune hepatitis in Singapore is unknown. Over a period of 7 years, 24 cases were diagnosed in a district general hospital in Singapore (Toa Payoh Hospital) by using the scoring system proposed by the International Autoimmune Hepatitis Group in 1993. The aims of our study were to determine the prevalence of autoimmune hepatitis in Singapore, and to investigate the characteristics and prognosis in the mainly Chinese population. METHODS:The case records of all 24 patients were reviewed, and the following parameters were recorded: age at presentation, sex, symptoms and signs at presentation, past exposure to hepatotoxic drugs, alcohol intake, blood transfusion laboratory and histological tests used to determine autoimmune hepatitis, response to treatment, complications, and survival. RESULTS:The mean age of patients was 57 years old. There was a female-male ratio of 11:1. Forty-two percent of the patients were cirrhotic at presentation. The prevalence of autoimmune hepatitis was four per 100 000, with no significant difference between Chinese, Malay and Indian patients (Odds ratio of 0.38 by the chi-squared test). Eighty-nine percent of the patients responded to treatment with the induction of prednisolone, but the relapse rate was 61%. Treatment failure occurred in one patient. The mortality rate during the 7 years of follow up was 21%, and all were caused by complications of cirrhosis. The survival at 5 years was 71%, with a standard error of 0.13. CONCLUSION:Autoimmune hepatitis in Singapore is mainly a disease in older women. The response to steroid treatment is good, with a 5-year survival rate of 71%."
10789729,"Incidence rates of different cancers have been calculated for the population of Kyadondo County (Kampala, Uganda) for four time periods (1960-1966; 1967-1971; 1991-1994; 1995-1997), spanning 38 years in total. The period coincides with marked social and lifestyle changes and with the emergence of the AIDS epidemic. Most cancers have increased in incidence over time, the only exceptions being cancers of the bladder and penis. Apart from these, the most common cancers in the early years were cervix, oesophagus and liver; all three have remained common, with the first two showing quite marked increases in incidence, as have cancers of the breast and prostate. These changes have been overshadowed by the dramatic effects of the AIDS epidemic, with Kaposi's sarcoma emerging as the most common cancer in both sexes in the 1990s, and a large increase in incidence of squamous cell cancers of the conjunctiva. In the most recent period, there also seems to have been an increase in the incidence of non-Hodgkin lymphomas. So far, lung cancer remains rare. Cancer control in Uganda, as elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa, faces a threefold challenge. With little improvement in the incidence of cancers associated with infection and poverty (liver, cervix, oesophagus), it must face the burden of AIDS-associated cancers, while coping with the emergence of cancers associated with Westernization of lifestyles (large bowel, breast and prostate)."
11393497,"OBJECTIVES: To estimate the incidence of physician-diagnosed primary Sjögren syndrome (SS) among residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota, in the setting of usual medical care and to determine how often objective criteria are available in the medical records of such patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed all medical records of residents in Olmsted County with physician-diagnosed SS from 1976 to 1992 to determine whether they had undergone objective tests for keratoconjunctivitis sicca, salivary dysfunction, or serologic abnormality. Confounding illnesses were excluded. To identify misclassified cases, all records from patients with xerostomia or keratoconjunctivitis sicca were also reviewed. The average annual SS incidence rates were calculated by considering the entire population to be at risk. RESULTS: Of 75 patients with onset of SS during the study period, 53 had primary SS. All patients were white, 51 (96.2%) were women, and the mean +/- SD age was 59+/-15.8 years. The age- and sex-adjusted annual incidence was 3.9 per 100,000 population (95% confidence interval, 2.8-4.9) for patients with primary SS. Eleven patients (20.8%) with physician-diagnosed SS had no documentation of objective eye, mouth, or laboratory abnormalities. Objective evaluations performed most frequently were laboratory and ocular tests and least often were investigations of xerostomia. CONCLUSIONS: The average annual incidence rate for physician-diagnosed primary SS in Olmsted County is about 4 cases per 100,000 population. These data probably underestimate the true incidence because they are based on usual medical care of patients with SS in a community setting, rather than on a case-detection survey. In the future, a true incidence may be possible with a higher index of suspicion, greater attention to objective tests, and increased awareness of new classification criteria for SS. For epidemiological studies based on existing data, application of current criteria may not be feasible, and consensus on criteria for such studies would be useful."
16059942,"Schizencephaly is a rare congenital brain defect characterized by gray matter lined clefts of the cerebral mantle, frequently accompanied by other defects of the CNS such as absence of the corpus callosum. This study in a California population of >4 million births from 1985-2001 found a population prevalence of 1.54/100,000. Among 63 cases, there was an association with young parental age in isolated schizencephaly (RR 3.9 mothers; 5.8 fathers), which was also seen in mothers but not fathers of non-isolated cases (RR 3.2). Monozygotic twins may also be at increased risk for schizencephaly (RR 2.1). One third of cases had a non-CNS abnormality, over half of which could be classified as secondary to vascular disruption, including gastroschisis, bowel atresias, and amniotic band disruption sequence. Other apparent rare causes included chromosomal aneuploidy, non-random associations, and unusual syndromes. Our observations suggest that schizencephaly has heterogeneous etiologies many of which are vascular disruptive in origin."
17243053,"BACKGROUND: Listeriosis is a leading cause of death among patients with foodborne diseases in the United States. Monitoring disease incidence is an important element of listeriosis surveillance and control. METHOD: We conducted population-based surveillance for Listeria monocytogenes isolates obtained from normally sterile sites at all clinical diagnostic laboratories in the Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network from 1996 through 2003. RESULTS: The incidence of laboratory-confirmed invasive listeriosis decreased by 24% from 1996 through 2003; pregnancy-associated disease decreased by 37%, compared with a decrease of 23% for patients > or =50 years old. The highest incidence was reported among Hispanic persons from 1997 through 2001. Differences in incidence by age group and ethnicity may be explained by dietary preferences. CONCLUSION: The marked decrease in the incidence of listeriosis may be related to the decrease in the prevalence of L. monocytogenes contamination of ready-to-eat foods since 1996. The crude incidence in 2003 of 3.1 cases per 1 million population approaches the government's Healthy People objective of 2.5 cases per 1 million population by 2005. Further decreases in listeriosis incidence will require continued efforts of industry and government to reduce contamination of food and continued efforts to educate consumers and clinicians."
21997128,"While our understanding of the pathogenesis and management of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has improved over the past decade, estimates of its incidence have been controversial. The goal of this study was to examine ARDS incidence and outcome under current lung protective ventilatory support practices before and after the diagnosis of ARDS.This was a 1-year prospective, multicenter, observational study in 13 geographical areas of Spain (serving a population of 3.55 million at least 18 years of age) between November 2008 and October 2009. Subjects comprised all consecutive patients meeting American-European Consensus Criteria for ARDS. Data on ventilatory management, gas exchange, hemodynamics, and organ dysfunction were collected.A total of 255 mechanically ventilated patients fulfilled the ARDS definition, representing an incidence of 7.2/100,000 population/year. Pneumonia and sepsis were the most common causes of ARDS. At the time of meeting ARDS criteria, mean PaO(2)/FiO(2) was 114 ± 40 mmHg, mean tidal volume was 7.2 ± 1.1 ml/kg predicted body weight, mean plateau pressure was 26 ± 5 cmH(2)O, and mean positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) was 9.3 ± 2.4 cmH(2)O. Overall ARDS intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital mortality was 42.7% (95%CI 37.7-47.8) and 47.8% (95%CI 42.8-53.0), respectively.This is the first study to prospectively estimate the ARDS incidence during the routine application of lung protective ventilation. Our findings support previous estimates in Europe and are an order of magnitude lower than those reported in the USA and Australia. Despite use of lung protective ventilation, overall ICU and hospital mortality of ARDS patients is still higher than 40%."
24655069,"CONCLUSION: Vestibular schwannomas (VSs) are diagnosed less frequently in the remote parts of Denmark, whereas the diagnostic age and tumor size is the same across the different socio-demographic areas of Denmark. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether VSs are diagnosed equally often in different socio-demographic areas of Denmark and whether a change has occurred during the period 1976-2012. In addition, differences in diagnostic age and tumor size between areas were explored. METHODS: Since 1976, all patients diagnosed with a VS in Denmark have been registered in a national database, in which information on, for example, the size of the tumor and the age and address of the patient has been registered. Up to 2012, 2739 patients were diagnosed with a VS. Patient distribution according to area of habitat was determined by subgrouping into urban, suburban, rural, and remote municipalities, using the definitions of socio-demographic areas elaborated by Demarks Statistic. RESULTS: The mean national incidence increased almost linearly over the time period from 6.1 per million per year in the first period from 1976 to 1984, to 22.1 per million per year in the last period from 2003 to 2012. There was a lower incidence at the end of the period in the remote areas compared with the other socio-demographic areas (1976-1984, p = 0.05 and 2003-2011, p = 0.001). The mean age at diagnosis increased during the period, from 52.6 years in the first period to 58.6 years in the last period. There was no significant difference in the age distribution between socio- demographic areas. The mean diagnostic tumor size decreased during the period, from 28.6 mm in the first period to about 10 mm in the last period. There was no significant difference in the size of the tumor between socio- demographic areas."
23609960,"IMPORTANCE: Epidemiological data on hereditary cerebellar ataxia (HCA) and hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) are scarce. OBJECTIVE: To present the prevalence and distribution of HCA and HSP in Portugal. DESIGN AND SETTING: Population-based, nationwide, systematic survey, from January 1, 1994, through April 15, 2004, in Portugal. PARTICIPANTS: Multiple sources of information were used (review of clinical files, active collaboration of neurologists and geneticists, and investigation of affected families), but the main source was active collaboration of general practitioners. Patients were examined by the same team of neurologists, using homogeneous inclusion criteria. The clinical data were registered, and all families were genetically tested. RESULTS: Overall, 1336 patients from a population of 10,322 million were diagnosed as having HCA or HSP, a prevalence of 12.9 per 100,000 population. Hereditary cerebellar ataxia was more prevalent (prevalence, 8.9 per 100,000 population; 5.6 for dominant and 3.3 for recessive ataxias) than HSP (prevalence, 4.1 per 100,000 population; 2.4 for dominant and 1.6 for recessive). Machado-Joseph disease (spinocerebellar ataxia type 3) (prevalence, 3.1 per 100,000 population), Friedreich ataxia (prevalence, 1.0 per 100,000 population), and ataxia with oculomotor apraxia (prevalence, 0.4 per 100,000 population) were the most frequent HCAs. Spastic paraplegia types 4 (prevalence, 0.91 per 100,000 population), 3 (prevalence, 0.14 per 100,000 population), and 11 (prevalence, 0.26 per 100,000 population) were the most prevalent HSPs. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This population-based survey covered all the Portuguese territory and mobilized most general practitioners and health centers. To our best knowledge, this survey was the largest ever performed for HCA and HSP. Prevalence of autosomal dominant ataxias was high, particularly for Machado-Joseph disease (spinocerebellar ataxia type 3). The genetic cause has not been identified in 39.7% of the patients studied."
9165461,"The incidence of Hirschsprung's disease (HD) was studied retrospectively in Oman using hospital-based data. In Oman there is a single pediatric surgery unit where a register has been kept from 1989 to 1994, and because all cases are referred to this unit, a national survey could be carried out. There were 85 children with HD born between 1989 and 1994, and during the period there were 261,000 livebirths among Omani nationals. The population frequency in Oman is 1 in 3,070 (0.3/1,000). Eighty percent of cases presented in the first 6 months. The incidence in different regions and within different tribes of Oman was also studied. The highest frequency (1 in 1,800) is in the North Sharqiya region. There was not a significant seasonal influence in spite of the very high temperatures seen in the desert summer. The ratio of male to female cases was 2.9:1 overall, but less for longer-segment involvement. The consanguinity rate (first and second cousins) was 75%, which is higher than the level of consanguinity in the Omani population. Down's syndrome was observed in nine cases (11%), and a variety of other malformations were seen, including piebaldism, deafness, and HD in two sibships."
15239394,"The first case of porphyria on record in Japan was a patient with congenital erythropoietic porphyria (CEP) reported by Sato and Takahashi in 1920. Since then until the end of December 2002, 827 cases of porphyrias have been diagnosed from characteristic clinical and/or laboratory findings (463 males, 358 females, and 6 of unknown sex). Essentially all inherited porphyrias have been found in Japan, with the incidences and clinical symptoms generally being similar to those reported for other countries. The male-female ratio was approximately 1:1 for CEP, whereas it was higher for erythropoietic protoporphyria. In contrast, preponderances of female patients exist with acute hepatic porphyrias, such as acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), variegate porphyria (VP), and hereditary coproporphyria (HCP), and with undefined acute porphyria. Although porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) is believed to be increasing recently in women in other countries because of smoking and the use of contraceptives, it is still by far more prominent in males in Japan than in females. The recent increasing contribution of hepatitis C virus infection to PCT in Japan has also been recognized. but there have been no PCT cases in Japan with HFE gene mutations. Familial occurrence and consanguinity were high for CEP, as expected; however, significant consanguinity was also noted in families where CEP, AIP, HCP, VP, or PCT occurred as a single isolated case without a family history of disease. This survey also revealed that as many as 71% of acute hepatic porphyria cases were initially diagnosed as nonporphyria and later revised or corrected to porphyria, indicating the difficulty of diagnosing porphyria in the absence of specific laboratory testing for porphyrins and their precursors in urine, stool, plasma, and erythrocyte samples."
17959635,"The present study was designed to identify recent clinical phenotypes using the National Epidemiological Survey and to compare findings with those of previous surveys in Japan. Pathologically confirmed sarcoidosis cases newly diagnosed in 2004 were eligible for the present study. Disease parameters were recorded and compared. A total of 1,027 patients were enrolled from a cluster encompassing 79.4% of the entire Japanese population. The study participants consisted of 364 males and 663 females, providing an average incidence rate of 1.01 per 100,000 inhabitants (0.73 for males and 1.28 for females). The age-specific incidence rate displayed a biphasic pattern in the whole patient population and in the females. The male incidence rates peaked in the 20-34-yr-old group. A second peak for 50-60-yr-old females showed a higher incidence than the first younger peak. Patients with abnormalities in eyes, skin and cardiac laboratory findings accounted for 54.8, 35.4 and 23.0% of cases, respectively. The female/male incidence ratio was increased, and the frequency of eye and skin involvement and cardiac abnormality was higher than in previous surveys conducted in Japan. In conclusion, the data obtained in the present study differ from those of other countries and showed changes in sarcoidosis clinical phenotypes compared with previous studies in Japan."
22414599,"Retinoblastoma is an aggressive eye cancer of infancy and childhood. Survival and the chance of saving vision depend on severity of disease at presentation. Retinoblastoma was the first tumour to draw attention to the genetic aetiology of cancer. Despite good understanding of its aetiology, mortality from retinoblastoma is about 70% in countries of low and middle income, where most affected children live. Poor public and medical awareness, and an absence of rigorous clinical trials to assess innovative treatments impede progress. Worldwide, most of the estimated 9000 newly diagnosed patients every year will die. However, global digital communications present opportunities to optimise standards of care for children and families affected by this rare and often devastating cancer. Parents are now leading the effort for widespread awareness of the danger of leucocoria. Genome-level technologies could make genetic testing a reality for every family affected by retinoblastoma. Best-practice guidelines, online sharing of pathological images, point-of-care data entry, multidisciplinary research, and clinical trials can reduce mortality. Most importantly, active participation of survivors and families will ensure that the whole wellbeing of the child is prioritised in any treatment plan."
6486168,"Estimates of the incidence of the Meckel syndrome (MS) from different parts of the world vary from 1:140,000 to 1:13,250 births. In this nationwide study performed in Finland, the incidence of 1:14,400 births was found by retrospective ascertainment during the period 1970-1979, while the incidence was 1:8,500 births when prospective monitoring was performed in 1980-1981. The most probable incidence in Finland is about 1:9,000 births. Autosomal recessive inheritance of MS is confirmed in this study. The ratio of affected sibs, corrected for truncate complete ascertainment, was 0.261. No consanguinity between parents was found, as marriages between close relatives are rare in Finland and the ancestors were not traced back far enough to find remote consanguinities."
2575263,"The reported incidence of gastrointestinal endocrine tumours is variable. In Northern Ireland circumstances allowing such an assessment are favourable with a central diagnostic laboratory and register established to collect data on tumours from a well-defined population of 1.5 million people. From 1970 to 1985, 368 cases were recorded of which 85 per cent were carcinoid tumours. The annual incidence of carcinoid tumours was 1.3 per 100,000 of the population and the majority occurred in the appendix (61 per cent). No patients presented with the carcinoid syndrome. The annual incidence for other tumours was 0.12 per 100,000 for insulinomas; islet cell tumours of unknown type 0.07; Zollinger-Ellison syndrome 0.05; and multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 0.05. There were two cases of VIPoma, one glucagonoma, one neurotensinoma and one tumour producing ACTH. It is possible that some tumours are more uncommon than others because of difficulty in diagnosis."
30242075,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:Congenital hypothyroidism (CHT) is one of the most common preventable causes of learning disability. Newborn screening with whole-blood thyroid-stimulating hormone measurements was introduced in the Republic of Ireland in 1979 and is coordinated from a single center with an unchanged protocol since its inception. Our objective in this study was to describe the incidence of CHT in the Republic of Ireland over the past 37 years in the context of a complete national population and an unchanged screening protocol. METHODS:The newborn screening records of all individuals who were diagnosed with CHT between 1979 and 2016 were reviewed. Infants with positive screening results had a whole-blood thyroid-stimulating hormone value of ≥15 mU/L at 72 to 120 hours of life; values of 8 to 15 mU/L required a repeat whole-blood screening test. RESULTS:Of 2 361 174 infants who were screened between July 1979 and December 2016, 1063 (662 girls) were diagnosed with CHT (incidence: 0.45 cases per 1000 live births). The number of detected cases increased from 0.27 cases per 1000 live births treated between 1979 and 1991 to 0.41 cases per 1000 live births treated between 1992 and 2004 to 0.65 cases per 1000 live births treated between 2005 and 2016. The increase in detected cases of CHT was predominantly in the normal or hyperplastic gland category. CONCLUSIONS:The incidence of CHT has increased significantly in the Republic of Ireland over the past 37 years despite a consistent screening cutoff. The increased rate was not explained by an increased survival rate of preterm infants or a changing population heterogeneity."
16435194,"In order to estimate the cumulative incidence rates of the mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) in Germany, a retrospective epidemiological survey covering the period between 1980 and 1995 was implemented. Multiple ascertainment sources were used to identify affected patients. A prevalence of approximately 0.69 cases per 100,000 births was obtained for MPS I (Hurler phenotype). Within the study period, 4 patients with Hurler/Scheie phenotype and 7 cases with Scheie disease were detected. The cumulative incidence for MPS II (Hunter syndrome) was estimated as 0.64 cases per 100,000 births (1.3 cases per 100,000 male live births); that for MPS III (Sanfilippo syndrome types A, B and C) as 1.57 cases in 100,000 births; that for MPS IV A (Morquio syndrome) as 0.38 cases in 100,000; and that for MPS VI (Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome) as 0.23 cases per 100,000 births. Two cases of MPS IVB (beta-galactosidase deficiency) have been identified, but no patients with MPS VII or MPS IX. A relatively high number of patients with MPS IIIB, MPS IVA and MPS VI were of Turkish origin. The crude rate for all types of mucopolysaccharidoses is approximately 3.53 cases in 100,000 live births. The cumulative incidence pattern of MPS in Germany was compared with the corresponding rates among other industrial nations obtained from recent literature: the crude cumulative rates for all types of mucopolysaccharidoses (3.4-4.5 in 100,000 live births) were similar among all published populations; however, different frequencies of the various forms of MPS were observed."
22692795,"Huntington's disease (HD) is a rare, neurodegenerative disorder characterized by chorea, behavioral manifestations, and dementia. The aim of this study was to estimate the incidence and prevalence of HD through a systematic review of the literature. Medline and Embase databases were searched using terms specific to HD as well as studies of incidence, prevalence, and epidemiology. All studies reporting the incidence and/or prevalence of HD were included. Twenty original research articles were included. Eight studies examined incidence, and 17 studies examined prevalence. Meta-analysis of data from four incidence studies revealed an incidence of 0.38 per 100,000 per year (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.16, 0.94). Lower incidence was reported in the Asian studies (n = 2), compared to the studies performed in Europe, North America, and Australia (n = 6). The worldwide service-based prevalence of HD, based on a meta-analysis (n = 13 studies), was 2.71 per 100,000 (95% CI: 1.55-4.72). Eleven studies were conducted in Europe, North American, and Australia, with an overall prevalence of 5.70 per 100,000 (95% CI: 4.42-7.35). Three studies were conducted in Asia, with an overall prevalence of 0.40 per 100,000 (95% CI: 0.26-0.61). Metaregression revealed a significantly lower prevalence of HD in Asia, compared to European, North American, and Australian populations. HD is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder with a higher prevalence in Europe, North America, and Australia than in Asia. The difference in prevalence of this genetic disorder can be largely explained by huntingtin gene haplotypes."
15648083,"BACKGROUND: Recent breakthroughs regarding gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) and their pathogenesis have redefined diagnostic criteria and have led to the development of molecularly targeted drug therapy. New treatment options mandate more accurate information regarding the incidence, prevalence, clinical behavior, and prognostic factors of GIST. METHODS: All patients (n=1460) who potentially had GIST diagnosed from 1983 to 2000 in western Sweden (population, 1.3-1.6 million) were reviewed, and 288 patients with primary GIST were identified. The incidence and prevalence of GIST were determined, and predictive prognostic factors, including current risk-group stratifications, were analyzed statistically. RESULTS: Ninety percent of GISTs were detected clinically due to symptoms (69%) or were incidental findings at surgery (21%); the remaining 10% of GISTs were found at autopsy. Forty-four percent of symptomatic, clinically detected GISTs were categorized as high risk (29%) or overtly malignant (15%), with tumor-related deaths occurring in 63% of patients and 83% of patients, respectively (estimated median survival, of 40 months and 16 months, respectively). Tumor-related deaths occurred in only 2 of 170 of patients (1.2%) with very-low-risk, low-risk, or intermediate-risk tumors. The annual incidence of GIST was 14.5 per million. The prevalence of all GIST risk groups was 129 per million (31 per million for the high-risk group and the overtly malignant group). CONCLUSIONS: GIST has been under recognized: Its incidence, prevalence, and clinical aggressiveness also have been underestimated. Currently existing risk-group stratification systems based on tumor size and mitotic rate delineate GIST patients who have a poor prognosis. Prognostication in patients with GIST can be refined using a proposed risk score based solely on tumor size and proliferative index."
23758768,"The G6PC3 gene encodes the ubiquitously expressed glucose-6-phosphatase enzyme (G-6-Pase β or G-6-Pase 3 or G6PC3). Bi-allelic G6PC3 mutations cause a multi-system autosomal recessive disorder of G6PC3 deficiency (also called severe congenital neutropenia type 4, MIM 612541). To date, at least 57 patients with G6PC3 deficiency have been described in the literature.G6PC3 deficiency is characterized by severe congenital neutropenia, recurrent bacterial infections, intermittent thrombocytopenia in many patients, a prominent superficial venous pattern and a high incidence of congenital cardiac defects and uro-genital anomalies. The phenotypic spectrum of the condition is wide and includes rare manifestations such as maturation arrest of the myeloid lineage, a normocellular bone marrow, myelokathexis, lymphopaenia, thymic hypoplasia, inflammatory bowel disease, primary pulmonary hypertension, endocrine abnormalities, growth retardation, minor facial dysmorphism, skeletal and integument anomalies amongst others. Dursun syndrome is part of this extended spectrum. G6PC3 deficiency can also result in isolated non-syndromic severe neutropenia. G6PC3 mutations in result in reduced enzyme activity, endoplasmic reticulum stress response, increased rates of apoptosis of affected cells and dysfunction of neutrophil activity.In this review we demonstrate that loss of function in missense G6PC3 mutations likely results from decreased enzyme stability. The condition can be diagnosed by sequencing the G6PC3 gene. A number of G6PC3 founder mutations are known in various populations and a possible genotype-phenotype relationship also exists. G6PC3 deficiency should be considered as part of the differential diagnoses in any patient with unexplained congenital neutropenia.Treatment with G-CSF leads to improvement in neutrophil numbers, prevents infections and improves quality of life. Mildly affected patients can be managed with prophylactic antibiotics. Untreated G6PC3 deficiency can be fatal. Echocardiogram, renal and pelvic ultrasound scans should be performed in all cases of suspected or confirmed G6PC3 deficiency. Routine assessment should include biochemical profile, growth profile and monitoring for development of varicose veins or venous ulcers."
9713119,"INTRODUCTION:Biotinidase deficiency is an inheritable disorder of biotin metabolism. This disorder fulfills major criteria for consideration for newborn screening: the affected children do no show clinical signs in the newborn period; the disease is highly disabling; treatment is effective in preventing neurological sequelae if undertaken promptly. MATERIAL AND METHODS:Screening of 125,000 infants born in Paraná State was carried out to establish the prevalence of biotinidase deficiency. A simple colorimetric procedure was used to detect two infants with biotinidase deficiency (1:62,500), one of them with profound deficiency (1:125,000) and the other with partial deficiency (1:125,000) of the enzyme. RESULTS:There were no known false-negative test results and 0.12% were false-positive, defined by further blood samples which were negative upon repeated testing. Sensitivity was 100% and specificity was 99.88%. Repeat blood samples could not be obtained in 63 (30%) suspected cases. CONCLUSIONS:Newborn screening for biotinidase is useful in identifying affected children, is inexpensive and allows early intervention, which may prevent irreversible neurological damage."
22790125,"BACKGROUND: Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) are rarely encountered in clinical practice. The prevalence of PAVMs associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) has been estimated based on the rate in the family members of HHT patients, but the prevalence of PAVMs in the general population remains unknown. METHODS: We retrospectively examined the prevalence and clinical characteristics of PAVMs as detected by a low-dose thoracic CT screening program for lung cancer at the Hitachi Medical Center and the Hitachi General Health Care Center in the northern part of Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan. RESULTS: From 2001 to 2007, we identified eight patients (seven females and one male) with PAVMs among 21,235 initial screening participants (the mean age of the patients with PAVMs and that of the screening participants was 60.6 years). The prevalence of PAVMs was estimated at 38 per 100,000 individuals [95% confidence interval (CI)=18-76]. The diameter of the PAVMs was a mean of 6.6 mm, and none of the lesions could be detected by chest X-ray. Females older than 60 years tended to have larger PAVMs than younger women did (p=0.06). Two patients (25%) were diagnosed with HHT. One patient had previously undergone surgery for a brain abscess. CONCLUSION: PAVMs are more prevalent than previously reported, especially among females."
10692058,"BACKGROUND:Pemphigus is a disease showing an uneven geographical distribution. In Bulgaria pemphigus has always represented a substantial part of diagnosed bullous diseases, but previous epidemiological data are incomplete. Our purpose was to evaluate retrospectively the incidence and prevalence of pemphigus in the district of Sofia (the capital of Bulgaria; population 1 200 000) for a sixteen-year period. METHODS:The files of all the newly registered patients with pemphigus in the City Hospital of Dermatology in Sofia during the period Jan 1 1980 to Dec 31 1995, were collected and analysed with regard to personal statistics, ethnic origin, profession, history of the disease including age and season of onset, symptoms, clinical diagnosis, severity, laboratory findings, associated illnesses, therapy, and cure rate. Special attention was paid to smoking, alcohol abuse, and the presence of triggering factors such as emotional stress, drug intake, underlying diseases, neoplasias, or others. RESULTS:During the 16-year period studied, 74 newly diagnosed cases of pemphigus occurred in the district of Sofia, giving a prevalence of 0.38 per 100 000 inhabitants and a mean incidence of 0.47/100 000/year for the overall population and 0.51/100 000/year for the population aged above 20 years. The most common clinical variant is pemphigus vulgaris, frequently occurring in the fifth-sixth decades. The vast majority of the patients are workers or professionals. CONCLUSIONS:The results of the present retrospective study reveal a relatively high prevalence and incidence of pemphigus in Bulgaria, compared to that encountered in other countries. Our data is similar to that reported from Greece. Whether the Balkan Peninsula represents a focus of population groups with high susceptibility to pemphigus is a problem which could be highlighted by further epidemiological studies in this geographic area."
22337075,"STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective observational study utilizing prospectively collected population-based data. OBJECTIVE: To describe the epidemiology and demographics of all patients with traumatic spinal cord injury (TSCI) treated at a single institution, which represents the sole referral center and specialized SCI unit for a population of 4 million people. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Although many studies report on the epidemiology of TSCI, studies in which patients are prospectively characterized in the acute setting with precise recording of their baseline neurological impairment are uncommon. METHODS: Data on all patients admitted to a level 1 trauma center with TSCI between 1995 and 2004 were prospectively collected using a customized, fully relational, locally designed, spine database. RESULTS: The incidence of TSCI averaged 35.7 per million and did not change substantially during 10 years of data collection. However, the median age of TSCI patients increased from 34.5 to 45.5 years during this period. The men-to-women ratio was 4.4:1. In those older than 55 years, cervical-level injuries with incomplete American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Impairment Scale (AIS) scores C and D were most common, with men demonstrating predominantly lower cervical injuries and women more likely to exhibit upper cervical injuries. Increasing rates of surgical treatment during 10 years of this study (61.8%-86.4%) were not associated with improvements in mortality rate or length of hospital stay. Patients older than 75 years who presented with an acute TSCI had a mortality rate of 20% while in hospital. CONCLUSION: The incidence of TSCI in our population has remained remarkably stable, and age-related changes mirror those in the population across 10 years. An increased tendency to surgical treatment during the 10 years of this study has not resulted in concomitant changes in patients' in-hospital mortality or length of stay."
17286306,"Adequate contemporary information to counsel patients with a prenatal diagnosis of holoprosencephaly is lacking. We addressed this using data from the West Midlands Congenital Anomaly Register (WMCAR), a population-based malformation register, during a time where technological improvements have been stable and anomaly screening is well established.Cases were defined using the ICD 10 code for holoprosencephaly. Cases of livebirths, stillbirths and termination at all gestations were included in the study. The diagnosis was verified by a pathology or definitive radiological report with cross validation from the regional pathology, clinical genetics, cytogenetics and fetal medicine databases.There were 113 cases reported of holoprosencephaly for the years 1995-2004. This represents a prevalence of 1.7 per 10,000 births and terminations, with no change in prevalence over time. There was a decreased risk of holoprosencephaly in the white population [white vs. nonwhite; RR 0.53(0.36-0.79)]. Karyotypical abnormality was noted in 46% of cases where the karyotype was known. Trisomy 13 was the most common chromosomal abnormality. Correct allocation of a diagnosis of holoprosencephaly by ultrasound occurred in 77% of cases, with another 12% having a severe intracranial abnormality but was not reported as holoprosencephaly. In 4%, a prenatal diagnosis of holoprosencephaly was not made. Termination of pregnancy was performed in 80% of all cases.Holoprosencephaly is a morbid condition associated with significant secondary etiologies."
21953423,"Until early 2000, permanent and transient neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM), defined as diabetes with onset within 6 weeks from birth that requires insulin therapy for at least 2 weeks, were considered exceedingly rare conditions, with a global incidence of 1:500,000-1:400,000 live births. The new definition of NDM recently adopted, that includes patients with diabetes onset within 6 months of age, has prompted studies that have set the incidence of the permanent form alone between 1:210,000 and 1:260,000 live births. Aim of the present work was to ascertain the incidence of NDM (i.e. permanent + transient form) in Italy for years 2005-2010. Patients referred to the Italian reference laboratory for NDM between years 2005 and 2010 and screened for mutations in common NDM genes (KCNJ11, ABCC8, and INS) and for uniparental isodisomy of chromosome 6 (UDP6) were reviewed. A questionnaire aimed at identifying NDM cases investigated in other laboratories was sent to 54 Italian reference centers for pediatric diabetes. Twenty-seven patients with NDM born between 2005 and 2010 were referred to the reference laboratory. In this group, a mutation of either KCNJ11, ABCC8 or INS was found in 18 patients, and a case with UDP6 was identified. Questionnaires revealed 4 additional cases with transient neonatal diabetes due to UDP6. Incidence of NDM was calculated at 1:90,000 (CI: 1:63,000-1:132,000) live births. Thus, with the definition currently in use, about 6 new cases with NDM are expected to be born in Italy each year."
20490927,"The aim of this retrospective study was to determine the prevalence of lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) in the Czech Republic. The data on cases diagnosed between 1975 and 2008 were collected and analyzed. The overall prevalence of LSDs in the Czech population (12.25 per 100,000) is comparable to that reported for the countries with well-established and advanced diagnostics of LSDs such as the Netherlands (14 per 100,000), Australia (12.9 per 100,000) and Italy (12.1 per 100,000). Relatively higher prevalence of LSDs was reported in the north of Portugal (25 per 100,000). Thirty-four different LSDs were diagnosed in a total of 478 individuals. Gaucher disease was the most frequent LSD with a birth prevalence of 1.13 per 100,000 births. The most frequent LSD groups were lipidoses, mucopolysaccharidoses, and neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses, with combined prevalences of 5.0, 3.72, and 2.29 per 100,000 live births, respectively. Glycoproteinoses (0.57 per 100,000 live births), glycogenosis type II (0.37), and mucolipidoses (0.31) rarely occur in the Czech population, and a range of other LSDs have not been detected at all over the past three decades. Knowledge of the birth prevalence and carrier frequency of particular disorders is important in genetic counselling for calculation of the risk for the disorder in the other members of affected families. Earlier diagnosis of these disorders will permit timely intervention and may also result in lowering of the number of newborns with LSDs."
17873609,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is characterized by the autoimmune inflammatory response of small intrahepatic bile ducts. Prevalence in Spain is estimated as 61.9 cases per million inhabitants, whereas Northern Europe rates over 200 cases/million. Our objective was to determine the incidence and prevalence of PBC in our health area. MATERIAL AND METHODS: PBC was defined by the presence of abnormal liver tests (dissociated cholestasis) with positive antimitochondrial antibodies and/or compatible liver histology. Medical records from patients diagnosed between 1990 and 2002 were reviewed retrospectively. The following data were collected: diagnostic data, demographic and analytic data, liver histology and stage and treatment and disease outcome. RESULTS: In a population of 389 758 inhabitants, 87 patients were diagnosed with PBC. Mean age at diagnosis was 63.9+/-12.6 years. Eighty-four (96.6%) were women. Mean annual incidence was 17.2 per 10 inhabitants and the prevalence at the end of study was 195 per 10. Biopsy was performed in 71 (81.6%) patients, 61 of whom (86%) did not have fibrosis. Time of follow-up was 63.6+/-43.2 (2.28-153.9) months. CONCLUSION: Incidence and prevalence in our reference area are higher than in some Spanish areas, as per the results previously published; however, they are comparable with those obtained in Northern Europe and the US."
19124490,"OBJECTIVE:The objective of this analysis was to describe the distribution of pelvic carcinomas in the United States by demographic, pathologic, and clinical features. METHODS:Carcinomas of the ovary (n = 112,541), peritoneum (n = 6,458), and fallopian tube (n = 3,479) were identified through 24 population-based registries in the United States during the period 1995 to 2004. Age-adjusted incidence rates were calculated per million population using counts derived from the 2000 U.S. census. RESULTS:The age-adjusted incidence rate for ovarian carcinoma (119.9 per million) was substantially higher than for peritoneal (6.78 per million) or fallopian tube (3.72 per million) carcinomas. White women had the highest rates for all three malignancies. Rates for peritoneal carcinoma were lowest among Black women (2.88 per million) and rates for fallopian tube carcinoma were lowest among Hispanic women (2.45 per million). Serous carcinomas were the most commonly diagnosed histologic type for all anatomic sites. Peritoneal carcinomas were diagnosed at later ages (mean, 67 years) and more advanced stages (85% regional/distant) compared with fallopian tube carcinomas (mean, 64 years; 62% regional/distant) and ovarian carcinomas (mean, 63 years; 76% regional/distant). Incidence for all three pelvic carcinomas was lowest in the South. Time trend analyses between 1973 and 2005 exhibited a significant decline in ovarian carcinoma incidence and rises in the rates of peritoneal and fallopian tube cancers. CONCLUSIONS:Similarities in the incidence patterns for ovarian, peritoneal, and fallopian tube carcinomas support the likelihood of a common molecular pathogenesis."
18609163,"OBJECTIVE: Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a chronic liver disease, which if untreated can lead to cirrhosis and hepatic failure. The aim of the study was to investigate the incidence, prevalence, diagnostic tradition and clinical initial presentation of AIH. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Analyses were performed in 473 patients identified as having probable or definite AIH. RESULTS: The incidence of AIH was 0.85/100,000 (95% CI 0.69-1.01) inhabitants, which is somewhat lower than reported previously. The point prevalence amounted to 10.7/100,000 (95% CI 8.8-13.1), and 76% of the cases were females. The age-related incidence curve was bimodal but men were found to have only one incidence peak in the late teens, whereas women had a peak after menopause. AIH was presented as a spectrum of clinical settings from detected ""en passant"" to acute liver failure. Almost 30% of patients already had liver cirrhosis at diagnosis. Autoantibodies indicative of AIH type 1 were found in 79% of cases. Other concomitant autoimmune diseases were frequently found (49%). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence and prevalence figures confirm that AIH is a fairly uncommon disease in the Swedish population. Symptoms at presentation were unspecific, but almost half of the patients were jaundiced, with around 30% having liver cirrhosis. The majority of Swedish AIH patients had AIH type 1."
16839424,"Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a heart muscle disease characterized by ventricular dilatation and impaired systolic function. Patients with DCM suffer from heart failure, arrhythmia, and are at risk of premature death. DCM has a prevalence of one case out of 2500 individuals with an incidence of 7/100,000/year (but may be under diagnosed). In many cases the disease is inherited and is termed familial DCM (FDC). FDC may account for 20-48% of DCM. FDC is principally caused by genetic mutations in FDC genes that encode for cytoskeletal and sarcomeric proteins in the cardiac myocyte. Family history analysis is an important tool for identifying families affected by FDC. Standard criteria for evaluating FDC families have been published and the use of such criteria is increasing. Clinical genetic testing has been developed for some FDC genes and will be increasingly utilized for evaluating FDC families. Through the use of family screening by pedigree analysis and/or genetic testing, it is possible to identify patients at earlier, or even presymptomatic stages of their disease. This presents an opportunity to invoke lifestyle changes and to provide pharmacological therapy earlier in the course of disease. Genetic counseling is used to identify additional asymptomatic family members who are at risk of developing symptoms, allowing for regular screening of these individuals. The management of FDC focuses on limiting the progression of heart failure and controlling arrhythmia, and is based on currently accepted treatment guidelines for DCM. It includes general measures (salt and fluid restriction, treatment of hypertension, limitation of alcohol intake, control of body weight, moderate exercise) and pharmacotherapy. Cardiac resynchronization, implantable cardioverter defibrillators and left ventricular assist devices have progressively expanding usage. Patients with severe heart failure, severe reduction of the functional capacity and depressed left ventricular ejection fraction have a low survival rate and may require heart transplant."
1137336,"Almost all the patients (95 women and 8 men) with interstitial cystitis, i.e. autoimmune cystitis, in this area with a population of about 970,000 were probably traced. The prevalence of the disease in the female members of this population was 18.1 cases per 100,000 women of all ages. The joint prevalence of both sexes together was 10.6 cases per 100,000. The annual incidence of new female cases was 1.2 per 100,000 women. The disease is not rare when mild and moderately severe cases are also diagnosed. Severe cases account for only a tenth of all cases. Only about a tenth of the patients are men and most of them had the mild form of the disease. It may begin at any age. The incidence has possibly been rising during the last 10 years. Interstitial cystitis does not as a rule progress continuously but reaches its final stage rapidly, then usually remains in the same category. With this prevalence and incidence every urologist in this area can expect to see at least one case a year."
2350888,"The incidence rate of laryngeal papillomas in a Danish subpopulation (approximately 2.8 million inhabitants) was 3.84 x 10(-6) per year in the period 1968-1984. For juvenile papillomas the incidence rate was 3.62 x 10(-6), compared with 3.94 x 10(-6) for laryngeal papillomas of adult onset. When comparing different time periods a significantly low incidence was found in the time 1965-1968, while the incidence remained constant in 1969-1984. The low incidence rate in the early period may be real, but selectional bias may have played a part. It is general anticipated that maternal genital HPV-infections may serve as an HPV-reservoir, and that juvenile laryngeal papillomas is a result of HPV transmission from the mother to the child during birth. In the period in question cervical HPV-infections have been recorded with increasing frequency in younger women, indicating that the prevalence is rising. However, this is not reflected in the incidence of laryngeal papillomas."
17028542,"Unverricht-Lundborg disease (ULD) is the purest and least severe type of progressive myoclonus epilepsy (PME), and is not associated with progressive cognitive deficit. Symptoms stabilize in adulthood, with a varying degree of permanent, often severe handicap that is mostly due to myoclonus. The disorder follows an autosomal recessive transmission pattern, with onset between 8 and 15 years years of age of generalized tonic-clonic or clonic-tonic-clonic seizures, action myoclonus (massive or segmental), photosensitivity, and often ataxia. Prevalence varies, it is highest in certain isolates (Finland, La Réunion Island) and in region with higher levels of inbreeding (Maghreb). ULD is due to a deficit in cystatin B (stefin B), but the mechanisms leading to the clinical symptoms are not well understood. The causative gene, PME1, was identified in 1991 and localized to chromosome 21q22.3. The mutations are mainly expansions of the CCCCGCCCCGCG dodecamer, but less common point mutations were also found. A variant has been recently reported in a Palestinian family, with localization on chromosome 12. The diagnosis of ULD is made on the basis of family history, age at onset, geographical and ethnic context, and on the typical features of myoclonus and epilepsy, in the absence of cognitive and sensory deficits. Neurophysiological evaluation yields interesting, but unspecific results. There are no biological or pathological markers for ULD. Molecular analysis confirms the diagnosis in most patients. Genetic testing for heterozygotes and even prenatal diagnosis are possible, although seldom performed, if the mutation has been identified. In spite of intensive research, ULD has yet to reveal all of its secrets. It remains a quasi ""idiopathic"" type of PME, with limited progression. Clinicians and patients are still waiting for an etiologically oriented treatment, which should, ideally, be admnistered early in the course of the disease, if possible before the onset of invalidating symptoms."
7898602,"Epidemiological studies performed directly on the population show a prevalence of Friedreich's ataxia (FA) from 1 to 4.7 cases/100,000 inhabitants. An indirect epidemiological approach can be achieved using genetic methods like consanguinity studies to determine the frequency of a mutated gene and the incidence of certain diseases in the population. We obtained consanguinity data of a series of FA patients in Valencia, Spain and the figures on consanguinity in the general population that were estimated according to the Archive of Dispensations given by the Catholic church for consanguineous marriages. From these data, the frequency of the FA gene was calculated as 1/127. From these data, applying the Hardy-Weinberg principle, the frequency of the carriers was 1/64 and the incidence was 6.18/100,000 live births. Assuming a life expectancy of FA of 45 years, the prevalence was 3.83/100,000 inhabitants. These figures are in the same range as those obtained in population studies."
22078432,"Congenital heart disease (CHD) accounts for nearly one-third of all major congenital anomalies. CHD birth prevalence worldwide and over time is suggested to vary; however, a complete overview is missing. This systematic review included 114 papers, comprising a total study population of 24,091,867 live births with CHD identified in 164,396 individuals. Birth prevalence of total CHD and the 8 most common subtypes were pooled in 5-year time periods since 1930 and in continent and income groups since 1970 using the inverse variance method. Reported total CHD birth prevalence increased substantially over time, from 0.6 per 1,000 live births (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.4 to 0.8) in 1930 to 1934 to 9.1 per 1,000 live births (95% CI: 9.0 to 9.2) after 1995. Over the last 15 years, stabilization occurred, corresponding to 1.35 million newborns with CHD every year. Significant geographical differences were found. Asia reported the highest CHD birth prevalence, with 9.3 per 1,000 live births (95% CI: 8.9 to 9.7), with relatively more pulmonary outflow obstructions and fewer left ventricular outflow tract obstructions. Reported total CHD birth prevalence in Europe was significantly higher than in North America (8.2 per 1,000 live births [95% CI: 8.1 to 8.3] vs. 6.9 per 1,000 live births [95% CI: 6.7 to 7.1]; p < 0.001). Access to health care is still limited in many parts of the world, as are diagnostic facilities, probably accounting for differences in reported birth prevalence between high- and low-income countries. Observed differences may also be of genetic, environmental, socioeconomical, or ethnic origin, and there needs to be further investigation to tailor the management of this global health problem."
23965482,"BACKGROUND: Polymyositis (PM) and dermatomyositis (DM) are infrequent diseases. Data on incidence and prevalence are scarce and conflicting. There are no such data in Latin America and in Argentina in particular. OBJECTIVES: We undertook to examine the incidence and prevalence of PM/DM in the prepaid health maintenance organization (HMO) of our hospital, in the city of Buenos Aires. METHODS: Members of the HMO between January 1999 and June 2009 were identified from medical records of patients followed up by us at the HMO. Incident cases and prevalence were calculated at the end of the period. RESULTS: During the study period, 146,747 persons contributed a total of 937,902.6 person-years (mean age was 46.6 [SD, 18.4] years, and 59% were female). Ten incident cases were detected, 7 women and 3 men with a global incidence rate (IR) of 1.07 per 100,000 person-years (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.5-1.84). Three subjects had DM with an IR of 0.32 per 100,000 person-years (95% CI, 0.1-0.99), and 7 had PM with an IR of 0.75 per 100,000 person-years (95% CI, 0.35-0.16). On June 1, 2009, 17 prevalent cases were detected, with a mean age of 48.9 (SD, 17.7) years; 76% were female, representing a prevalence of 17.4 per 100,000 persons (95% CI, 10.1-27.8). Among the 17 patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathy, 10 patients had DM, with a prevalence of 10.22 per 100,000 persons (95% CI, 4.9-18.8), and 7 had PM (prevalence, 7.2 per 100,000 persons [95% CI, 2.9-14.7]). CONCLUSIONS: It is difficult to compare studies from different populations and using different ascertainment techniques. These first data from Latin America are in general agreement with many studies."
22409362,"Our objective was to investigate incidence of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in Sicily, southern Italy, by means of a population based study. We included people with ALS resident in five Sicilian provinces, whose onset occurred in the two-year period 2005-2006 (population at 31 December 2006: 3,481,096 inhabitants). A multisource case-finding procedure was adopted and patients were classified as affected by ALS according to revised El Escorial criteria. During the two-year surveillance period, 97 patients meeting eligibility criteria included 57 males (58.8%) and 40 females (41.2%). Crude annual incidence rate was 1.4/100,000 person years (95% CI 1.33-1.47). The incidence rate was higher in males (1.71/100,000; CI 1.61-1.81) than in females (1.11/100,000; CI 1.01-1.21). Standardized incidence rate for the total population in the 45-74-years-old age group was 3.22 (CI 3.11-3.33). Prevalence rate was 6.0/100,000 (CI 5.97-6.03), higher in males (7.1/100,000; CI 7.02-7.18) than females (4.9/100,000; CI 4.86-4.94). In conclusion, ALS rates observed in the present study are higher in males than females, with a peak of incidence at 70 years of age in both genders. These findings are consistent with those of other population based European studies."
10619735,"Sporotrichosis is a sporadic and rare mycotic infection in most of the developed world. In many parts of the developing world, sporotrichosis is much more commonly recognized, but epidemiological data are generally lacking from these regions. We report epidemiological, clinical, and treatment data from 238 cases of culture-proven sporotrichosis occurring in a relatively remote area of the south central highlands of Peru that were retrospectively collected during 1995-1997. Most cases (60%) occurred in children aged </=14 years, and the most commonly affected anatomic site was the face. Disease was clinically confined to the skin and subcutaneous tissue in all patients. The incidence of sporotrichosis in this region ranged from 48 to 60 cases per 100,000 persons and was highest among children aged 7-14 years, approaching 1 case per 1000 persons. Sporotrichosis is a significant mycosis in the rural highlands of Peru, with an incidence exceeding those of other invasive mycoses in individuals without human immunodeficiency virus infection."
22119735,"This work provides descriptive epidemiological data of malignant mucosal and uveal melanomas and adnexal skin carcinomas in Europe as defined as in the RARECARE project. We analysed 8669 incident cases registered in the period 1995-2002 by 76 population-based cancer registries (CRs), and followed up for vital status to 31st December 2003. Age-standardised incidence to the European standard population was obtained restricting the analysis to 8416 cancer cases collected by 64 not specialised CRs or with information available only for some anatomical sites. Period survival rates at 2000-2002 were estimated on 45 CRs data. Twenty-two CRs which covered the period 1988-2002 were analysed to obtain the 15-year prevalence (1st January 2003 as reference date). Complete prevalence was calculated by using the completeness index method which estimates surviving cases diagnosed prior to 1988 ('unobserved' prevalence). The expected number of new cases per year and of prevalent cases in Europe was then obtained multiplying the crude incidence and complete prevalence rates to the European population at 2008. We estimated 5204 new cases per year (10.5 per million) to occur in Europe, of which 48.7% were melanomas of uvea, 24.8% melanomas of mucosa and 26.5% adnexal carcinomas of the skin. Five-year relative survival was 40.6% and 68.9% for mucosal and uveal melanomas, respectively. Adnexal skin carcinomas showed a good prognosis with a survival of 87.7% 5 years after diagnosis. Northern Europe, United Kingdom (UK) and Ireland showed the highest 5-year survival rate for uveal melanomas (72.6% and 73.4%), while Southern Europe showed the lowest rate (63.7%). More than 50,000 persons with a past diagnosis of one of these rare cancers were estimated to be alive at 2008 in Europe, most of them (58.8%, n=29,676) being patients with uveal melanoma. Due to the good prognosis and high incidence of uveal melanomas, these malignancies are highly represented among the long-term survivors of the studied rare cancer types. Therefore, maximising quality of life is particularly important in treatment of uveal melanoma. As regards mucosal melanomas, the centralisation of treatment to a select number of specialist centres as well as the establishment of expert pathology panels should be promoted. The geographical differences in incidence and survival should be further investigated analysing the centre of treatment, the stage at diagnosis and the treatment."
25994858,"The birth prevalence of Robin sequence (RS) is frequently cited to be 1 in 8,500 to 14,000 live births (range: 7,1-11,8 per 100.000), which is based on just a few epidemiological studies. The objective of this study is to contribute to the limited knowledge of the epidemiology of RS by determining the frequency of RS in a cleft palate (CP) population and the estimated birth prevalence in live births in the Netherlands, using distinct diagnostic criteria. A retrospective population-based analysis of the National Cleft Registry was performed in order to obtain all CP patients registered in the Netherlands from 2000-2010, in addition to a thorough review of the medical records in three Dutch Academic Pediatric Hospitals for the same period. Furthermore, a systematic search of the literature was conducted to allow for comparison of our findings. The Dutch birth prevalence of RS was estimated to be 1:5,600 live births (or 17.7 per 100,000), with a slight female predominance. RS was estimated to occur in a third of the CP population and patients with RS had a more severe cleft grade than the general CP population. The literature search yielded 42 studies reporting the birth prevalence for RS, which varied between 1:3,900 and 1:122,400 (0.8-32.0 per 100,000), with a mean prevalence of 1:24,500 (8.0 per 100,000). The birth prevalence of RS in the Netherlands was higher than reported for most other countries when similar diagnostic criteria were used, with a slight female predominance. A third of the general CP could be classified as RS."
24753707,"Owing to the rarity of the disease, epidemiologic information on achalasia is limited. This study aimed to investigate the epidemiology and treatment patterns of achalasia in the population of Korea using a national healthcare database. The diagnostic code K22.0 of the International Classification of Diseases was used to identify cases of achalasia between 2007 and 2011. Treatment modalities for achalasia were identified using the electronic data interchange codes Q7642 or Q7641 for balloon dilation and QA421 or QA422 for esophago-cardiomyotomy. A total of 3,105 patients with achalasia (1,447 men; mean age, 52.5 yr) were identified between 2007 and 2011, indicating a prevalence of 6.29/100,000 (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.94-7.66) during this 5-yr period. A total of 191 incident cases of achalasia (82 men; mean age, 49.5 yr), which were not diagnosed as achalasia in the previous 4 yr, were detected in 2011, indicating an incidence of 0.39/100,000 (95% CI, 0.15-0.63) for that year. During the study period, balloon dilation therapy was performed a total of 975 times in 719 patients, and surgical esophago-cardiomyotomy was performed once per patient in 17 patients. This is the first population-based epidemiologic study of achalasia in Korea."
11256661,"PURPOSE:To provide insight into the possible etiology and prevalence of heterotaxy, we studied conditions associated with heterotaxy in a consecutive hospital population of newborns. METHODS:From 1972 to March, 1999 (except February 16, 1972 to December 31, 1978), 58 cases of heterotaxy were ascertained from a cohort of 201,084 births in the ongoing Active Malformation Surveillance Program at the Brigham and Women's Hospital. This registry includes livebirths, stillbirths, and elective abortions. Prevalence among nontransfers (i.e., patients whose mothers had planned delivery at this hospital) was calculated as approximately 1 per 10,000 total births (20 of 201,084). RESULTS:We analyzed a total of 58 patients consisting of 20 (34%) nontransfers and 38 (66%) transfers. Patients were categorized by spleen status as having asplenia (7 nontransfers, 25 total), polysplenia (8, 20), right spleen (4, 11), normal left (0, 1), and unknown (1, 0). Among the 20 nontransfer and 59 total heterotaxy patients, the following associated medical conditions were present: chromosome abnormality (1 nontransfer, 2 total), suspected Mendelian or chromosome microdeletion disorder (1 nontransfer, 6 total), and maternal insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (1 nontransfer, 2 total). There were 6 twins (1 member each from 6 twin pairs including 1 dizygous, 4 monozygous, 1 conjoined; 2 were nontransfers). An associated condition occurred in 5 (25%) nontransfer and 16 (28%) total patients, or among 10 of 53 singleton births (19%). CONCLUSIONS:Although most cases of heterotaxy in this series were sporadic events, an associated condition was present in about one-fourth of the cases. Not all of these conditions would be considered causative etiologies. Based on this small series alone, maternal insulin-dependent diabetes cannot be viewed as a risk factor for heterotaxy. However, the specific association of diabetes with polysplenia with/without left atrial isomerism is noteworthy, and adds weight to animal and epidemiologic case-control data."
23337900,"Leptospirosis is a zoonosis found worldwide, the main reservoir of which is the rat. Human infection generally results from exposure to contaminated river or lake water or animals. Around 600 cases are diagnosed per year in France. Half of these cases occur in French overseas territories, where the incidence can be more than 100 times higher than in mainland France. Leptospirosis has been under-diagnosed because of non-specific symptoms, inadequate surveillance system, and lack of readily available quick and simple diagnostic tests. Most cases of leptospirosis are currently detected by PCR amplification of bacterial DNA from the blood during the first week after the onset of symptoms, or by detection of antibodies during the second week of the disease. More than 300 serovars have been identified among leptospires, including serovar Icterohaemorrhagiae, the most frequent in human infections. Leptospirosis remains a major public health issue in many developing countries, one century after discovering the causative agent. Leptospirosis is expected to become more important due to a rapid urbanization in developing countries (slums), global warming, and extreme climatic events (floods)."
1518020,Data from 98 patients with hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) are presented. All were symptomatic by 40 years of age and 62% by 16 years. Nose bleeding was the first symptom of disease in 90% of cases with mucocutaneous telangiectases appearing 5 to 20 years later. Complications of HHT are discussed and an age of onset curve given.
22723332,"BACKGROUND: Recent reports suggest that the incidence of congenital hypothyroidism (CHT) is increasing in some countries. The etiology of this change is unclear, and it may relate to changes in screening thresholds. We aimed to determine whether the incidence of CHT in New Zealand has changed and whether ethnic-specific rates and the rates of CHT subtypes have also changed. METHODS: The New Zealand neonatal TSH-based screening program has prospectively identified cases of CHT using the same assay and screening thresholds since 1993. Thyroid scintiscans are routinely recommended. We retrospectively identified all cases of CHT requiring levothyroxine treatment from 1993-2010 recorded by the national newborn screening program (>99.5% coverage). Among other parameters, ethnic and CHT subtype-specific incidence rates were calculated. RESULTS: There were 330 new cases of CHT and 1,053,457 live births registered in New Zealand in the 18-yr period, and 86% of cases had a scintiscan, 67% of which had thyroid dysgenesis (female to male ratio 5.0:1.0) and 33% dyshormonogenesis (0.9:1.0). The overall incidence of CHT rose from 2.6 to 3.6 per 10,000 live births (P < 0.01). The incidence of dyshormonogenesis (P = 0.01) increased but not of dysgenesis (P = 0.13). This was mediated by a 2-fold increase in Asian births and 40% increase in Pacific Island births. Both ethnic groups displayed higher rates of dyshormonogenesis compared with New Zealand Europeans (odds ratio 3.3 and 2.6, respectively). There was no change in the ethnic-specific incidences of CHT. CONCLUSION: Although the incidence of congenital hypothyroidism in New Zealand has increased, this is due to changes in the country's ethnic composition."
14705166,"In 1975, dihydropteridine reductase (DHPR) deficiency was first recognized as a cause of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH(4)) deficiency, leading to hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) and impaired biogenic amine deficiency. So far, more than 150 patients scattered worldwide have been reported and major progresses have been made in the understanding of physiopathology, screening, diagnosis, treatment, and molecular genetics of this inherited disease. Present knowledge on different aspects of DHPR deficiency, largely derived from authors' personal experience, is traced in this article."
1602157,"An indirect method for estimating the birth prevalence of the Apert syndrome is presented. The fraction of Apert syndrome patients in large clinical surveys of all cases of craniosynostosis is calculated and the fractional component obtained is multiplied by the known birth prevalence of craniosynostosis in general. Apert syndrome makes up approximately 4% of all cases of craniosynostosis. Using a weighted average estimate, birth prevalence was calculated to be 13.7/1,000,000. The results of the indirect method compare favorably with those obtained by the direct method. Nevertheless, because the indirect method is based on a number of assumptions that are easily violated, we cannot recommend its general use except under special conditions."
10482430,"BACKGROUND:This study aimed to describe the clinical features, manometric findings, prevalence and incidence of achalasia in Singapore. METHODS:A total of 615 new patients referred for oesophageal manometry between 1989 and 1996 were examined prospectively. Twenty-four men and 25 women fulfilled the manometric and clinical criteria for achalasia. RESULTS:Their median age of onset of symptoms was 37 years (range 15-71) and 37% first developed symptoms after the age of 50 years. The presenting symptoms were dysphagia (100%), regurgitation (80%), weight loss (67%) and chest discomfort (33%). Five patients (10%) had a history of benign (mostly autoimmune) thyroid disorders. Endoscopy was reported as normal in 10/43 patients (23%) and achalasia was suggested in only 31 (72%) of 43 barium examinations. Lower oesophageal sphincter (LOS) dysfunction was present in 82% of cases. Using data from medical records and from a survey of gastroenterologists and surgeons in Singapore, the prevalence (in 1996) and incidence of achalasia in Singapore were estimated to be 1.8 per 100000, and 0.3 per 100000 per year, respectively. The incidence was significantly lower in Malays than Chinese or Indians. The age-specific incidence of achalasia for both genders followed a bimodal distribution with the larger peak in the sixth decade. No cases of oesophageal carcinoma were identified among these patients. CONCLUSION:Achalasia is an uncommon condition in Singapore. The clinical and manometric features were similar to those described in Western countries."
18442953,"This study combined a variety of methods to determine the prevalence of cystic fibrosis in the European Union. The results of literature reviews, surveys, and registry analyses revealed a mean prevalence of 0.737/10,000 in the 27 EU countries, which is similar to the value of 0.797 in the United States, and only one outlier, namely the Republic of Ireland at 2.98."
23050777,"Neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM) is defined as diabetes with onset before 6 months of age. Nearly half of individuals with NDM are affected by permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus (PNDM). Mutations in KATP channel genes (KCNJ11, ABCC8) and the insulin gene (INS) are the most common causes of PNDM.To estimate the prevalence of PNDM among SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth (SEARCH) study participants (2001-2008) and to identify the genetic mutations causing PNDM.SEARCH is a multicenter population-based study of diabetes in youth <20 yr of age. Participants diagnosed with diabetes before 6 months of age were invited for genetic testing for mutations in the KCNJ11, ABCC8, and INS genes.Of the 15,829 SEARCH participants with diabetes, 39 were diagnosed before 6 months of age. Thirty-five of them had PNDM (0.22% of all diabetes cases in SEARCH), 3 had transient neonatal diabetes that had remitted by 18 months and 1 was unknown. The majority of them (66.7%) had a clinical diagnosis of type1 diabetes by their health care provider. Population prevalence of PNDM in youth <20 yr was estimated at 1 in 252 000. Seven participants underwent genetic testing; mutations causing PNDM were identified in five (71%), (two KCNJ11, three INS).We report the first population-based frequency of PNDM in the US based on the frequency of PNDM in SEARCH. Patients with NDM are often misclassified as having type1 diabetes. Widespread education is essential to encourage appropriate genetic testing and treatment of NDM."
12911872,"Over the last 10 years an increasing amount of data regarding the prevalence of chronic daily headache (CDH) has been published. The economic implications of chronic daily headache have now grown in importance in view of the increasingly limited financial resources in the health care system. In addition to recording data regarding the prevalence of this disease, epidemiological studies have also dealt with analysing and evaluating the quality of life of the afflicted patients. According to population-based data from the USA, Europe and Asia, approx. 4-5% of the population suffer from chronic daily headache. These have been equated up until now with chronic tension-type headache (CTTH). More recent epidemiological studies have resulted in an adaptation of this point of view. Currently it is assumed that approx. 2-3% of the population suffer CTTH, which preferably affects females (approximately twice as frequently); approx. 2 % suffer chronic migraine (transformed migraine = TM) and 0.2 % are afflicted with a so-called  new daily persistent headache  or very rarely a hemicrania continua."
23775876,"UNLABELLED: Extensive population-based studies are much needed to accurately establish epidemiology and disease course in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). We aimed to obtain population-based prevalence and incidence figures, insight in disease course with regard to survival, liver transplantation (LT), and occurrence of malignancies, as well as risk factors thereof. Four independent hospital databases were searched in 44 hospitals in a large geographically defined area of the Netherlands, comprising 50% of the population. In addition, all PSC patients in the three Dutch liver transplant centers and all inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients in the adherence area of a large district hospital were identified. All medical records were reviewed on-site, verifying diagnosis. Five hundred and ninety PSC patients were identified, resulting in an incidence of 0.5 and a point prevalence of 6.0 per 100,000. Median follow up was 92 months. Estimated median survival from diagnosis until LT or PSC-related death in the entire cohort was 21.3 years, as opposed to 13.2 years in the combined transplant centers cohort (n = 422; P < 0.0001). Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) risk was 10-fold increased, as compared to ulcerative colitis controls, and developed at a much younger age (39 years; range, 26-64), compared to IBD controls (59 years; range, 34-73; P = 0.019). Colonoscopic surveillance was associated with significantly better outcome. CONCLUSION: This study exemplifies that, for relatively rare diseases, it is paramount to collect observational data from large, population-based cohorts, because incidence and prevalence rates of PSC are markedly lower and survival much longer than previously reported. The selection of a bias-free, population-based cohort showed a significantly longer survival, compared to the tertiary referral cohort. CRC can develop at an early age, warranting surveillance from time of PSC diagnosis."
23239049,"Epidemiological data is important to correctly quantify the extent of disease and needed health care resources. The aim of the study was to establish the prevalence and incidence of pituitary adenomas (PAs) in the same well defined population, with in-depth analysis of the various subtypes. The design involved a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of PA patients diagnosed prior to 31 July 2011 for prevalence estimates and those diagnosed between July 2000 and July 2011 for incidence estimation. A thorough search for patients with PAs was carried out in central hospital registries including outpatients departments, surgical registries, radiological department and specialty clinic databases. Prevalence rates/100,000 and Standardised incidence ratios (SIR)/100,000/year were worked out. The respective prevalence rates and SIR for PAs overall were 75.7/100,000, and 4.27/100,000/year, for Prolactinomas 35.0/100,000 and 2.05/100,000/year, for nonfunctioning PA 25.9/100,000 and 1.79/100,000/year and for GH-secreting PAs 12.5/100,000 and 0.31/100,000/year. The overall prevalence for macroadenomas was 32.8/100,000 and SIR was 1.49/100,000/year. The prevalence rate in males for PAs overall was 46.3/100,000 and SIR was 2.08/100,000/year and in females 104.8/100,000 and SIR was 6.58/100,000/year. Females had a lower proportion of macroadenomas than males (29.5 vs. 75.0%; P < 0.001) and macroadenomas tended to present at a later age compared to microadenomas (48 vs. 34.5; P < 0.001). The highest SIR was reached in the 30-39 age group at 7.42/100,000/year. Our data confirm the considerable disease burden that PAs bear on health care resources. Males and females have similar prevalence and SIR rates for macroadenomas but there is a significant increase in SIR in females of child bearing age compared to males. These observations may have important implications in terms of the economic burden and need for early intervention."
18782254,"The Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) provides care for more than 40% of the Mexican population. This report constitutes the first study of the incidence of congenital hypothyroidism (CH) in Mexican children. We performed a prospective study with a population base. CH screening began in 1997 with blood samples from the heel taken 72 h after birth; from 2000, the detection strategy was changed nationwide and blood samples were taken from the umbilical cord in all newborns for determination of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentration. We evaluated the annual coverage. TSH concentration was measured by chemoluminescence; TSH values > or =30 microIU/mL in umbilical cord blood and 15 microIU/mL in capillary blood were considered positive cases and were confirmed through hormonal studies. The incidence and 95% confidence intervals [95% CI] were calculated. We found that coverage within the IMSS population was 53% from 1997 to 2000 and had increased to 95% by 2001. A total of 2,777,292 children from 2,975,157 births (93%) were studied between 2000 and 2004. Of these, 4050 had a high TSH concentration leading to suspicion of CH; CH was confirmed in 1286 (32%). The resulting incidence was 4.3/10,000 livebirths [95% CI 3.6, 5.1]. With the results obtained, we conclude that the IMSS strategy of CH screening at birth ensured 95% coverage of children in the system. The birth prevalence of CH reported is among the highest in the world."
17360728,"All hospitalisations for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in the Scottish population were examined to determine the epidemiological features of PAH. These data were compared with expert data from the Scottish Pulmonary Vascular Unit (SPVU). Using the linked Scottish Morbidity Record scheme, data from all adults aged 16-65 yrs admitted with PAH (idiopathic PAH, pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital heart abnormalities and pulmonary hypertension associated with connective tissue disorders) during the period 1986-2001 were identified. These data were compared with the most recent data in the SPVU database (2005). Overall, 374 Scottish males and females aged 16-65 yrs were hospitalised with incident PAH during 1986-2001. The annual incidence of PAH was 7.1 cases per million population. On December 31, 2002, there were 165 surviving cases, giving a prevalence of PAH of 52 cases per million population. Data from the SPVU were available for 1997-2006. In 2005, the last year with a complete data set, the incidence of PAH was 7.6 cases per million population and the corresponding prevalence was 26 cases per million population. Hospitalisation data from the Scottish Morbidity Record scheme gave higher prevalences of pulmonary arterial hypertension than data from the expert centres (Scotland and France). The hospitalisation data may overestimate the true frequency of pulmonary arterial hypertension in the population, but it is also possible that the expert centres underestimate the true frequency."
24745674,"This article updates current knowledge about epidemiology, prognosis, and risk factors for major complications in mastocytosis. A prevalence of mastocytosis of 1 in 10000 inhabitants has been reported, but underdiagnosis is assumed. The prognosis for cutaneous and indolent systemic mastocytosis is excellent. For more advanced forms of disease, prognostic parameters have been identified. A high extent of skin involvement, increased basal serum tryptase values, and extensive blistering are risk factors for severe mast cell activation episodes in children, whereas these associations seem to be less strong or nonexistent for anaphylaxis and osteoporosis in adult patients with indolent systemic mastocytosis."
24161450,"Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a term used to describe a variety of disorders characterized by spontaneous or stimulus-induced pain that is disproportional to the inciting event and accompanied by a myriad of autonomic and motor disturbances in highly variable combinations. There are no standards which can be applied to the diagnosis and would fulfill definitions of evidence-based medicine. Indeed, there are almost as many diagnostic criteria as there are names to this disorder. The umbrella term CRPS has been subdivided into type I and type II. CRPS I is intended to encompass reflex sympathetic dystrophy and similar disorders without a nerve injury; while CRPS II occurs after damage to a peripheral nerve. There are numerous etiological pathophysiological events that have been incriminated in development of CRPS, including inflammation, autoimmune responses, abnormal cytokine production, sympathetic-sensory disorders, altered blood flow and central cortical reorganization. However, the number of studies that have included appropriate controls and have sufficient numbers of patients to allow statistical analysis with appropriate power calculations is vanishingly small. This has led to over-diagnosis and often excessive pharmacotherapy and even unnecessary surgical interventions. In this review we provide a detailed critical overview of not only the history of CRPS, but also the epidemiology, the clinical features, the pathophysiological studies, the proposed criteria, the therapy and, in particular, an emphasis that future research should apply more rigorous standards to allow a better understanding of CRPS, i.e. what it is, if it is, and when it is."
23628138,"In Central Europe, classical alveolar echinococcosis (AE) is endemic. Annual incidences in Austria were 2.4 and 2.8 cases/100,000 population during 1991-2000 and 2001-2010, respectively. Hence, the registration of 13 new AE patients in 2011 was unexpected. Increasing fox populations and past AE underreporting might have caused this increase."
9279758,"Auditory-pigmentary syndromes are caused by physical absence of melanocytes from the skin, hair, eyes, or the stria vascularis of the cochlea. Dominantly inherited examples with patchy depigmentation are usually labelled Waardenburg syndrome (WS). Type I WS, characterised by dystopia canthorum, is caused by loss of function mutations in the PAX3 gene. Type III WS (Klein-Waardenburg syndrome, with abnormalities of the arms) is an extreme presentation of type I; some but not all patients are homozygotes. Type IV WS (Shah-Waardenburg syndrome with Hirschsprung disease) can be caused by mutations in the genes for endothelin-3 or one of its receptors, EDNRB. Type II WS is a heterogeneous group, about 15% of whom are heterozygous for mutations in the MITF (microphthalmia associated transcription factor) gene. All these forms show marked variability even within families, and at present it is not possible to predict the severity, even when a mutation is detected. Characterising the genes is helping to unravel important developmental pathways in the neural crest and its derivatives."
23120941,"INTRODUCTION: Esophageal cancer is the 6th most common cause of cancer death in the world. During the past two decades some changes have occurred in histologic type and primary tumor location in some parts of the world but there is a little information about histopathological aspect of disease in Iran. The purpose of the present study was to clarify the features of histopathological of esophageal cancer in Iran. METHODS: This study designed as a cross sectional study. Data analysis was performed with descriptive and univariate methods. Information required for this study extracted from cancer registry forms. The cases were all patients who received a histopathological diagnosis of EC that were referred to this center from January 2003 to October 2008. RESULTS: A total of 264 EC cases were recruited in the study the lower third of the esophagus was the most frequent site of origin of these tumors. Squamus cell carcinoma was commonest histologic type of tumor. In 15.2% of cases tumor was metastasis to other organs. In 46.6% were in advanced stage at diagnosis. DISCUSSION: Based on result of present study, esophageal cancer in our country more presented in Squamus cell carcinoma histology type, in advanced stage. Since Squamus cell carcinoma have a poorer prognosis and given that these patients have vague symptomatology for approximately several months, therefore, early diagnosis and treatment led to better prognosis."
7977461,"Here we describe a statistically significant association between hypospadias and spina bifida. This association was identified through the Spanish Collaborative Study of Congenital Malformations (ECEMC), where the observed number of cases was greater (P << 0.0005) than expected just by chance among males. We also detected a pair of concordant twins who had monochorial monoamniotic placenta. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of this combination of defects, consequently it must be confirmed whether this statistic association is an entity."
205132,"Patients with Poland syndrome were ascertained through the British Columbia Health Surveillance Registry, through hospital records, and through practicing plastic and orthopedic surgeons. Of 44 patients who were ascertained, 28 had family histories taken and were examined. Physical findings were: absence of the sternal head of the pectoralis major in all patients, symbrachydactyly in most patients, and infrequent other associations such as ipsilateral undescended testis, Möbius syndrome, clubfoot, and submucous cleft palate. Family histories were ""negative"" in all cases. The 8 affected adults had 24 reportedly normal children. Mean paternal age was significantly higher than the paternal age in the population. The incidence was 1/32,000 livebirths in British Columbia. It was concluded that in the British Columbia population the syndrome is usually a sporadic event."
18433916,"Little is known about the occurrence of Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC) in the population of the United Kingdom or its associated risks of mortality and malignancy. We aimed to fill these gaps in knowledge.We identified 223 people with PSC and 2217 control subjects from the General Practice Research Database in the UK. We calculated incidence rates (1991-2001) and mortality rates and used Poisson and Cox regression to make comparisons between populations.There were 149 incident cases giving a rate of 0.41 per 100,000 person years (95% CI 0.34-0.48) and a prevalence in 2001 of 3.85 per 100,000 (95% CI 3.04 to 4.80). The incidence of PSC increased about 50% over the period studied and was higher in men compared with women. There was a three-fold mortality rate increase (Hazard ratio 2.92 (95% CI 2.16-3.94) in people with PSC compared to the general population, a two-fold increase in risk of any malignancy and a 40-fold increase in the risk of primary liver cancer (HR 2.23 and 37.44, respectively).We believe this paper provides the most reliable estimates of the occurrence of PSC and of its risk in terms of death and malignancy in the UK available to date."
18669133,"BACKGROUND: Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis is a rare pustular severe cutaneous adverse reaction characterized by a rapid clinical course and unique histological findings. It is usually attributed to drugs, although other factors have also been implicated. OBJECTIVES: To analyze demographic, clinical and laboratory data of AGEP cases in Israel, based on the RegisCAR study, a multinational European study. METHODS: Patients included in the present study were actively recruited by the Israeli RegiSCAR network, which comprised 10 dermatology departments and units. The cases were validated by a multinational expert committee of dermatologists based on a standardized scoring system. RESULTS: Overall, 11 potential cases of AGEP were collected in Israel: 9 (81.8%) definite and 2 (19.2%) possible. The adjusted annual incidence of AGEP in Israel was 0.35/million/year. The nine definite cases that entered the analyses showed a male/female ratio of 0.28 with an age range of 10-60 years. Most cases were reported during the summer months. The clinical course and laboratory findings in most of our patients were in accordance with previous reports. A drug etiology was suspected in the majority of cases and consisted of analgesics (66.7%), antibiotics (22.2%) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (11.1%) as the main culprit drugs. CONCLUSIONS: Whereas the clinical and laboratory findings of AGEP in Israel corresponded to the reported features of AGEP in the literature, some unique findings were noted, namely, marked female predominance, seasonality and a profile of culprit drugs."
24393603,"BACKGROUND: Inherited ichthyoses represent a group of rare skin disorders characterized by scaling, hyperkeratosis and inconstant erythema, involving most of the tegument. Epidemiology remains poorly described. This study aims to evaluate the prevalence of inherited ichthyosis (excluding very mild forms) and its different clinical forms in France. METHODS: Capture - recapture method was used for this study. According to statistical requirements, 3 different lists (reference/competence centres, French association of patients with ichthyosis and internet network) were used to record such patients. The study was conducted in 5 areas during a closed period. RESULTS: The prevalence was estimated at 13.3 per million people (/M) (CI95%, [10.9 - 17.6]). With regard to autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis, the prevalence was estimated at 7/M (CI 95% [5.7 - 9.2]), with a prevalence of lamellar ichthyosis and congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma of 4.5/M (CI 95% [3.7 - 5.9]) and 1.9/M (CI 95% [1.6 - 2.6]), respectively. Prevalence of keratinopathic forms was estimated at 1.1/M (CI 95% [0.9 - 1.5]). Prevalence of syndromic forms (all clinical forms together) was estimated at 1.9/M (CI 95% [1.6 - 2.6]). CONCLUSIONS: Our results constitute a crucial basis to properly size the necessary health measures that are required to improve patient care and design further clinical studies."
2151397,"As part of a multidisciplinary study program, an epidemiological descriptive survey was carried out in the province of Ferrara, northern Italy. The temporal trend of Huntington chorea (HC) in the last century (1871-1987) was determined in the study area, and the patients and subjects at risk were identified with the aim of creating genetic advisory councils offering preventive interventions to eliminate the disease. The final study population consisted of 10 unrelated families with HC and 47 HC cases who lived in the province of Ferrara in the survey period. The estimate of the prevalence rate varied over the time period considered between 3.09 and 0.36 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. The temporal trend was characterized by increasing and decreasing phases, reflecting the incidence (varying between 0.20 and 0.00 annual cases per 100,000 inhabitants) and mortality (varying between 0.21 and 0.00 annual deaths per 100,000 inhabitants) rates. This trend shows that the frequency of HC in the study area was not stable. It was characterized by a cyclic course with a period of about 50 years. In the recent decades of the study, the incidence and the prevalence rates showed a relative increase. Thus, HC persists in the Ferrara population despite a greater public awareness and the recent lower birth rate. A new peak of prevalence is likely in the near future."
21241453,"INTRODUCTION: Postorgasmic illness syndrome (POIS) is a combination of local allergic symptoms and transient flu-like illness. In this study, the investigators propose five preliminary criteria to establish the diagnosis. AIM: To describe the clinical details in 45 males being suspected of having POIS and to test an immunogenic hypothesis as the underlying mechanism of their presentations. METHODS: Forty-five males were studied according to standardized protocol, including neuropsychiatric and medical sexological evaluations; their complaints were categorized using their own words, and their self-perceived intravaginal ejaculation latency time (IELT). Skin-prick testing with autologous diluted semen in 33 men were also performed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical features of POIS including self-perceived IELTs and the results of skin-prick testing with autologous diluted seminal fluid. RESULTS: Of the 45 included men, 33 subjects consented with skin-prick testing. Of them, 29 (88%) men had a positive skin-prick test with their own (autologous) semen, and four had a negative test. In 87% of men, POIS symptoms started within 30 minutes after ejaculation. Complaints of POIS were categorized in seven clusters of symptoms, e.g., general, flu-like, head, eyes, nose, throat, and muscles. Local allergic reactions of eyes and nose were reported in 44% and 33% of subjects, a flu-like syndrome in 78% of subjects, exhaustion and concentration difficulties in 80% and 87% of subjects. Of all subjects, 58% had an atopic constitution. Lifelong premature ejaculation, defined as self-perceived IELT < 1 minute, was reported in 25 (56%) of subjects. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of allergic and systemic flu-like reactions post-ejaculation together with a positive skin-prick test in the majority of males underscores the hypothesis of an ""immunogenic"" etiology of POIS, e.g., that POIS is caused by Type-1 and Type-IV allergy to the males' own semen, as soon it is triggered by ejaculation."
23362848,"Achromatopsia (ACHM) is a severe retinal disorder characterized by an inability to distinguish colors, impaired visual acuity, photophobia and nystagmus. This rare autosomal recessive disorder of the cone photoreceptors is best known for its increased frequency due to founder effect in the Pingelapese population of the Pacific islands. Sixteen patients from Newfoundland, Canada were sequenced for mutations in the four known achromatopsia genes CNGA3, CNGB3, GNAT2, and PDE6C. The majority (n = 12) of patients were either homozygotes or compound heterozygotes for known achromatopsia alleles, two in CNGB3 (p.T383fsX and p.T296YfsX9) and three in CNGA3 (p.R283Q, p.R427C and p.L527R). Haplotype reconstruction showed that recurrent mutations p.T383fsX and p.L527R were due to a founder effect. Aggregate data from exome sequencing, segregation analysis and archived medical records support a rediagnosis of Jalili syndrome in affected siblings (n = 4) from Family 0094, which to our knowledge is the first family identified with Jalili Syndrome in North America."
3421146,"Twenty-eight patients with Bartter's syndrome diagnosed during the years 1964-86 and followed for an average of 9.9 years have been reviewed. Their mean age at the time of diagnosis was 32.9 years. As a group they were shorter than normal subjects. In 19 patients hypokalaemia was detected incidentally. Neuromuscular symptoms, usually minor, had occurred in 19 subjects. Pregnancies and deliveries were unremarkable. One patient has died from malignant lymphoma, the others are alive. Of these, one patient has developed renal failure and received a renal transplant. The other patients have preserved a normal renal function and the majority have been healthy and working full time. Treatment rarely resulted in normokalaemia. The annual incidence of the syndrome has been estimated at 1.2 per million people."
29652087,"ZNF335 plays an essential role in neurogenesis and biallelic variants in ZNF335 have been identified as the cause of severe primary autosomal recessive microcephaly in 2 unrelated families. We describe, herein, 2 additional affected individuals with biallelic ZNF335 variants, 1 individual with a homozygous c.1399 T > C, p.(Cys467Arg) variant, and a second individual with compound heterozygous c.2171_2173delTCT, p.(Phe724del) and c.3998A > G, p.(Glu1333Gly) variants with the latter variant predicted to affect splicing. Whereas the first case presented with early death and a severe phenotype characterized by anterior agyria with prominent extra-axial spaces, absent basal ganglia, and hypoplasia of the brainstem and cerebellum, the second case had a milder clinical presentation with hypomyelination and otherwise preserved brain structures on MRI. Our findings expand the clinical spectrum of ZNF335-associated microcephaly."
6626279,"We have studied the epidemiology of giant cell arteritis (GCA) in an urban population in south central United States. The incidence of GCA in Shelby County, Tennessee for the years 1971 through 1980 was determined for the total population and for age-, sex-, and race-specific groups. Over this period 26 cases were identified. The average annual incidence was 0.35/100,000. This was increased to 1.58/100,000 for those over the age of 50. The incidence was 7 times greater in whites than in blacks and 7 times greater in females than in males. Clinical and laboratory features of the patients were reviewed and found to be similar to those in other populations. GCA is considerably less frequent in Shelby County, Tennessee than in other areas where similar epidemiologic studies have been performed. This difference can be accounted for only in part by racial distributions. Similar studies in southern geographic areas are needed to place our findings in perspective and point to specific factors which may have etiologic significance in GCA."
11284994,"Epidemiological data on chronic polyneuropathies, especially inflammatory types, is limited. The purpose of this study was to examine the spectrum of causes and estimated prevalence of various polyneuropathy types in Vest-Agder, and to examine the clinical features of the Vest-Agder population of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). In Vest-Agder county (population of 155 464), polyneuropathy patients are registered in a database and followed prospectively. We did a measure of the database on October 31 1999. A total of 192 patients were registered. The prevalence for chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) was 7.7 per 100 000 population. The course was relapsing in five of fifteen patients, progressive in four patients and slowly progressive in six of fifteen patients. Two of the fifteen patients had pure sensory symptoms. The mean Rankin disability score was 3.4 at maximal deficit and 2.1 at last follow-up. The prevalence of paraproteinemic polyneuropathy was 5.1 per 100 000 population. None of the patients with paraproteinemic polyneuropathy were worse than slightly disabled (disability score < or = 2). The prevalences for other polyneuropathies were as follows: polyneuropathy and RA, 1.3; polyneuropathy and Sjögren's syndrome or sicca complex, 4.5 (polyneuropathy was the presenting symptom in five of seven patients); sarcoidosis 1.9; polyneuropathy and chronic Lyme, 0.6; paraneoplastic polyneuropathy, 1.9; diabetic polyneuropathy 23.2; vitamin deficiency, 5.1; alcoholic and toxic polyneuropathy, 19.9; hereditary polyneuropathy, 14.8. Cryptogenic polyneuropathies made up 26% of all polyneuropathies. The mean disability score was 2.0 (SD 1.1). In conclusion, prevalence of CIDP was significantly higher than previously reported, and the prognosis was good in the majority of patients. Patients with paraproteinemic polyneuropathy were not severely disabled. Polyneuropathy was the presenting symptom in the majority of patients with Sjögren's syndrome or sicca complex."
19914636,"OBJECTIVE: To allow early recognition of cystathionine beta-synthase by newborn screening. STUDY DESIGN: Total homocysteine was determined in dried blood spots with a novel, robust high-performance liquid chromatography method with tandem mass spectrometry. Quantification of homocysteine was linear over a working range up to 50 micromol/L. For mutation analysis, DNA was tested for 2 mutations common in Qatar. RESULTS: Both methods proved to be suitable for high throughput processing. In 2 years, 7 infants with classic homocystinuria were identified of 12,603 native Qatari infants, yielding an incidence of 1:1800. Molecular screening would have missed 1 patient homozygous for a mutation not previously identified in the Qatari population. Over a period of 3 years, a total of 14 cases of classic homocystinuria were detected by screening of homocysteine from all newborn infants born in Qatar (n = 46 406). Homocysteine was always elevated, whereas methionine was elevated in only 7 cases. CONCLUSIONS: The study offers a reliable method for newborn screening for cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency, reaching a sensitivity of up to 100%, even if samples are taken within the first 3 days of life."
3594933,"Retinitis pigmentosa was diagnosed in 101 persons from 53 families. The prognosis for visual function was most favourable for the autosomal dominant group (38 patients from 8 families). The autosomal recessive group (40 patients from 25 families) and the 19 solitary cases were very heterogeneous, with prognosis ranging from favourable to very bad. There was a higher intrafamiliar correlation in the autosomal recessive than in the autosomal dominant group. In 28 patients from 18 families with Usher syndrome, almost all had good visual function until 30 years of age, and few had useful visual function after the age of 50. The age when the patients were registered varied between the different genetic types of retinitis pigmentosa, reflecting differences in prognosis. Therefore, ascertainment probability and prevalence were calculated for each genetic group separately. The prevalence of retinitis pigmentosa in Norway, all genetic groups included, was calculated to be 1/4440, the autosomal dominant type of the disease being the most frequent. The prevalence of Usher syndrome was calculated to be 3.6/100,000. Both retinitis pigmentosa and Usher syndrome were more prevalent in Laps."
20623298,"The annual incidence of myasthenia gravis (MG) ranges from 3 to 30 per 1,000,000 people. Since the mid-1980s, an increasing incidence has been reported, mainly due to late-onset MG. Whether the increase was due to population aging, improved diagnosis and case collection, or a true excess of incidence cases is still under debate. We used a complete enumeration approach by reviewing all possible sources of case collection in the province of Ferrara, Italy, to estimate the MG incidence and its temporal trend over the study period (1985-2007). The mean annual age-adjusted incidence of MG was 18 per 1,000,000, without any significant temporal trend. The incidence rates in the period 1985-1990 were 14 both for early and late-onset MG. Thereafter, a significant increase in incidence of late-onset MG (p < 0.05), and a decrease in early onset MG were detected (p < 0.01). These findings were related to nonthymoma MG. The median age at onset of the disease steadily increased over time. A changing pattern of MG incidence with an increase in frequency of late-onset and a decrease of early onset MG was found in the last years, giving a significant shift to older age at onset of the disease. Unknown environmental factors may have driven this change in MG epidemiology."
12107518,"PURPOSE: To estimate the prevalence of Usher syndrome in Heidelberg and Mannheim and to map its geographical distribution in Germany. METHODS: Usher syndrome patients were ascertained through the databases of the Low Vision Department at the University of Heidelberg, and of the patient support group Pro Retina. Ophthalmic and audiologic examinations and medical records were used to classify patients into one of the subtypes. RESULTS: The database of the University of Heidelberg contains 247 Usher syndrome patients, 63 with Usher syndrome type 1 (USH1) and 184 with Usher syndrome type 2 (USH2). The USH1:USH2 ratio in the Heidelberg database was 1:3. The Pro Retina database includes 248 Usher syndrome patients, 21 with USH1 and 227 with USH2. The total number of Usher syndrome patients was 424, with 75 USH1 and 349 USH2 patients; 71 patients were in both databases. The prevalence of Usher syndrome in Heidelberg and suburbs was calculated to be 6.2 per 100,000 inhabitants. There seems to be a homogeneous distribution in Germany for both subtypes. CONCLUSION: Knowledge of the high prevalence of Usher syndrome, with up to 5,000 patients in Germany, should lead to increased awareness and timely diagnosis by ophthalmologists and otologists. It should also ensure that these patients receive good support through hearing and vision aids."
24100174,"Alternating hemiplegia of childhood (AHC) is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by early-onset recurrent distinctive hemiplegic episodes commonly accompanied by other paroxysmal features and developmental impairment. De novo mutations in ATP1A3 were recently identified as a genetic cause of AHC. To describe the entire Danish cohort of paediatric AHC patients we approached neuropaediatricians nationwide. All currently acknowledged Danish patients ≤16 years with AHC were genetically tested and seen by the same child neurologist (PU). Ten patients; seven girls and three boys were identified. Mean present age was 10.0 years (range 1-16). Mean age at presentation was 7.4 months (range 1-18 months). Sequencing of ATP1A3 in all ten patients revealed a pathogenic mutation in seven. Two females with moderate psychomotor impairment were heterozygous for the known p.G947R mutation, whereas one severely retarded boy was heterozygous for the common p.E815K mutation. The prevalent p.D801N mutation was identified in two moderate to severely retarded children. Interestingly, in a set of monochorionic male twins a novel p.D801E mutation was identified, underscoring that the asparagine at position 801 is a mutation hotspot. Three girls aged 5-13 years did not reveal any ATP1A3 mutations. They were rather mildly clinically affected and displayed a normal or near-normal psychomotor development. This is the first study of AHC in the Danish paediatric population. The patients harboured a wide range of psychomotor difficulties. Patients with no mutation detected tended to be less severely affected. Prevalence was approximately 1 per 100,000 children."
20558556,"BACKGROUND: REVEAL (The Registry to Evaluate Early and Long-term Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Disease Management) provides current demographics of patients with group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in the United States. METHODS: A total of 2,967 patients with PAH diagnosed based on right-sided heart catheterization were enrolled in REVEAL between March 2006 and September 2007. Demographics from the REVEAL patient cohort and REVEAL subpopulations (matched by inclusion criteria to other registries) were compared with historic US registry data and other contemporary US and non-US national PAH registries by inclusion criteria, including the National Institutes of Health (NIH) PAH registry and the French PAH registry. RESULTS: REVEAL patients matched to NIH registry patients were older at diagnosis (mean ± SE, 44.9 ± 0.6 years vs 36.4 ± 1.1 years; difference, 8.5 ± 1.4; P < .001) and more likely to be women (78.7 ± 1.2% vs 63.1 ± 3.5%; P < .001). REVEAL patients matched to French registry patients had similar age and severity at diagnosis, but REVEAL patients were more likely to be women (79.8 ± 0.8% vs 65.3 ± 1.8%; P < .001) and obese (BMI, ≥ 30 kg/m(2), 32.5 ± 1.0% vs 14.8 ± 1.4%; P < .001), whereas French patients were more likely to have HIV-associated PAH (6.2% vs 2.3%). The female preponderance is similar to that in other US-based contemporary registries. CONCLUSIONS: At diagnosis, REVEAL patients were older than NIH registry patients and similar in age to patients enrolled in contemporary registries. Compared with NIH and contemporary European and UK registries, there was a striking preponderance of women, and REVEAL patients were more likely to be obese. These observations and the difference in HIV-associated PAH between REVEAL and other non-US contemporary registries warrant further investigation.

14598252,"BACKGROUND & AIMS:The epidemiology of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) in the United States is unknown. We report the incidence, clinical spectrum, and outcomes of PSC in Olmsted County, Minnesota. METHODS:Using the Rochester Epidemiology Project, a medical records linkage system in Olmsted County, Minnesota, we identified county residents with PSC, and the diagnosis was confirmed according to clinical, biochemical, radiographic, and histologic criteria. RESULTS:Twenty-two patients met diagnostic criteria for PSC in 1976-2000. The age-adjusted (to 2000 U.S. whites) incidence of PSC in men was 1.25 per 100,000 person-years (95% CI, 0.70 to 2.06) compared with 0.54 per 100,000 person-years (95% CI, 0.22 to 1.12) in women. The prevalence of PSC in 2000 was 20.9 per 100,000 men (95% CI, 9.5 to 32.4) and only 6.3 per 100,000 women (95% CI, 0.1 to 12.5). Seventy-three percent of cases had inflammatory bowel disease, the majority with ulcerative colitis. Survival among PSC patients was significantly less than expected for the Minnesota white population of similar age and gender (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS:These data represent the first population-based estimates of the incidence and prevalence of PSC in the United States. The incidence and prevalence of PSC were approximately one third of those previously described for primary biliary cirrhosis in the same population. Our data suggest that the prevalence of PSC in the United States, with its attendant medical burdens, is significantly greater than previously estimated."

9762961,"The concept of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) is changing rapidly due to the advances in molecular genetics. Recently, seven different gene loci have been described, demonstrating that limb-girdle muscular dystrophy is a heterogeneous syndrome, which includes different diseases with a similar phenotype. In isolated populations which have little genetic exchange with neighbouring populations, an accumulation of cases may be found. We carried out an epidemiological study in Guipúzcoa, a small mountainous Basque province in northern Spain, and found the highest prevalence rate of LGMD described so far: 69 per million. Genetic studies demonstrated that 38 cases corresponded to the LGMD2A type, due to calpain-3 gene mutations. Only one patient with alpha-sarcoglycanopathy was found, and in 12 patients the genetic defect was not identified. Moreover, the particular calpain-3 mutation predominant in Basque chromosomes (exon 22, 2362AG-->TCATCT), has only been rarely found in the rest of the world. This observation strongly suggests a founder effect in the indigenous population of Guipúzcoa. The clinical characteristics of the patients with calpain-3 gene mutations were quite homogeneous and different from the other groups (sarcoglycanopathy and unknown gene defect), allowing for a precise clinical diagnostic. The disease onset was between the ages of 8 and 15 years, in most cases in the pelvic girdle, and the patients became wheelchair-bound between 11 and 28 years after onset. No pseudohypertrophy of calves or contractures were observed. No clear correlations were found between the nature and site of the mutation and the resulting phenotype."
10703781,"OBJECTIVE:Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) is a rare life-threatening cardiomyopathy of unknown cause that occurs in the peripartum period in previously healthy women. In April 1997, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) and the Office of Rare Diseases of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) convened a Workshop on Peripartum Cardiomyopathy to foster a systematic review of information and to develop recommendations for research and education. PARTICIPANTS:Fourteen workshop participants were selected by NHLBI staff and represented cardiovascular medicine, obstetrics, immunology, and pathology. A representative subgroup of 8 participants and NHLBI staff formed the writing group for this article and updated the literature on which the conclusions were based. The workshop was an open meeting, consistent with NIH policy. EVIDENCE:Data presented at the workshop were augmented by a MEDLINE search for English-language articles published from 1966 to July 1999, using the terms peripartum cardiomyopathy, cardiomyopathy, and pregnancy. Articles on the epidemiology, pathogenesis, pathophysiology, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of PPCM were included. RECOMMENDATION PROCESS: After discussion of data presented, workshop participants agreed on a standardized definition of PPCM, a general clinical approach, and the need for a registry to provide an infrastructure for future research. CONCLUSIONS:Peripartum cardiomyopathy is a rare lethal disease about which little is known. Diagnosis is confined to a narrow period and requires echocardiographic evidence of left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Symptomatic patients should receive standard therapy for heart failure, managed by a multidisciplinary team. If subsequent pregnancies occur, they should be managed in collaboration with a high-risk perinatal center. Systematic data collection is required to answer important questions about incidence, treatment, and prognosis."
22133093,"Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) is a severely disabling heritable disorder of connective tissue characterized by congenital malformations of the great toes and progressive heterotopic ossification that forms qualitatively normal bone in characteristic extraskeletal sites. The worldwide prevalence is approximately 1/2,000,000. There is no ethnic, racial, gender, or geographic predilection to FOP. Children who have FOP appear normal at birth except for congenital malformations of the great toes. During the first decade of life, sporadic episodes of painful soft tissue swellings (flare-ups) occur which are often precipitated by soft tissue injury, intramuscular injections, viral infection, muscular stretching, falls or fatigue. These flare-ups transform skeletal muscles, tendons, ligaments, fascia, and aponeuroses into heterotopic bone, rendering movement impossible. Patients with atypical forms of FOP have been described. They either present with the classic features of FOP plus one or more atypical features [FOP plus], or present with major variations in one or both of the two classic defining features of FOP [FOP variants]. Classic FOP is caused by a recurrent activating mutation (617G>A; R206H) in the gene ACVR1/ALK2 encoding Activin A receptor type I/Activin-like kinase 2, a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) type I receptor. Atypical FOP patients also have heterozygous ACVR1 missense mutations in conserved amino acids. The diagnosis of FOP is made by clinical evaluation. Confirmatory genetic testing is available. Differential diagnosis includes progressive osseous heteroplasia, osteosarcoma, lymphedema, soft tissue sarcoma, desmoid tumors, aggressive juvenile fibromatosis, and non-hereditary (acquired) heterotopic ossification. Although most cases of FOP are sporadic (noninherited mutations), a small number of inherited FOP cases show germline transmission in an autosomal dominant pattern. At present, there is no definitive treatment, but a brief 4-day course of high-dose corticosteroids, started within the first 24 hours of a flare-up, may help reduce the intense inflammation and tissue edema seen in the early stages of the disease. Preventative management is based on prophylactic measures against falls, respiratory decline, and viral infections. The median lifespan is approximately 40 years of age. Most patients are wheelchair-bound by the end of the second decade of life and commonly die of complications of thoracic insufficiency syndrome."
8187313,"OBJECTIVE:Although Cushing's disease is a well documented clinical entity, there is no epidemiological information about it. The present study tries to obtain this information. DESIGN AND PATIENTS:Forty-nine patients affected by Cushing's disease living in Vizcaya (Spain) between 1975 and 1992 were considered for an epidemiological study. RESULTS:The prevalence of known cases at the end of 1992 was 39.1 per million inhabitants. The average incidence of newly diagnosed cases was 2.4 cases per million people per year. Cushing's disease was more frequent in women (n = 46) than in men (n = 3), with a ratio of 15:1. Diabetes mellitus and hypertension were observed in 38.7 and 55.1% of patients, respectively. Remission of Cushing's disease was achieved in 36 out of 41 patients (87.5%). In general, the mortality was higher than that expected for the control population (standardized mortality ratio, SMR 3.8, 95% confidence interval, CI 2.5-17.9, P < 0.03). Concerning the cause of death, the SMR of vascular disease was 5 (95% CI 3.4-48.6, P < 0.05). Higher age, persistence of hypertension and abnormalities of glucose metabolism after treatment, were independent predictors of mortality (multivariate analyses, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS:Prevalence of Cushing's disease was 39.1 cases/million inhabitants and average incidence was 2.4 cases/million per year. Mortality was elevated, due to vascular disease, associated with higher age, persistence of hypertension and impaired glucose metabolism."
23981756,"AIM: To describe the epidemiology of biopsy-proven idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM) in South Australia (SA). METHODS: Cases of IIM were ascertained by review of all muscle biopsy reports from the Neuropathology Laboratory, Hanson Institute (wherein all adult muscle biopsies in SA are reported) from 1980 to 2009. Clinical correlation of these patients by review of medical records was undertaken. SA population denominator numbers were obtained from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. RESULTS: Three hundred and fifty-two biopsy-proven cases of IIM were identified between 1980 and 2009. The overall annual incidence of IIM appeared to be rising with a mean incidence of eight cases per million population (95% CI: 7.2-8.9). This corresponded with an increasing annual incidence of inclusion body myositis (IBM) (prevalence of 50.5 cases per million population in 2009, 95% CI: 40.2-62.7). A female preponderance was noted in both dermatomyositis (DM) (F : M = 2.75 : 1.00) and polymyositis (PM) (F : M = 1.55 : 1.00) but gender distribution was almost equal in IBM (F : M = 1.1 : 1.0). Mean age at diagnosis for IBM (67.5 years) was higher than for DM (55.1 years) and PM (59.0 years). A higher proportion of DM patients reported living in urban dwellings and DM patients tended to be predominantly professionals. CONCLUSIONS: In SA there is an increasing incidence of IBM and the prevalence is one of the highest reported to date. This may reflect an increase in the number of biopsies performed, improved histological techniques or a genuine increase in incidence."
15569006,"BACKGROUND: Autoimmune bullous diseases (ABDs) are a rare but significant group of dermatoses that pose great challenges to the treating dermatologist. Most epidemiological studies have focused on a single ABD. Few surveys have been carried out to describe the whole spectrum of ABDs in a region, and no such studies are available from the Arabian Peninsula. OBJECTIVES: To determine the clinico-epidemiological features of various ABDs in Kuwait, and to compare the results with those reported elsewhere. METHODS: A total of 128 cases of ABDs were studied over a span of 11.5 years. The diagnosis in all cases was confirmed by histopathology, and direct and indirect immunofluorescence (IMF). The diagnosis of various subepidermal ABDs was further confirmed by indirect IMF on salt-split skin (SSS) and that of pemphigus by desmoglein 1 and 3 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: Eighty seven per cent of patients were of Arab ethnicity. Pemphigus was observed to be the commonest ABD (47%), followed by pemphigoid (22%), pemphigoid gestationis (PG) (19%), linear IgA bullous disease (LABD) (7%), lichen planus pemphigoides (LPP) (3%), and epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (EBA) (2.3%). The minimum estimated incidence in the local population was 4.6, 2.14, 1.83, 0.69, 0.30, and 0.23 cases per million per year, respectively. Pemphigus patients were observed to have a younger age of onset (36.50 +/- 11.36 years) than reported elsewhere. BP, although the second commonest ABD, was less prevalent than in Europe and Singapore, and BP patients were observed to have a striking female predominance (85%). The prevalence of PG was much higher than that reported elsewhere. LABD was the fourth commonest ABD, and 89% of patients were children. CONCLUSIONS: The study suggests that similar surveys from different regions would expand our understanding of ABD."
14638881,"OBJECTIVE:To describe the occurrence of myasthenia gravis in the Baltic area. METHODS:Data were obtained from hospital files recorded during the period 1942 to 1996 from neurologists and the patient organisation. Survival data were checked with the Estonian Citizenship and Migration Board. Prevalence was determined on 1 January 1997. A questionnaire on the course of myasthenia gravis was sent to all the prevalent patients. RESULTS:The size of the population surveyed was 1 462 130. The average annual incidence from 1970 to 1996 was 4.0 per million (women, 5.2; men, 2.6). The point prevalence was 99 per million (women, 133; men 59). The incidence in the younger age group (<50 years) was 3.4 per million (women, 4.8; men, 1.9) and in the older age group (>or=50 years), 5.5 (women, 5.9; men, 4.9). The prevalence ratio was twofold higher in the older age group (p<0.0001)-for men (p = 0.034) as well as for women (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS:Prevalence and incidence values of myasthenia gravis from Estonia are similar to those reported in most studies from Europe and north America. However, there seems to be a higher frequency in the elderly (>or=50 years) in Estonia."
15826889,"The most common major birth defects affecting the oesophagus and trachea are oesophageal atresia (OA) and tracheo-oesophageal fistula (TOF). Epidemiological information on OA and/or TOF in the USA has been derived from only a few populations. Sixty-one cases of OA or TOF were identified through a population-based birth defects registry in Hawaii during 1986-2000. The relationship between various clinical and demographic factors and OA or TOF were examined. The rate of OA or TOF was 2.2 per 10,000 live births. The cases were 67.2% OA with TOF, 21.3% TOF alone, and 11.5% OA alone. Risk of OA or TOF was significantly higher among multiple births and live births with low birth weight and gestational age. The risk of OA or TOF was significantly higher for whites. The rate of OA or TOF was consistent with that reported elsewhere. The risk of the defects differed significantly between the major racial/ethnic groups in Hawaii. The impact of many factors on OA or TOF in Hawaii was similar to that reported elsewhere."
17300999,"We aimed to establish the population prevalence of the MELAS 3243A>G mtDNA mutation in a large Caucasian-based population (n=2954; 99% Caucasian, 57% women and mean age of 66.4 years). All participants underwent comprehensive clinical evaluation including audiologic testing. We detected the 3243A>G mutation in seven subjects using standard polymerase chain reaction/restriction fragment length polymorphism methods, establishing a population prevalence of 236/100000 (0.24%; 95% CI 0.10-0.49%); much higher than previously reported. All had mild to moderate hearing loss. Our findings indicate that subjects with the 3243A>G mtDNA mutation could be markedly under-recognised in the community."
18681890,"AIM: The aim of this study was to estimate the incidence and prevalence of mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS disorders) in Scandinavia. METHODS: The retrospective period used for the incidence study covered the period from 1975 to 2004 in Sweden and Denmark and from 1979 to 2004 in Norway. Prevalence was derived from the number of MPS patients alive as of December 31, 2007. RESULTS: The incidence of all MPS disorders was 1.75 cases in Sweden, 3.08 cases in Norway and 1.77 cases in Denmark per 100 000 newborns. The incidence of MPS I was the most common in all three countries, with 0.67, 1.85 and 0.54 cases per 100 000 newborns, respectively; for MPS II, numbers were 0.27, 0.13 and 0.27, respectively. For patients with other MPS disorders the incidence varied widely. The prevalence for all MPS disorders was 4.24, 7.06 and 6.03 per 1 000 000 inhabitants in Sweden, Norway and Denmark, respectively. CONCLUSION: From three Scandinavian countries the incidence of MPS disorders is retrospectively evaluated for 25 years in Norway and 30 years in Sweden and Denmark. Incidence and prevalence studies of lysosomal disorders are prerequisites for cost benefit calculations in the face of newly developed and expensive therapies in the future."
20073554,"Acute lung injury (ALI) remains a significant source of morbidity and mortality in the critically ill patient population. Defined by a constellation of clinical criteria (acute onset of bilateral pulmonary infiltrates with hypoxemia without evidence of hydrostatic pulmonary edema), ALI has a high incidence (200,000 per year in the US) and overall mortality remains high. Pathogenesis of ALI is explained by injury to both the vascular endothelium and alveolar epithelium. Recent advances in the understanding of pathophysiology have identified several biologic markers that are associated with worse clinical outcomes. Phase III clinical trials by the NHLBI ARDS Network have resulted in improvement in survival and a reduction in the duration of mechanical ventilation with a lung-protective ventilation strategy and fluid conservative protocol. Potential areas of future treatments include nutritional strategies, statin therapy, and mesenchymal stem cells."
15056409,"Thirteen cases of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) were diagnosed from 1990 to 2003 in the area of the Hospital de Sagunto (Valencia, Spain), which attends a population of 112,003 inhabitants aged more than 14 years (54,622 males and 57,381 females). The diagnostic criteria of the International Autoimmune Hepatitis Group were used and patients who, despite having a probable diagnosis of AIH, presented hepatitis C virus infection were excluded. The diagnosis was probable in one patient and definitive in 12. All patients, 11 females and two males aged 45.9 12.2 years (range: 28-66), were classified as AIH type 1. Among the population aged more than 14 years, the mean annual incidence of AIH was 0.83 cases/100,000 inhabitants (95% CI, 0.44-1.42) (range: 0-2.68), showing a significant trend to increase (b = 0.132; p = 0.019). The incidence was higher in women than in men (RR = 5.24; 95% CI, 1.16-23.62). The mean annual incidence was 1.37 (95% CI, 0.68-2.46) (range: 0-3,49) in women and was 0.26 (95% CI, 0.02-0.96) (range: 0-1.83) in men. By age, the maximum mean annual incidence was observed in the group aged 55-64 years (1.6 cases/100,000 inhabitants). The prevalence of AIH in September 2003 was 11.61 cases/100,000 inhabitants aged more than 14 years (95% CI, 6.78-19.86). The prevalence was 3.66 (95% CI, 1-13.35) in men and was 19.17 (95% CI, 10.70-34.33) in women."
18027113,"Primary fallopian tube carcinoma (PFTC) is rare, constituting about 1% of female genital tract malignancies, and little is known about its etiological, protective, risk or prognostic factors. Earlier, such factors were thought to be similar to those seen in ovarian cancer. The incidence of PFTC has been rising during the last decades, especially in higher social classes and among women in certain occupations. Parity is a strong protective factor for PFTC, with a lower incidence associated with an increasing number of deliveries. Previous sterilisation seems to offer some protection. Earlier suggestions of previous genital infections as risk factors appear not to hold. Previous cancers are frequent among PFTC patients, especially breast cancer. Second primary cancers after PFTC are also frequent, especially non-lymphoid leukemia, colorectal, breast, bladder and lung cancer. Only 4% of primary fallopian carcinomas are correctly diagnosed before operation. Treatment consists of aggressive cytoreductive surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy with a platinum-taxane combination. A high preoperative serum hCGss is a strong prognostic factor for worse prognosis. The 5-year survival rates vary between 22 and 57%."
21649801,"The objectives of this article were to study the reported prevalence of haemophilia B (HB) on a country-by-country basis and to analyse whether the prevalence of HB varied by national economy. The prevalence of HB is the proportion of diagnosed, reported cases of HB in a population at a specific point of time. We collected data on the HB prevalence for 105 countries from the World Federation of Hemophilia annual global surveys. Our results showed that the HB prevalence varied considerably among countries, even among the wealthiest of countries. The HB prevalence (per 100 000 males) for the highest income countries was 2.69 ± 1.61 (mean ± SD), whereas the prevalence for the rest of the world was 1.20 ± 1.33 (mean ± SD). Ireland had the highest reported HB prevalence of 8.07 per 100 000 males. There was a strong trend of increasing HB prevalence (per 100 000 males) over time. Prevalence data reported from the WFH compared well with prevalence data from the literature. The WFH annual global surveys have some limitations, but they are the best available source of worldwide haemophilia data. Prevalence data are extremely valuable information for the planning efforts of national healthcare agencies in setting priorities and allocating resources for the treatment of HB."
1937486,"Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean is a geographically isolated region located in northeastern Quebec. Opened to the white settlement in 1938, its immigrants mainly came from Charlevoix, another isolated region of Quebec. The prevalence and/or incidence of several autosomal dominant and recessive disorders are very high. The overall birth prevalence of the recessive disorders was calculated at 1/207 living births and the overall carrier rate at 1/7 inhabitants. This situation may be explained by migration and social factors."
19170813,"BACKGROUND: Only limited epidemiologic data are available on autoimmune bullous diseases. Improved diagnostic tools should have led to an increased incidence. To test this hypothesis, all patients with autoimmune bullous disorders who were treated in the Department of Dermatology at the University of Würzburg, Germany, between January 2001 and June 2002 were analysed prospectively. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Epidemiologic data of patients diagnosed with an autoimmune bullous disease during this time period were registered and statistically evaluated. Diagnosis was based on the clinical picture and specific immunopathological findings. Only patients from Lower Franconia, a well-defined administrative region of Southern Germany, were included into this study. RESULTS: During the study period, 41 patients with an autoimmune bullous disease were diagnosed, including 27 with bullous pemphigoid, 4 with pemphigoid gestationis and mucous membrane pemphigoid, 2 with dermatitis herpetiformis and linear IgA disease, and 1 with epidermolysis bullosa acquisita and pemphigus vulgaris, respectively. The highest incidence was calculated for bullous pemphigoid (13.4 per 1 million inhabitants per year) followed by pemphigoid gestationis (2.0) and mucous membrane pemphigoid (2.0). Patients with mucous membrane pemphigoid were found to have the highest mean age at disease onset (76 years) followed by patients with bullous pemphigoid (74 years). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first prospective study on the incidence of autoimmune bullous disorders. Subepidermal blistering autoimmune diseases were shown to be more frequent than previously reported for Central Europe. This is most likely due to improved diagnostic tools for and increased awareness of these diseases."
16634037,"OBJECTIVES: The prevalence of limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2I (LGMD2I) in northern Europe is unknown. We investigated this and the genotype-phenotype relation in LGMD2I. METHODS: Prospective clinical and molecular screening of 118 Danish patients registered with LGMD was performed to divide patients into LGMD subtypes. RESULTS: One hundred three patients fulfilled the clinical criteria for LGMD2. Thirty-eight had LGMD2I (27 homozygous, 11 compound heterozygous for 826C>A), 23 had sarcoglycanopathy, 2 dysferlinopathy, 12 calpainopathy, and 4 Becker muscular dystrophy. The 24 patients with no molecular diagnosis did not harbor fukutin-related protein gene (FKRP) mutations. A clear clinical delineation was found between patients homozygous and compound heterozygous for the 826C>A mutation. Homozygous patients had later debut, milder clinical progression, and less muscle weakness compared with compound heterozygous patients, who were all wheelchair bound by their mid-20s. Impaired cardiac pump function was found in both groups. INTERPRETATION: This study reports a different distribution of LGMD subtypes in Denmark than seen in other geographic regions, with a threefold to fourfold higher prevalence of LGMD2I than elsewhere. The findings support a clear clinical delineation between patients homozygous and compound heterozygous for the 826C>A mutation in FKRP. The findings suggest that, in the studied region, screening for the 826C>A mutation will identify all persons with LGMD2I."
19326483,"Metopic synostosis is thought to have an incidence of about 1 in 15,000 births. Traditionally, this makes it the third most frequent single-suture craniosynostosis, after scaphocephaly (1 in 4200-8500) and plagiocephaly (1 in 11,000). Our units have, independently from each other, noted a marked increase in the number of metopic synostosis over the recent years. This is a pan-European, retrospective epidemiological study on the number of cases with metopic synostosis born between January 1, 1997, and January 1, 2006. This number was compared to the prevalence of scaphocephaly, the most frequently seen craniosynostosis. In the 7 units, a total of 3240 craniosynostosis were seen from 1997 until 2006. Forty-one percent (n = 1344) of those were sagittal synostosis, and 23% (n = 756) were metopic synostosis. There was a significant increase of the absolute number as well as of the percentage of metopic synostosis over these years (regression analysis, P = 0.017, R2 = 0.578) as opposed to a nonsignificant increase in the percentage of sagittal synostosis (P > 0.05, R2 = 0.368). The most remarkable increase occurred around 2000-2001, with the average of metopics being 20.1% from 1997 to 2000 and 25.5% from 2001 to 2005 (independent t-test, P = 0.002). The sagittal synostosis showed a smaller and nonsignificant increase in the same years: from 39.9% in 1997-2000 leading up to 42.5% in 2001-2005 (independent t-test, P > 0.05). The number of metopic synostosis has significantly increased over the reviewed period in all of our units, both in absolute numbers as in comparison to the total number of craniosynostosis."
17990338,"BACKGROUND: Bladder exstrophy (BE) and cloacal exstrophy (CE) are rare birth defects that have been reported to occur in 1:30,000-50,000 and 1:200,000-400,000 live births. Disagreement exists as to whether they comprise two distinct disorders or are part of a spectrum. We examined epidemiologic trends and risk factors for BE and CE in a large population-based dataset. METHODS: Potential cases were identified in the New York State (NYS) Congenital Malformations Registry. When nonspecific codes for CE were reported, narrative descriptions were reviewed for classification. Birth certificate data were analyzed with descriptive statistics and Poisson regression was used to calculate crude (PR) and adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: In NYS from 1983 through 1999, 95 BE cases and 29 CE cases were identified for a live-birth prevalence of 2.1 and 0.6 per 100,000 live births. BE showed a statistically significant downward linear trend by year. Factors associated with BE included summer conception (vs. winter, aPR 2.46, CI 1.19-5.10), white, non-Hispanic maternal race/ethnicity (vs. black non-Hispanic, aPR 3.20, CI 1.20-8.52), and male sex (female vs. male, aPR 0.53, CI 0.33-0.87). Factors associated with CE included preterm low birth weight birth (aPR 14.55, CI 5.28-40.07), multiple birth (aPR 6.68, CI 1.19-23.27), non-New York City residence (aPR 3.27, CI 1.04-10.22), and female sex (aPR 2.57, CI 1.00-6.64). Infant mortality was greater in the CE group. CONCLUSIONS: The epidemiology suggests different risk factor patterns for BE and CE. Classification of BE and CE is difficult due to the nonspecific coding."
21906764,"OBJECTIVE: Tuberculosis and sarcoidosis are chronic granulomatous diseases. Clinical, pathologic and immunologic aspects are similar although different. The authors were interested to highlight possible epidemiological similarities of these two granulomatous diseases. The objective of this study was to evaluate incidence rate as well as age, sex and geographic distribution of sarcoidosis in South Croatia and to compare it with these epidemiological characteristics of tuberculosis. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective. METHODS: The study was including ten years follow up period (1997-2006), and was performed in Split-Dalmatia County, Croatia. All data were collected retrospectively and analyzed using Statistica 7 programme. RESULTS: The mean annual incidence of sarcoidosis was 3.3/100,000 inhabitants with a mean of 15,6 cases per year. Woman accounted for 61% of all sarcoidosis cases. The mean sarcoidosis patient age was 44.94 ± 11.85 years. The peak age group was 40-49 years (31%). Significant difference according to incidence rate on the islands comparing to the rates on the coast and the mainland was observed (P = 0.003). The mean sarcoidosis mortality rate was 1.2/100,000. Statistically significant differences between sarcoidosis and tuberculosis were observed according the higher number of tuberculosis patients (P < 0.000), among males (P < 0.000), and females, too (P < 0.000) as well as in mortality rates (P = 0.401). Significantly more patients had tuberculosis on the mainland (P < 0.000) and on the coast (P < 0.000), but not in the islands (P = 0.260). CONCLUSIONS: The results from this study showed dissimilarities in classic epidemiological patterns between sarcoidosis and tuberculosis, incidence rates, as well as sex and geographic distribution. Our findings resulted from this study might be starting point for the future epidemiological, genetic, and immunological studies."
8463510,"Histidemia, first described by Ghadimi in 1961, is caused by a defect in histidase. The defect results in elevated urinary excretion of histidine and its transamination products, and in high blood histidine. Blood histidine levels in histidinemic patients range from 290 to 1420 microM (normal 70-120 microM). The clinical picture of histidinemia varies from complete normality to severe retardation, with many patients being asymptomatic. No correlation has been found between clinical and biochemical data. Most reported cases have been identified in newborn screening programs. Frequency of histidinemia ranges from 1 in 8000 (Japan) to 1 in 37,000 (Sweden). Histidinemia is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Maternal histidinemia is believed to be benign. Studies in animal models have shown similar metabolic changes in animals and humans, but clinical changes differ. Histidinemia may be treated with a low-histidine diet, which reduces elevated histidine levels, although in most cases no improvement of clinical symptoms has been observed."
19710046,"BACKGROUND:Geographical differences in the incidence of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) have been reported in the literature but comparisons across previous studies are limited by different methods in case ascertainment and by the relatively small size of the studied populations. To address these issues, the authors undertook a pooled analysis of European population based ALS registries. METHODS:All new incident ALS cases in subjects aged 18 years old and older were identified prospectively in six population based registries in three European countries (Ireland, UK and Italy) in the 2 year period 1998-1999, with a reference population of almost 24 million. RESULTS:Based on 1028 identified incident cases, the crude annual incidence rate of ALS in the general European population was 2.16 per 100 000 person years; 95% CI 2.0 to 2.3), with similar incidence rates across all registries. The incidence was higher among men (3.0 per 100 000 person years; 95% CI 2.8 to 3.3) than among women (2.4 per 100 000 person years; 95% CI 2.2 to 2.6). Spinal onset ALS was more common among men compared with women, particularly in the 70-80 year age group. Disease occurrence decreased rapidly after 80 years of age. CONCLUSIONS:ALS incidence is homogeneous across Europe. Sex differences in incidence may be explained by the higher incidence of spinal onset ALS among men, and the age related disease pattern suggests that ALS occurs within a susceptible group within the population rather than being a disease of ageing."
25320104,"OBJECTIVE: The two major histological types of oesophageal cancer--adenocarcinoma (AC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)--are known to differ greatly in terms of risk factors and epidemiology. To date, global incidence estimates for individual subtypes are still lacking. This study for the first time quantified the global burden of oesophageal cancer by histological subtype. DESIGN: Where available, data from Cancer Incidence in Five Continents Vol. X (CI5X) were used to compute, age-specific, sex-specific and country-specific proportions of AC and SCC. Nine regional averages were computed for countries without CI5X data. The proportions were then applied to all oesophageal cancer cases from GLOBOCAN 2012 and age-standardised incidence rates calculated for both histological types. RESULTS: Worldwide, an estimated 398,000 SCCs and 52,000 ACs of the oesophagus occurred in 2012, translating to incidence rates of 5.2 and 0.7 per 100,000, respectively. Although SCCs were most common in South-Eastern and Central Asia (79% of the total global SCC cases), the highest burden of AC was found in Northern and Western Europe, Northern America and Oceania (46% of the total global AC cases). Men had substantially higher incidence than women, especially in the case of AC (male to female ratio AC: 4.4; SCC: 2.7). CONCLUSIONS: These first global estimates of oesophageal cancer incidence by histology suggested a high concentration of AC in high-income countries with men being at much greater risk. This quantification of incidence will aid health policy makers to plan appropriate cancer control measures in the future."
22480138,"Previous studies on the prevalence of mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) in different populations have shown considerable variations. There are, however, few data with regard to the prevalence of MPSs in Fenno-Ugric populations or in north-eastern Europe, except for a report about Scandinavian countries. A retrospective epidemiological study of MPSs in Estonia was undertaken, and live-birth prevalence of MPS patients born between 1985 and 2006 was estimated. The live-birth prevalence for all MPS subtypes was found to be 4.05 per 100,000 live births, which is consistent with most other European studies. MPS II had the highest calculated incidence, with 2.16 per 100,000 live births (4.2 per 100,000 male live births), forming 53% of all diagnosed MPS cases, and was twice as high as in other studied European populations. The second most common subtype was MPS IIIA, with a live-birth prevalence of 1.62 in 100,000 live births. With 0.27 out of 100,000 live births, MPS VI had the third-highest live-birth prevalence. No cases of MPS I were diagnosed in Estonia, making the prevalence of MPS I in Estonia much lower than in other European populations. MPSs are the third most frequent inborn error of metabolism in Estonia after phenylketonuria and galactosemia."
22481200,"BACKGROUND: Inborn errors of metabolism are neglected in developing countries because they are not as common as infectious and nutritional disorders. In Tunisia, no information is available on the incidence and epidemiological features of these inherited metabolic diseases. AIMS: To precise the profile of aminoacidopathies other than phenylketonuria and organic acidurias and to estimate their incidences in Tunisia. METHODS: Between 1987 and 2009, our laboratory received 13171 requests for analysis of patients with symptoms suggestive of inborn errors of metabolism. For these cases, ion exchange chromatography of free amino acids was performed on amino acids analyser. Urinary organic acids profiles were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Abnormal cases were 370 (2.8%), divided into 212 cases of aminoacidopathies (57.3%) and 158 cases of organic acidurias (42.7%). The most frequent aminoacidopathies, were maple syrup disease (32.5%), tyrosinemia type I (28.8%) and nonketotic hyperglycinemia (16%). Methylmalonic aciduria (33.5%), propionic aciduria (18.4%) and 2-hyrdoxy glutaric aciduria (10.8%) were the most frequent organic acidurias. The incidences were calculated using the Hardy-Weinberg formula and were estimated at 1/13716 for maple syrup disease, 1/14804 for tyrosinemia type I, 1/16144 for methylmalonic aciduria and 1/23176 for propionic aciduria. CONCLUSION: Aminoacidopathies and organic acidurias turned out to be highly frequent in Tunisia, mainly because of a high rate of consanguinity. We believe that they are underestimated. To improve their diagnosis, it is necessary to have available sophisticated equipment which would allow early treatment of patients."

24193082,"Glioblastomas and malignant gliomas are the most common primary malignant brain tumors, with an annual incidence of 5.26 per 100,000 population or 17,000 new diagnoses per year. These tumors are typically associated with a dismal prognosis and poor quality of life.To review the clinical management of malignant gliomas, including genetic and environmental risk factors such as cell phones, diagnostic pitfalls, symptom management, specific antitumor therapy, and common complications.Search of PubMed references from January 2000 to May 2013 using the terms glioblastoma, glioma, malignant glioma, anaplastic astrocytoma, anaplastic oligodendroglioma, anaplastic oligoastrocytoma, and brain neoplasm. Articles were also identified through searches of the authors' own files. Evidence was graded using the American Heart Association classification system.Only radiation exposure and certain genetic syndromes are well-defined risk factors for malignant glioma. The treatment of newly diagnosed glioblastoma is based on radiotherapy combined with temozolomide. This approach doubles the 2-year survival rate to 27%, but overall prognosis remains poor. Bevacizumab is an emerging treatment alternative that deserves further study. Grade III tumors have been less well studied, and clinical trials to establish standards of care are ongoing. Patients with malignant gliomas experience frequent clinical complications, including thromboembolic events, seizures, fluctuations in neurologic symptoms, and adverse effects from corticosteroids and chemotherapies that require proper management and prophylaxis.Glioblastoma remains a difficult cancer to treat, although therapeutic options have been improving. Optimal management requires a multidisciplinary approach and knowledge of potential complications from both the disease and its treatment."
23424026,"UNLABELLED:Cholesteryl ester storage disease (CESD) and Wolman disease are autosomal recessive later-onset and severe infantile disorders, respectively, which result from the deficient activity of lysosomal acid lipase (LAL). LAL is encoded by LIPA (10q23.31) and the most common mutation associated with CESD is an exon 8 splice junction mutation (c.894G>A; E8SJM), which expresses only ∼3%-5% of normally spliced LAL. However, the frequency of c.894G>A is unknown in most populations. To estimate the prevalence of CESD in different populations, the frequencies of the c.894G>A mutation were determined in 10,000 LIPA alleles from healthy African-American, Asian, Caucasian, Hispanic, and Ashkenazi Jewish individuals from the greater New York metropolitan area and 6,578 LIPA alleles from African-American, Caucasian, and Hispanic subjects enrolled in the Dallas Heart Study. The combined c.894G>A allele frequencies from the two cohorts ranged from 0.0005 (Asian) to 0.0017 (Caucasian and Hispanic), which translated to carrier frequencies of 1 in 1,000 to ∼1 in 300, respectively. No African-American heterozygotes were detected. Additionally, by surveying the available literature, c.894G>A was estimated to account for 60% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 51%-69%) of reported mutations among multiethnic CESD patients. Using this estimate, the predicted prevalence of CESD in the Caucasian and Hispanic populations is ∼0.8 per 100,000 (∼1 in 130,000; 95% CI: ∼1 in 90,000 to 1 in 170,000). CONCLUSION:These data indicate that CESD may be underdiagnosed in the general Caucasian and Hispanic populations, which is important since clinical trials of enzyme replacement therapy for LAL deficiency are currently being developed. Moreover, future studies on CESD prevalence in African and Asian populations may require full-gene LIPA sequencing to determine heterozygote frequencies, since c.894G>A is not common in these racial groups."
10419881,"With the aim of determining the incidence of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) in adults, we searched all adult ITP patients diagnosed from April 1, 1973 to December 31, 1995 in the County of Funen in Denmark. This county comprises 9% of the total Danish adult population. A total of 221 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria, yielding an annual standardized incidence rate of 2.68 per 100,000. The median age of the patient population was 56 years, and the female to male ratio was 1.7. Changing the platelet count cut-off point from 100 x 10(9)/L to 50 x 10(9)/L changed the incidence rate to 2.25 per 100,000. Comparing patients less and more than 60 years old, the incidence rate more than doubled and the sex difference was eliminated in the older age group. These two age groups were almost identical regarding platelet count at diagnosis and number of asymptomatic cases. The incidence rate increased in the study period. This increase in particular involved asymptomatic patients and old males who were both symptomatic or not symptomatic. Including additional patients identified by a questionnaire study of the contribution from the primary care physicians and the practicing specialists in the second half of the study period, a reliable estimate of the annual ITP incidence in Danish adults, using a platelet concentration cut-off point of 50 x 10(9)/L, is 3.2 per 100, 000 persons."
16263546,"Primary fallopian tube carcinoma (PFTC) is rare but may be under-diagnosed. We have analysed the incidence, clinical findings and outcome in patients with PFTC at the RUH Gynaecological Cancer Centre in Bath between 1999 and 2004, and compared the incidence with that of advanced ovarian carcinoma (OC). Eight patients had PFTC, seven of whom were diagnosed after 2001, and 55 patients had advanced OC. Our data suggest a relative increase in the number of patients with PFTC over the study period. PFTC patients had a mean age of 69.6 years, most presented with postmenopausal bleeding, two had a second carcinoma, three were nulliparous and none were diagnosed pre-operatively. All were treated surgically and received platinum-based chemotherapy. Although PFTC patients had better outcomes than those with advanced OC, the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.088). Accurate diagnosis and differentiation of PFTC from advanced OC are important for monitoring trends in incidence, for better characterisation of prognostic features and improved management."
11156552,"OBJECTIVE:The aetiopathogenesis of the primary systemic vasculitides (PSV) is unknown but includes both environmental and genetic factors. The development of classification criteria/definitions for PSV allows comparison of the epidemiology between different regions. METHODS:The same methods and the American College of Rheumatology (1990) criteria or Chapel Hill definitions were used to compare the epidemiology of Wegener's granulomatosis, Churg-Strauss syndrome, microscopic polyangiitis, and polyarteritis nodosa in Norwich (east England population 413 500) and Lugo (northwest Spain population 204 100). Patients with PSV were identified between 1 January 1988 and 31 December 1998. RESULTS:Overall, the incidence of PSV in adults was almost equal in Norwich (18.9/million) and Spain (18.3/million). The incidence of Wegener's granulomatosis in Norwich (10.6/million) was greater than in Spain (4.9/million). There was a marked age-specific increase in incidence in Norwich with a peak age 65-74 years (52.9/million), but a virtually equal age distribution between ages 45 and 74 in Lugo (34.1/million). There was no significant increase with time in either population, or evidence of cyclical changes in incidence. CONCLUSION:These data support the suggestion that environmental factors may be important in the pathogenesis of PSV."
22790789,"BACKGROUND:Fabry disease (FD) is a rare X-linked lysosomal storage disorder and is included in the Specified Disease Treatment Research Program in Japan, which subsidizes medical care for beneficiaries with rare and other, designated diseases. However, no report on the epidemiologic features of Fabry disease has been published in Japan. METHODS:We used clinical research data reports submitted to the program between 2003 and 2008 to assess the epidemiologic features of 315 beneficiaries with FD. RESULTS:Of the 315 program beneficiaries, 198 were men (mean age, 37.4 years) and 117 were women (mean age, 51.2 years). The overall incidence in Japan was 0.25 cases per 100,000 individuals, and prevalence among men was 1.78 times that among women. More than 80% of beneficiaries were capable of working, going to school, or doing housework; however, 46 beneficiaries (14.6%) required home care, and 9 (2.9%) were living in hospitals or other medical facilities. As compared with the previous year, the clinical course of FD at beneficiary registration was unchanged for 178 of 290 beneficiaries (61.4%), worse for 81 (27.9%), and improved or cured for 31 (10.7%). The distribution of beneficiary-related characteristics was similar between men and women, and no significant difference was observed. CONCLUSIONS:The high percentage (>80%) of individuals with FD who were able to work, attend school, and perform tasks such as housework could reflect an improvement in the clinical course of FD after enzyme replacement therapy. We must continue data collection and conduct further studies to improve our understanding of the descriptive epidemiology of FD."
11810294,"Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is associated with the expansion of a GAA trinucleotide repeat in the first intron of the frataxin (X25) gene. Worldwide it is considered to be the most common form of hereditary ataxia, but it is infrequently encountered in Finland. We have performed the first epidemiological study on the frequency of FRDA in Finland by combining results from a nationwide clinical survey and a molecular carrier testing study. Haplotype analysis was performed for the Finnish FRDA patients and the distribution of frataxin gene GAA repeats was analyzed in controls. In the general population of Finland, the carrier frequency was only 1 in 500, corresponding to a birth incidence of 1 in 10(6). In the more sparsely populated Northern Finland the carrier frequency was five times higher and also four out of the seven Finnish FRDA patients originated from this region. Haplotype analysis revealed the major universal risk haplotype in all the investigated patients. Alleles in the uppermost end of the normal variation (28-36 GAA) were totally missing in the Finnish population. The relative enrichment of the FRDA mutation in the north probably dates back to the internal migration movement and inhabitation of northern Finland in the 1500s. Breaking down the epidemiology of FRDA into clinical and molecular components brings along the possibility of providing more reliable and population-based genetic counseling and recurrence risk estimations."
3087206,"We have studied 23 patients with Rett syndrome with particular reference to the character and natural history of the clinical disorder. We found a prevalence of 0.8 per 10,000 girls 0-14 years in the region from which cases came. We consider that the disorder of tone, posture and movement is extrapyramidal in nature and suggest that the gradual emergence of its fully developed pattern leads to the familiar regression in skills on presentation. We have not found proof of dementia at this stage but rather of severe mental handicap."
6468444,"A nationwide neonatal screening program for phenylketonuria (PKU), maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), homocystinuria, histidinemia and galactosemia was started in Japan in 1977. The total number of infants screened had reached 6,311,754 by March, 1982. A follow-up study revealed the incidence of the disease in Japan: 1/108,823 for PKU; 1/450,840 for hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA); 1/1,577,939 for biopterin deficiency; 1/525,980 for MSUD; 1/1,051,959 for homocystinuria; 1/8,371 for histidinemia, and 1/788,969 for galactosemia type 1. The incidences of PKU, HPA, homocystinuria, and galactosemia (type 1) were found to be markedly low in Japan as compared with those in Caucasian countries. There was no great difference in the incidence of MSUD between both. On the other hand, the incidence of histidinemia was higher in Japan. It was found that most of the patients with PKU, HPA, MSUD, homocystinuria, or galactosemia are developing normally due to the early initiation of dietary treatment. These results clearly indicate that the neonatal mass screening program plays a great role in preventing the occurrence of handicapped children."
19423368,"The incidence, mode of presentation and management of Dancing Eye Syndrome/Opsoclonus-Myoclonus Syndrome (DES/OMS) was prospectively evaluated in 20 United Kingdom (UK) paediatric neurology centres by questionnaire over a 24-month period between 2003 and 2005. Nineteen children were notified, giving an incidence of 0.18 cases per million total population per year. Mean age at presentation was 18 months (range 3-42 months). Fifteen families consented to participate in the study. Atypical features were present in 6/15 cases including very delayed presentation of opsoclonus, dysphagia, and rapid spontaneous improvement without treatment. Only 4/15 cases were associated with neuroblastoma (NB) but current practice in excluding this is diverse and a standardised approach is suggested."
22133539,"BACKGROUND: The interest in neonatal screening for lysosomal storage disorders has increased substantially because of newly developed enzyme replacement therapies, the need for early diagnosis, and technical advances. We tested for Gaucher's disease, Pompe's disease, Fabry's disease, and Niemann-Pick disease types A and B in an anonymous prospective nationwide screening study that included genetic mutation analysis to assess the practicality and appropriateness of including these disorders in neonatal screening panels. METHODS: Specimens from dried blood spots of 34,736 newborn babies were collected consecutively from January, 2010 to July, 2010, as part of the national routine Austrian newborn screening programme. Anonymised samples were analysed for enzyme activities of acid β-glucocerebrosidase, α-galactosidase, α-glucosidase, and acid sphingomyelinase by electrospray ionisation tandem mass spectrometry. Genetic mutation analyses were done in samples with suspected enzyme deficiency. FINDINGS: All 34,736 samples were analysed successfully by the multiplex screening assay. Low enzyme activities were detected in 38 babies. Mutation analysis confirmed lysosomal storage disorders in 15 of them. The most frequent mutations were found for Fabry's disease (1 per 3859 births), followed by Pompe's disease (1 per 8684), and Gaucher's disease (1 per 17,368). The positive predictive values were 32% (95% CI 16-52), 80% (28-99), and 50% (7-93), respectively. Mutational analysis detected predominantly missense mutations associated with a late-onset phenotype. INTERPRETATION: The combined overall proportion of infants carrying a mutation for lysosomal storage disorders was higher than expected. Neonatal screening for lysosomal storage disorders is likely to raise challenges for primary health-care providers. Furthermore, the high frequency of late-onset mutations makes lysosomal storage disorders a broad health problem beyond childhood. FUNDING: Austrian Ministry of Health, Family, and Women."
22796417,"We aimed to investigate the epidemiological determinants, clinical features, and genetic pattern of FOP in our country by evaluating the entire population of patients identified according to a combination of methods. To achieve this, 24 individuals were confirmed as FOP cases, 17 of whom were alive at the end of 2011 (point prevalence=0.36 × 10(-6)). The gender distribution (male/female ratio=13/11) and the concurrent range of ages (from 4 to 53 years; mean ± SD: 30.2 ± 13.8) are in agreement with similar reports. Twenty-one (87.5%) had characteristic congenital malformations of the big toe, and short thumbs were found in 65.2% of cases. In addition, other skeletal malformations such us fusion of the posterior elements of the cervical spine (89.0%), knee osteochondromas (71%), scoliosis (54.5%), and short and broad femoral neck (52.6%) were observed. All had developed mature ossicles of heterotopic bone in typical anatomic and temporal patterns, ranging in number from 1 to 17 (9.5 ± 3.9). Age at appearance of first ossifying lesion varied from 3 months to 15 years. Mean age at diagnosis was 7.3 ± 5.1 years and the average delay in reaching the correct diagnosis after the onset of heterotopic ossification was 2.7 years (range=0-12 years). Biopsy of the pre-osseous lesions was performed in 11 of 20 (55.0%), providing no useful information for the diagnosis of FOP. Seven of 18 (38.9%) reported some hearing loss, and 5 (27.8%) experienced diffuse thinning of the hair or were bald. No patient had relatives with a typical FOP clinical picture. Fourteen of the 16 cases which were genetically investigated displayed the single heterozygous mutation c.617G>A in exon 4 of the ACVR1 gene. One of the two patients who did not present with the canonical ACVR1 mutation showed a heterozygous mutation c.774G>C in exon 5 leading to the substitution of Arginine 258 with a serine. The other patient had a heterozygous c.774G>T substitution in exon 5 leading to the same amino acid change (p.Arg258Ser). These two patients had only nonspecific abnormalities of the great toe, lacked the typical anatomic and developmental pattern of heterotopic ossification, and shared a trend toward uncommon clinical features. These results provide new insight on the epidemiological and clinical traits of FOP, reinforcing the notion of its worldwide homogeneity. The molecular characterization of ACVR1 sequence variation will contribute to the understanding of the genetic profile of this devastating disease in different geographical areas."
20083689,"To identify new and existing cases of dermatomyositis and its subtypes in Olmsted County, Minnesota, from 1976 through 2007, and to establish a population-based estimate of the incidence and prevalence of dermatomyositis and amyopathic dermatomyositis.Retrospective population-based study.Community-based epidemiology project. Patients Patients with a diagnosis of dermatomyositis were identified from the Rochester Epidemiology Project.Incidence of dermatomyositis and clinically amyopathic dermatomyositis and risk of malignancy in clinically amyopathic dermatomyositis.Of the 29 patients identified, 6 (21%) had the clinically amyopathic subtype of dermatomyositis and 22 (76%) were female. Overall age- and sex-adjusted incidence of dermatomyositis including all subtypes was 9.63 (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.09-13.17) per 1 million persons and 2.08 (95% CI, 0.39-3.77) per 1 million persons for clinically amyopathic dermatomyositis. Age- and sex-adjusted prevalence for all subtypes of dermatomyositis was 21.42 (95% CI, 13.07-29.77) per 100,000 persons. Eight patients (28%) had a malignant condition during the study period; the risk of malignancy (odds ratio) for classic dermatomyositis compared with clinically amyopathic dermatomyositis was 4.61 but was not statistically significant (95% CI, 0.22-96.09) (P=.44).Dermatomyositis is a rare disease, and clinically amyopathic dermatomyositis represents an estimated 20% of all dermatomyositis cases. Larger population-based studies are needed to estimate the risk of malignancy associated with subtypes of dermatomyositis, particularly clinically amyopathic dermatomyositis."
10703035,"Holoprosencephaly is a birth defect affecting the medial structures of the brain and face. This investigation examined the epidemiology of holoprosencephaly in Hawaii between 1986 and 1997, using data obtained from a birth defects registry, and compared the results with those of other population-based studies. Twenty-five cases were identified, producing a prevalence of 1.09 per 10,000 livebirths. There were 17 (68.0%) livebirths, two (8.0%) fetal deaths and six (24.0%) elective terminations. Ten (58.8%) of the livebirths died before the age of 1 year. Seven (28.0%) had a known chromosomal abnormality, most often trisomy 13. Prevalence rates were higher for maternal age > 39 years, maternal race/ethnicity of Far East Asian or Filipino, females and residence in Maui County. The small number of cases limited the statistical significance of the study. However, this report confirms many of the findings from the previous studies and adds new findings, particularly the higher prevalence among Far East Asians and Filipinos."
23204124,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive, fibrosing interstitial pneumonia of unknown aetiology. It is a rare disease, and its incidence and prevalence are not clear. Therefore, we sought to review the published evidence on the global epidemiology of IPF. A comprehensive review of English language literature was performed by searching Medline and EMBASE for studies on IPF epidemiology published between January 1990 and August 2011. Studies providing quantitative data on IPF incidence and/or prevalence were identified and key data collected. 15 studies reporting on the incidence and/or prevalence of IPF were identified and summarised. IPF prevalence estimates in the USA varied between 14 and 27.9 cases per 100,000 population using narrow case definitions, and 42.7 and 63 per 100,000 population using broad case definitions. In Europe, IPF prevalence ranged from 1.25 to 23.4 cases per 100,000 population. The annual incidence of IPF in the USA was estimated at 6.8-8.8 per 100,000 population using narrow case definitions and 16.3-17.4 per 100,000 population using broad case definitions. In Europe, the annual incidence ranged between 0.22 and 7.4 per 100,000 population. IPF prevalence and incidence increase with age, are higher among males and appear to be on the increase in recent years. IPF is an orphan disease that affects a potentially increasing number of people in Europe and the USA. The observed variability in IPF incidence and prevalence may be explained by the differences in diagnostic criteria used, case definition, study population and study design."
18348276,"In recent years, prenatal diagnosis and elective pregnancy termination have affected the reported birth prevalence of trisomies 13 and 18. We examined the prevalence and characteristics of these conditions using 1994-2003 data from a population-based surveillance system, the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program. Including fetal deaths and elective terminations increased the number of affected pregnancies by 58.7% for trisomy 13 and 72.2% for trisomy 18. Prenatal cytogenetic testing was reported in 70.8% of trisomy 13 cases and 76.1% of trisomy 18 cases. Among those with prenatal cytogenetic tests, 60.8% of trisomy 13 and 59.7% of trisomy 18 cases were electively terminated. Compared with non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic black race was associated with a decreased frequency of prenatal cytogenetic testing for both trisomy 13 and trisomy 18 (OR 0.24, 95% CI: 0.08-0.78 and OR 0.32, 95% CI: 0.14-0.69, respectively). The reported rates of prenatal cytogenetic testing remained stable throughout the period. As expected, maternal age > or =35 years was a risk factor for both conditions. However, while 67.1% (n = 55) of the trisomy 18 case mothers were > or =35 years, only 46.9% (n = 15) of the trisomy 13 case mothers were > or =35 years. Among live-born infants, the sex ratio among trisomy 18 infants showed an increased proportion of females: 60.4% female versus 39.6% male. However, the proportion was 48.3% female and 51.7% male among fetuses that were electively terminated in the second trimester. Inclusion of pregnancies that are prenatally diagnosed is critical for accurate surveillance and population-based analyses of these conditions."
2349750,"The prevalence of known cases of acromegaly in Northern Ireland in 1984 was 6.3 per 100,000 population. The incidence of newly-diagnosed cases over the preceding 25 years was 5.5 patients per year, or 0.4 patients per 100,000 population per year. This rate would be equivalent to about 200 new cases per year in the United Kingdom. Four options have been available to most of these patients--surgical hypophysectomy (transfrontal or transsphenoidal), pituitary radiotherapy (usually external cobalt beam), drug treatment with bromocriptine, or no treatment. Choice of treatment has been mainly influenced by tumour size, with the larger pituitary adenomas having surgery initially. No single form of treatment has been successful in achieving a clinical remission or cure in more than a minority of cases. The most successful outcome has been where total pituitary ablation has been achieved. Life-table analysis for the whole group shows life expectancy which is not markedly different for that of an age-matched population from Northern Ireland. Morbidity related to long term osteoarthritis and treatment complications remain a major problem. The incidence of malignant tumours is higher than would be expected."
25213386,"Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare, chronic neutrophilic dermatosis of unknown etiology. The world wide incidence is estimated to be around 3-10 cases per million population per year. In 50-70% of cases inflammatory bowel diseases, hematological malignancies or rheumatologic disorders are associated to PG. Although the etiology is uncertain, the dysregulation of the immune system appears to be implied. Pathergy is the most important triggering factor of PG. Indeed, 20-30% of patients report the onset of PG following trivial trauma. Four main variants of PG have been described, namely classic, pustular, bullous, and vegetative forms. The classic form of PG is characterized by ulcers with a raised, undermined, inflammatory border. Intense pain is generally associated to PG. The diagnosis is mainly clinical and of exclusion. The differential diagnosis should take into account infections, vascular disorders and malignancies. The clinical course can be explosive and rapidly progressive or indolent and gradually progressive. Often patients develop only one episode and the overall prognosis is good but extremely influenced by the underlying disorders. Local therapy, mainly with topic steroids is used for mild to moderate lesions. For severe forms of PG a systemic therapy with glucocorticoids and/or other drugs such as tacrolimus, cyclosporine, etc. is needed. This paper is a systematic review of literature on PG."
8810933,"OBJECTIVE:To obtain information on the incidence of rare systemic rheumatic and connective tissue diseases in Finland. DESIGN:Population-based epidemiological study. SETTING:Five out of 21 central hospital districts in Finland (population: about 1 million adults > or = 16 years of age). SUBJECTS:Subjects entitled under the nationwide sickness insurance scheme to receive specially reimbursed medication for rare systemic rheumatic or connective tissue diseases in 1990. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE:Incidence. RESULTS:A total of 30 incident cases occurred. Nine patients had mixed connective tissue disease, four had systemic sclerosis, four had dermato/polymyositis and one patient had inclusion body myositis; the corresponding annual incidence rates were 8, 4, 4 and 1/million of the adult population. Only one patient had adult Still's disease. The overall annual incidence rate of systemic vasculitides was 9/million of the adult population. CONCLUSION:This study provides population-based figures on the incidence of rare systemic rheumatic and connective tissue diseases in Finland."
19411107,"We present the first Romanian study on the epidemiological characteristics of MDS, based on the data existing in Fundeni Clinical Institute, Hematological Department, Bucharest. The files at diagnosis of the adult patients with primary MDS admitted during the period 1982-2005, recorded in the registration forms provided by the MDS Foundation (USA), represented the primary database. This study indicates an increase in the number of new MDS cases over the period of time investigated. Also, a 10 years lower median age of the patients, a noticeable proportion of young patients and a low proportion of patients >or=81 years have been found, which situates our findings in the middle between the Eastern and Western epidemiological reported data on MDS."
1633640,"An indirect method for estimating the birth prevalence of the Crouzon syndrome is presented. The fraction of Crouzon syndrome patients in large clinical surveys of all cases of craniosynostosis is calculated and the fractional component obtained is multiplied by the known birth prevalence of craniosynostosis in general. Crouzon syndrome makes up approximately 4.8% of all cases of craniosynostosis. Using a weighted average estimate, birth prevalence was calculated to be 16.5/1,000,000. The results of the indirect method compare favorably with those obtained by the direct method. Nevertheless, because the indirect method is based on a number of assumptions that are easily violated, we cannot recommend its general use except under special circumstances."
8689476,"Sixty-two patients from three large Danish families with autosomal dominant optic atrophy were clinically examined, and retrospective follow-up was made on 30 patients. We found great inter-and intrafamiliar variation in visual acuity and visual decline. One hundred and seventy-five chromosomal markers were analyzed in 118 family members. Linkage was demonstrated between the disease gene (OPA1) and the microsatellite markers D3S1314, D3S1262, D3S1265 and D3S1601, with the highest Lod score to D3S1601 Z=11.75. All markers are located on chromosome 3q in the telomeric area, the most probable location for the OPA1 gene being D3S1601-OPA1-D3S1265. Using data from the Danish Family Register of Hereditary Eye Diseases, the minimum prevalence rate was estimated to 1:12.301, making DOA the most common hereditary optic atrophy."
16617240,"The most common fatty acid oxidation disorder, medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD), has become the focal point for the adoption of tandem mass spectrometry to detect it and related inborn errors of metabolism. This article updates a human genome epidemiology review of MCADD published in 1999. The focus of this update is on epidemiologic parameters rather than mutations associated with MCADD. Currently available information from screening studies on the frequency of detection of MCADD in newborns, as well as the frequency of homozygotes for the common mutation in the ACADM gene, is summarized. In the United States, the average incidence of the disorder is from 1 in 15,000 to 1 in 20,000 births, with individual states reporting frequencies from 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 30,000 births. In addition, a systematic review was undertaken of the published literature on the frequency of mortality and developmental disabilities among children with MCADD, both in screened and unscreened cohorts. It seems that in the absence of newborn screening for MCADD, premature death or serious disability occurs in 20% to 25% of children with the disorder. Systematic collection and analysis of follow-up data are still needed to ascertain the frequencies of outcomes in screened cohorts."
15821570,"PURPOSE: Although bladder exstrophy is much discussed in the urology literature, there are few population based epidemiological data available for this rare condition. The purpose of this study was to use a large nationwide database to collect contemporary data on the incidence and demographics of bladder exstrophy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Nationwide Inpatient Sample is a 20% sample of nonfederal United States hospitals containing data on 5 million to 7 million inpatient stays per year. The sample was limited to newborns, and International Classification of Disease-9 codes were used to identify cases of bladder exstrophy. We then determined nationally weighted incidence through time, and performed multivariate analyses to identify factors associated with exstrophy. RESULTS: We identified 205 patients with exstrophy among 9,452,110 newborns. The overall weighted incidence of exstrophy was 2.15 per 100,000 live births. The male-to-female ratio was almost even (OR 0.989, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.12). White infants were significantly more likely to present with exstrophy than nonwhites (incidence 2.63 vs 1.54 per 100,000, p <0.0001). Exstrophy incidence also varied by geographic region, socioeconomic status (SES) and insurance status. On multivariate analysis the racial variation in exstrophy incidence persisted even after adjustment for geographic region, SES and insurance status. Conditions such as spina bifida, cleft palate, preterm birth and gastrointestinal anomalies were more common in newborns with exstrophy. CONCLUSIONS: Bladder exstrophy is rare, occurs in equal numbers of live male and female newborns, and is associated with certain co-morbid conditions. Incidence appears to be stable through time. Nonwhite race, uninsured status, high or low SES and Western geographic region are associated with lower exstrophy incidence."
1155460,"A genetic analysis is presented of data from 22 Brazilian sibships with cases of acheiropodia (the handless and footless families of Brazil). Segregation  analysis performed using a 16K CDC 3100 computer showed a segregation frequency of .245 +/- .040, which is close to the expected value of .25. No sporadic cases were detected. The ascertainment of the probands was through multiple incomplete selection (pi = .55 +/- .07). The data are consistent with the hypothesis of an extremely rare autosomal recessive gene as the etiological factor in acheiropodia. Prevalence is estimated as 29 +/- 4, which is the same as the number of high risk cases; gene frequency equals .0009 +/- .0005, and the incidence at birth is 4 times 10(-6) by the indirect method or 7 times 10(-6) by the direct method. The frequency of heterozygotes at birth is assumed to be 0.18% (450 times the frequency of affected). Population size is approximately 10 million, and the number of founders on a unique-mutation hypothesis is estimated as about 500. All these estimates are first approximations and must be accepted with caution."
25305203,"The epidemiology of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is not well known. The purpose of this study was to assess ITP incidence at a nationwide level (France) with recent data (mid-2009 to mid-2011; 129 248 543 person-years). The data source is the French health insurance database. We selected cases with diagnosis codes for in-hospital stays and long-term disease attributions, thus restricting our search to ITPs necessitating health care. We studied incidence by age, gender, calendar month, regions, and proportion of secondary ITPs, of ITPs becoming persistent or chronic, and of severe bleeding at disease onset. We identified 3771 incident ITP patients. Incidence was 2.9/100,000 person-years, with peaks among children and in those >60 years of age. ITP was more frequent among males in these subgroups. The incidence was lower in overseas Caribbean French departments, suggesting a lower incidence among Afro-American people. There was a north-south gradient in mainland France and seasonal variations (peak in winter and nadir in summer). Persistence or chronicity occurred in 36% of children compared with 67% of adults. Among adults, 18% of ITPs were secondary. Malignancy was the main cause (10.9%). Myelodysplastic syndromes were not rare (2.3%). Severe gastrointestinal or central nervous system bleeding at ITP onset was rare (<1%)."
23114748,"Retrospective estimates of the prevalence of porphyrias have been reported but there has been no large scale prospective study of their incidence. The European Porphyria Network collected information prospectively over a 3 year period about the number of newly diagnosed symptomatic patients with an inherited porphyria (335 patients from 11 countries). Prevalence was calculated from the incidence and mean disease duration. The incidence of hepato-cellular carcinoma (HCC) in acute hepatic porphyria and the prevalence of patients with recurrent acute attacks of porphyria were also investigated. The incidence of symptomatic acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) was similar in all countries (0.13 per million per year; 95 % CI: 0.10 - 0.14) except Sweden (0.51; 95 % CI: 0.28-0.86). The incidence ratio for symptomatic AIP: variegate porphyria: hereditary coproporphyria was 1.00:0.62: 0.15. The prevalence of AIP (5.4 per million; 95 % CI: 4.5-6.3) was about half that previously reported. The prevalence of erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) was less uniform between countries and, in some countries, exceeded previous estimates. Fourteen new cases of HCC (11 from Sweden) were reported in patients with acute porphyria. Sixty seven patients (3 VP; 64 AIP: 53 females, 11 males) with recurrent attacks of acute porphyria were identified. The estimated percentage of patients with AIP that will develop recurrent acute attacks was 3-5 %. In conclusion, the prevalence of symptomatic acute porphyria may be decreasing, possibly due to improved management, whereas the prevalence of EPP may be increasing due to improved diagnosis and its greater recognition as a cause of photosensitivity."
10482961,"Glycogen storage disease type II (GSD H) is an autosomal recessive myopathy. Early and late-onset phenotypes are distinguished - infantile, juvenile and adult. Three mutations in the acid alpha-glucosidase gene are common in the Dutch patient population: IVS1(-13T-->G), 525delT and delexon18. 63% of Dutch GSD II patients carry one or two of these mutations, and the genotype-phenotype correlation is known. To determine the frequency of GSD II, we have screened an unselected sample of neonates for the occurrence of these three mutations. Based on the calculated carrier frequencies, the predicted frequency of the disease is 1 in 40000 divided by 1 in 138 000 for infantile GSD II and 1 in 57 000 for adult GSD II. This is about two to four times higher than previously suggested, which is a reason to become more familiar with the presentation of GSD II in its different clinical forms and to adjust the risk assessment for genetic counselling."
15832312,"Medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD) is the most frequent inherited defect of fatty acid oxidation, with a significant morbidity and mortality in undiagnosed patients. Adverse outcomes can effectively be prevented by avoiding metabolic stress and following simple dietary measures. Therefore, prospective newborn screening (NBS) is being proposed for this condition. However, technical validation of MCADD population screening and assessment of its overall benefit require broadening of the as-yet-scarce knowledge of the MCADD genetic heterogeneity unraveled by NBS and its phenotypic consequences. Here, we describe the entire spectrum of sequence variations occurring in newborns with MCADD in the population of Bavaria, Germany, in relation to the biochemical phenotype. Among 524,287 newborns, we identified 62 cases of MCADD, indicating a birth incidence of 1 in 8,456. In all of the 57 newborns available for analysis, two alterations within the MCADD gene (ACADM) were identified. The most prevalent alteration c.985A>G (Lys329Glu) occurred in 27 (47%) newborns in the homozygous and in 18 (32%) in the heterozygous state (63% of defective alleles). The mild folding variant c.199T>C (Tyr67His) was identified in nine individuals, six of them being compound heterozygous with c.985A>G (Lys329Glu). Neither of the prevalent alterations were found in the remaining nine newborns. A total of 18 sequence variations were identified; 13 of them were novel: eight missense mutations, one nonsense mutation, two splice variants, and two small deletions. The remaining five were previously reported in MCADD patients. The ACADM heterogeneity uncovered was larger as anticipated from previous c.985A>G (Lys329Glu) carrier screening data. In addition, we show that MCADD appears to occur as frequently in Turkish newborns as in the native German population. Our data validate that biochemical NBS for MCADD is a highly specific procedure for disease detection, with the identification of a significant share of milder biochemical phenotypes, such as c.199T>C (Tyr67His). These show statistically lower acylcarnitine markers, allowing us to distinguish subgroups within the spectrum of ACADM sequence variations that correlate to biochemical MCADD disease expression. Our data might provide technical and medical guidance for decision making in the worldwide efforts to introduce MCADD population screening."
24008954,"Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) are abnormal vascular structures that most often connect a pulmonary artery to a pulmonary vein, bypassing the normal pulmonary capillary bed and resulting in an intrapulmonary right-to-left shunt. As a consequence, patients with PAVM can have hypoxemia and paradoxical embolization complications, including stroke and brain abscess. PAVMs may be single or multiple, unilateral or bilateral, and simple or complex. Most PAVMs are hereditary and occur in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, an autosomal dominant vascular disorder, and screening for PAVM is indicated in this subgroup. PAVMs may also be idiopathic, occur as a result of trauma and infection, or be secondary to hepatopulmonary syndrome and bidirectional cavopulmonary shunting. Diagnostic testing involves identifying an intrapulmonary shunt, with the most sensitive test being transthoracic contrast echocardiography. Chest CT scan is useful in characterizing PAVM in patients with positive intrapulmonary shunting. Transcatheter embolotherapy is the treatment of choice for PAVM. Lifelong follow-up is important because recanalization and collateralization may occur after embolization therapy. Surgical resection is rarely necessary and reserved for patients who are not candidates for embolization. Antibiotic prophylaxis for procedures with a risk of bacteremia (eg, dental procedures) is recommended in all patients with PAVM because of the risk of cerebral abscess."
6693042,"We describe a long term study of 76 patients with dermatitis herpetiformis. Unlike patients with coeliac disease, where the peak incidence was during the first and fourth decades, no dermatitis herpetiformis patients presented in the first decade; also, there was a male preponderance in dermatitis herpetiformis which contrasts with the excess of females in coeliac disease. The apparent prevalence of dermatitis herpetiformis was 11 per 100 000 in our population; approximately one fifth of that of coeliac disease. Jejunal villous atrophy was present in 78% of our dermatitis herpetiformis patients, and a single jejunal biopsy was as effective at detecting this as the multiple biopsy technique. A majority of patients were able to stop, or radically reduce their dapsone or sulphapyridine treatment after the institution of a gluten free diet. Spontaneous remission of the skin lesion occurred in only two patients not receiving a gluten free diet. Gastric parietal or thyroid antibodies were detected in 38% of patients, and three cases of thyroid disease and two cases of pernicious anaemia were detected. Lymphoma developed in two patients, one being intestinal in origin. We conclude that a gluten free diet is of therapeutic benefit in dermatitis herpetiformis and that spontaneous remission is uncommon in those not on a diet. Despite patchiness of the enteropathy, a single jejunal biopsy is quite adequate to diagnose the presence of upper intestinal villous atrophy."
19494549,"BACKGROUND: To investigate the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics (age, sex, tumor location, socioeconomic status) and potential predisposing factors (alcohol, tobacco, mobile phone use, severe head trauma) of cerebral gliomas in a defined area of Northwest Greece. METHODS: The prospective study was conducted in patients with gliomas referred to all 7 hospitals of a study area with a population of 488,435 inhabitants, from June 1, 2005, to May 31, 2007. Incidence rates (IR) were calculated as new cases diagnosed among residents of the study area during the study period per 100,000 inhabitants. A case-control study was carried out in order to study the possible association of the risk of glioma with smoking, alcohol, use of mobile phone, and severe cranial trauma. RESULTS: A total of 56 glioma incident cases were identified with IRs of glioma and glioblastoma (GBM) at 5.73/10(5)/year and 3.69/10(5)/year, respectively. A male to female ratio of 1.25 was obtained in the GBM group. IRs of glioma and GBM for both males and females were higher in the age group 60-79. The most frequent anatomic location was the frontal lobe. 46.5% of the patients originated from the low, 25% from the middle and 28.5% from the high socioeconomic class. There was no significant association between glioma and alcohol consumption, smoking and mobile phone use. A trend for a positive association between the risk of glioma and a history of severe cranial trauma was observed, but this association was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: The estimated IR of glioma and GBM in this study was higher compared with data from other studies carried out on European, Asian and US populations. Further studies may be needed to assess the possible association of genetic, environmental and lifestyle factors with the high occurrence of gliomas observed in this study."
16673273,"The annual incidence of polycythemia vera (PV) and essential thrombocythemia (ET) is approximately 2 and 1.5 per 100,000 inhabitants, respectively, if based on large population surveys and adjusted to a standard population. Survival for ET patients does not differ from that of the general population. However, it appears that PV patients have a significantly higher mortality, at least for patients diagnosed before 1990."
16892327,"Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by multiple contractures with an estimated frequency of 1 in 3,000 births. With improving diagnostic methods, increasing numbers of fetuses with arthrogryposis are found. The pathogenetic mechanisms are relatively well known but the epidemiology and genetics of the prenatally lethal forms of arthrogryposis are less well known. In this study we collected all cases of a multiple contractures diagnosed in Finland during 1987-2002 including live born infants, stillbirths, and terminated pregnancies. Ninety-two cases of 214 suffered intrauterine demise (68 selective pregnancy terminations and 24 stillbirths) and 58 died in infancy. In 141 out of these cases the diagnosis could be included within lethal arthrogryposes, with a prevalence of 1 in 6,985 (1.43/10,000) births. Of these, 59 had spinal cord pathology at autopsy and thus were of neurogenic origin. Thirty-nine cases had lethal congenital contracture syndrome (LCCS) clinically characterized by total immobility of the fetus at all ultrasound examinations (12 weeks or later), multiple joint contractures in both upper and lower limbs, hydrops, and fetal death before the 32nd week of pregnancy. LCCS is noted as a unique Finnish disorder with a prevalence of 1 in 25,250 (0.40/10,000) births and is a major cause of lethal arthrogryposis in Finland."
18986562,"OBJECTIVES:To assess epidemiologic characteristics of penile cancer in Brazil. MATERIALS AND METHODS:From May 2006 to June 2007, a questionnaire was distributed to all Brazilian urologists. Their patients' clinical and epidemiological data was analyzed (age, race, place of residence, history of sexually transmitted diseases, tobacco smoking, performance of circumcision, type of hospital service), as well as the time between the appearance of the symptoms and the diagnosis, the pathological characteristics of the tumor (histological type, degree, localization and size of lesion, stage of disease), the type of treatment performed and the present state of the patient. RESULTS:283 new cases of penile cancer in Brazil were recorded. The majority of these cases occurred in the north and northeast (53.02%) and southeast (45.54%) regions. The majority of patients (224, or 78.96%) were more than 46 years of age while only 21 patients (7.41%) were less than 35 years of age. Of the 283 patients presenting penile cancer, 171 (60.42%) had phimosis with the consequent impossibility to expose the glans. A prior medical history positive for HPV infection was reported in 18 of the 283 cases (6.36%). In 101 patients (35.68%) tobacco smoking was reported. The vast majority of the cases (n = 207; 73.14%) presented with tumors localized in the glans and prepuce. In 48 cases (16.96%) the tumor affected the glans, the prepuce and the corpus penis; in 28 cases (9.89%) the tumor affected the entire penis. The majority of the patients (n = 123; 75.26%) presented with T1 or T2; only 9 patients (3.18%) presented with T4 disease. CONCLUSION:Penile cancer is a very frequent pathology in Brazil, predominantly affecting low income, white, uncircumcised patients, living in the north and northeast regions of the country."
11889231,"BACKGROUND:International prevalence estimates of autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCA) vary from 0.3 to 2.0 per 100,000. The prevalence of ADCA in the Netherlands is unknown. Fifteen genetic loci have been identified (SCA-1-8, SCA-10-14, SCA-16, and SCA-17) and nine of the corresponding genes have been cloned. In SCA-1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, SCA-12 and SCA-17 the mutation has been shown to be an expanded CAG repeat. Previously, the length of the CAG repeat was found to account for 50 to 80% of variance in age at onset. Because of heterogeneity in encoded proteins, different pathophysiologic mechanisms leading to neurodegeneration could be involved. The relationship between CAG repeat length and age at onset would then differ accordingly. METHOD:Based on the results of SCA mutation analysis in the three DNA diagnostic laboratories that serve the entire Dutch population, the authors surveyed the number of families and affected individuals per SCA gene, as well as individual repeat length and age at onset. Regression analysis was applied to study the relationship between CAG repeat length and age at onset per SCA gene. The slopes of the different regression curves were compared. RESULTS:On November 1, 2000, mutations were found in 145 ADCA families and 391 affected individuals were identified. The authors extrapolated a minimal prevalence of 3.0 per 100,000 (range 2.8 to 3.8/100,000). SCA3 was the most frequent mutation. CAG repeat length contributed to 52 to 76% of age at onset variance. Regression curve slopes for SCA-1, SCA2, SCA3, and SCA7 did not differ significantly. CONCLUSIONS:The estimated minimal prevalence of ADCA in the Netherlands is 3.0 per 100,000 inhabitants. Except for SCA6, the relationship between age at onset and CAG repeat expansion does not differ significantly between SCA-1, SCA2, SCA3, and SCA7 patient groups in our population, indicating that these SCA subtypes share similar mechanisms of polyglutamine-induced neurotoxicity, despite heterogeneity in gene products."
12389865,"Hearing loss, bone fragility, and blue sclerae are the principal clinical features in osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), a genetic disorder of connective tissue. In a nationwide search, an audiometric evaluation of 133 adult patients was performed. According to the criteria introduced by Sillence, type I was the most common form of OI. Of the patients with normal hearing on audiometry, 17.1% reported subjective hearing loss, and 19.1% of the patients with impaired hearing did not recognize it. On audiometry, 57.9% of the patients had hearing loss, which was progressive, often of mixed type, and mostly bilateral, and began in the second to fourth decades of life. The frequency or severity of the hearing loss was not correlated with any other clinical features of OI. Hearing loss is common, affecting patients with all types of OI. Subjective misjudgment of hearing ability supports the need for repeated audiometry in all OI patients. A baseline study at the age of OI years followed by audiograms every third year thereafter is recommended."
25382730,"A nationwide survey was conducted to assess the number of patients, clinical aspects, treatment, and prognosis of adult Still's disease (ASD) in Japan.A primary questionnaire was sent to randomly selected medical institutions in order to estimate the number of patients. We sent a secondary questionnaire to the same institutions to characterize the clinical manifestations and treatment of ASD.The estimated prevalence of ASD was 3.9 per 100,000. Analysis of 169 patients showed a mean age at onset of 46 years. The main clinical symptoms were fever, arthritis, and typical rash in agreement with previous surveys. Oral glucocorticoids were used to treat 96% of the patients, while methotrexate was used in 41% and biological agents were used in 16%. Lymphadenopathy and macrophage activation syndrome were significantly associated with increased risk of relapse (P < 0.05, each). Patients who achieved remission after tocilizumab therapy had significantly longer disease duration (6.2 years) than patients who did not (1.9 years) (p < 0.05).The 2010-2011 nationwide survey of ASD identified important changes in treatment and improvement of prognosis compared with previous surveys."
15194588,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the annual incidence of primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) in Slovenia. METHODS: All patients admitted to our department of rheumatology or referred to our outpatient clinic between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2002 owing to sicca symptoms or because of a suspicion of SS were examined. Our rheumatological department is the only tertiary referral centre for the Ljubljana region, which has a population of 599 895 Caucasian people. All patients were evaluated by the validated European criteria for SS. The exact 95% confidence interval (CI) based on binomial distribution was created for the incidence estimate. RESULTS: 248 patients were examined; 71 of them (28.6%; 65 women, 6 men) were diagnosed as having pSS. Their mean (SD) age was 51.3 (14.5) years (range 19-78). The average annual incidence for pSS in our study population was calculated as 3.9 cases per 100 000 inhabitants (95% CI 1.1 to 10.2). CONCLUSION: The estimated annual incidence of pSS in Slovenia is 3.9/100 000."
11484513,"We report the results of a prospective registration of the prevalence of interstitial lung diseases by 20 centres of respiratory medicine in Flanders from January 1992 till July 1996. The 20 centres registered a total of 362 cases. Sarcoidosis (31% with inclusion of stage I, or 22% without stage I), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (20%), hypersensitivity pneumonitis (13%) and unclassified forms of interstitial lung diseases (9%) were the most often diagnosed diseases. The mean age of the patients was 52 +/- 17 (SD) years, but ranged from 32 +/- 10 years in histiocytosis X to 70 +/- 13 years in drug induced interstitial lung diseases. The male to female ratio was 1.3 but ranged from 2.3 in interstitial lung diseases due to inhalation of inorganic materials to 0.8 in interstitial lung diseases due to connective tissue disease. The diagnosis was considered certain in 60%, probable in 30% and possible in 10%. In 50% of the cases the diagnosis was proven by biopsy and the most often used biopsy technique was transbronchiolo-alveolar biopsy (40% of biopsies) followed by open lung biopsy (32%). At diagnosis vital capacity was 82 +/- 22% pred. (ranging from 92 +/- 19% in sarcoidosis to 71 +/- 24% in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis) and CO-diffusing capacity was 77 +/- 19% pred. (ranging from 77 +/- 19% in sarcoidosis to 41 +/- 13% in drug induced pneumonitis). The regional frequency of interstitial lung diseases in Flanders varied widely and was not proportional to the regional distribution of the 20 contributing centres. In conclusion this registration provides interesting information on the occurrence and presentation of the different forms of interstitial lung diseases, although it may still underestimate the real prevalence and incidence of interstitial lung diseases."
14678803,"Mechanical ventilation of patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy continues to be a subject of study. The purpose was to estimate prevalence, incidence, mortality and use of mechanical ventilation in the total Duchenne muscular dystrophy population in Denmark between 1977 and 2001 and further, to reconstruct the introduction of mechanical ventilation to assess the role of the patient organization. Study objects were collected from five sources and verifiable cases identified. Negotiations between health authorities and the patient organization constituted main empirical data for the reconstruction. While overall incidence remained stable at 2.0 per 10(5), prevalence rose from 3.1 to 5.5 per 10(5), mortality fell from 4.7 to 2.6 per 100 years at risk and prevalence of Duchenne muscular dystrophy ventilator users rose from 0.9 to 43.4 per 100. We conclude that survival of Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients has increased and ventilator use is probably a main reason. The patient organization exercised a key role but acted upon preconditions created by other players."
25430571,"Aplasia cutis congenita (ACC) is a rare congenital defect of the skin. In this study we present the diagnosis and management of the condition. In 1997-2009 a total of 65 ACC cases were registered in the Danish National Patient Registry (1:13.000 births). The mortality among these cases was 1.6% (one case) though the death was not attributable to ACC, which is far lower than described in international studies."
17535377,"BACKGROUND: The incidence of sarcoidosis in Australia is unknown. The clinical features, diagnostic strategy and treatment of sarcoidosis in Australia have been poorly documented. METHODS: We analysed the medical records of 122 patients with sarcoidosis presenting to a respiratory service, between 1995 and 2005, which serves a regional southeastern Australian population of approximately 200,000. RESULTS: The incidence of sarcoidosis from 2000 to 2005 remained static and ranged from 4.4 to 6.3 patients per 100,000 population. The data showed that 55% were women and 28% were current smokers. Systems involved included lung parenchyma (66%), thoracic adenopathy (58%), skin (22%), ocular (18%), joint (11%), gastrointestinal tract (5%), central nervous system (3%) and hypercalcaemia (3%). Fifty-one per cent of patients had an increased serum angiotensin-converting enzyme level. The diagnosis was secured based on histological confirmation in 69%. Forty-three per cent of the patients were treated with oral corticosteroids and 10% with inhaled steroids. CONCLUSION: Sarcoidosis in Australia is a multi-system disease of unknown aetiology. This is the first reported incidence of sarcoidosis in Australia. The incidence is similar to another US-based epidemiological study of a predominately white population. The development of a larger multicentre database would assist in the identification, clinical description and treatment of sarcoidosis."
14679397,"The identification of all people with a diagnosis of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) confirmed by DNA methylation analysis living in Flanders was attempted through contact with the four genetic centres and the PWS Association. The birth incidence for the period 1993-2001 was 1:26 676, the minimum prevalence at 31 December 2001 was 1:76 574. A decreasing number of cases with age was found, which can be explained by a number of missing cases in the older population, a higher neonatal mortality in the past and an increasing mortality with age. Childhood death is usually sudden and associated with respiratory infection and high temperature, while the cause of death in adults is considered to be circulatory or respiratory in origin."
22624626,"Severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) is characterized by low blood neutrophil counts, early bacterial infections, and risk of leukaemia development. As yet, no population-based incidence estimates of SCN have been reported. Children less than 16 years of age with SCN were sought in Sweden during the 20-year period 1987-2006 by a questionnaire to all Swedish Departments of Paediatrics and by reviewing the Swedish Health and Welfare Statistical Databases. Thirty-two patients were diagnosed with congenital neutropenia during this period. All received treatment with recombinant granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). Twenty-one patients were diagnosed as SCN or probable SCN, corresponding to 1·0 per 100,000 live births. Nine (43%) had ELANE mutations, four (19%) HAX1 mutations and eight (38%) were children with disease of unknown genetic aetiology. Four out of 21 patients (19%) developed myelodysplastic syndrome/leukaemia and three (14%) died, all with leukaemia. The cumulative incidence of myelodysplastic syndrome/leukaemia was 31%. The observed incidence of SCN in this population-based study was higher than previously estimated, possibly because genetic testing now can identify SCN cases previously thought to be idiopathic or benign neutropenia. The risk of developing myelodysplastic syndrome/leukaemia is considerable. ELANE mutations are the most commonly identified genetic defects."
21109475,"BACKGROUND: In France, the notification of Legionnaires' disease (LD) has been mandatory since 1987. Following a study showing an important under-reporting of the disease, the surveillance system was strengthened in 1997: the urinary antigen detection test was introduced as a new diagnostic tool and guidelines for prevention and control of the disease were implemented. After these measures, the incidence of LD increased gradually, reaching 2.5 per 100,000 in 2005, and then slightly decreased (2.0 per 100,000 in 2008). METHODS: Data from the mandatory notification system and from the national reference centre for Legionella were analysed. Analysis covered the 1998-2008 period. RESULTS: During the period 1998-2008 a total of 11147 cases of LD were reported in France through the mandatory system. The majority of cases were diagnosed by urinary antigen test. The median age of cases was 61 years, the male to female ratio was 2.9, and the case fatality rate was 13%. Exposure during travel was documented for 17% of cases. A hospital-acquired infection was suspected for 9% of cases, and this percentage decreased from 21% in 1998 to 7% in 2008. Over this period, 14 community outbreaks were identified involving 380 cases, and cooling towers were the most probable source of infection for 13. No outbreak was reported in 2008. Registration at the regional level of all cooling towers became mandatory at the end of 2004, and the 1997 prevention and control guidelines were updated in 2005. In recent years, several regulations have also been implemented in the hospital setting and care homes for the elderly. CONCLUSION: All these measures have contributed to strengthen the French surveillance system and improve our ability to better prevent, detect, and control LD."
19245432,"The epidemiology of immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is not well-characterised in the general population. This study described the incidence and survival of ITP using the UK population-based General Practice Research Database (GPRD). ITP patients first diagnosed in 1990-2005 were identified in the GPRD. Overall incidence rates (per 100,000 person-years) and rates by age, sex, and calendar periods were calculated. Survival analysis was conducted using the Kaplan-Meier and proportional hazard methods. A total of 1145 incident ITP patients were identified. The crude incidence was 3.9 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.7-4.1). Overall average incidence was statistically significantly higher in women (4.4, 95% CI: 4.1-4.7) compared to men (3.4; 95% CI: 3.1-3.7). Among men, incidence was bimodal with peaks among ages under 18 and between 75-84 years. The hazard ratio for death among ITP patients was 1.6 (95% CI: 1.3-1.9) compared to age- and sex-matched comparisons. During follow-up 139 cases died, of whom 75 had a computerised plausible cause of death. Death was related to bleeding in 13% and infection in 19% of these 75. In conclusion, ITP incidence varies with age and is higher in women than men. This potentially serious medical condition is associated with increased mortality in the UK."
22941398,"Tungiasis (sand flea disease) is caused by the penetration of females of Tunga penetrans into the skin of the feet. Within 2 weeks of penetration the burrowed flea increases its volume by a factor of 2,000. This is paralleled by intense inflammation of the surrounding tissue. Acute and chronic inflammation leads to the development of painful and debilitating clinical pathology. This results in impaired physical fitness and mobility. The social implications of tungiasis-associated morbidity are multifold. Children with tungiasis are teased and ridiculed, adults feel ashamed and stigmatized. There is anecdotal evidence that tungiasis negatively affects educational achievements. Impaired mobility and physical fitness will have a negative impact on household economics. Sand flea disease is common in resource-poor communities in South America and in sub-Saharan Africa with prevalence in the general population of up to 60%. In East Africa, it has re-emerged in epidemic dimensions in recent years. Hitherto, no effective drug treatment has been at hand. Traditional treatment, i.e., the manipulation of burrowed sand fleas with blunt and inappropriate instruments may facilitate the transmission of blood-derived pathogens. Prevention is feasible through regular application of a repellent based on coconut oil. Owing to its strong association with poverty, sand flea disease would be an excellent starting point for a community-based fight against rural poverty."
1290156,"From 1983 through 1987, in a California population of 718,208 births, 237 infants were born with a congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), a birth prevalence of 3.30 per 10,000 total births (live births and stillbirths). We proposed that the various types of this defect, characterized by their different pathogeneses, would be reflected in differences in their descriptive epidemiologies. We evaluated various demographic, maternal, and infant characteristics for three major types of defects, the Morgagni hernia, the pars sternalis hernia, and the posterolateral hernia, categorizing the latter type into isolated defect (N = 129), multiple congenital anomalies including nonchromosomal syndromes (N = 86), trisomies (N = 10), and chromosomal anomalies other than trisomies (N = 2). For the posterolateral hernia, we present the distribution of associated anomalies (43%) and specifically of midline defects (19%). Although the number of cases for the Morgagni hernia (N = 5) and the pars sternalis hernia (N = 5) were small, comparisons with the posterolateral hernia suggested lower sex ratios, of borderline significance for the pars sternalis hernia (P < 0.09), and higher mean maternal ages for both groups. Within the posterolateral type, we found a significantly higher male to female ratio (M/F = 1.58) only for the isolated subgroup compared to the population (P < 0.03), and a borderline significant rural/urban difference in prevalences (2.12 vs. 1.45 per 10,000) (P < 0.06). Additionally, the distribution of monthly prevalence rates adjusted for gestational age suggested opposite seasonal trends between the isolated and the other posterolateral hernias; within this latter subgroup the difference between the highest monthly rate (1.68) and the lowest (0.96) was of borderline significance (P < 0.09). Our results suggest the need to consider the respective types and subgroups of CDH separately in epidemiologic studies."
17051527,"BACKGROUND: In the United States, birth defects affect approximately 3% of all births, are a leading cause of infant mortality, and contribute substantially to childhood morbidity. METHODS: Population-based data from the National Birth Defects Prevention Network were combined to estimate the prevalence of 21 selected defects for 1999-2001, stratified by surveillance system type. National prevalence was estimated for each defect by pooling data from 11 states with active case-finding, and adjusting for the racial/ethnic distribution of US live births. We also assessed racial/ethnic variation of the selected birth defects. RESULTS: National birth defect prevalence estimates ranged from 0.82 per 10,000 live births for truncus arteriosus to 13.65 per 10,000 live births for Down syndrome. Compared with infants of non-Hispanic (NH) white mothers, infants of NH black mothers had a significantly higher birth prevalence of tetralogy of Fallot, lower limb reduction defects, and trisomy 18, and a significantly lower birth prevalence of cleft palate, cleft lip with or without cleft palate, esophageal atresia/tracheoesophageal fistula, gastroschisis, and Down syndrome. Infants of Hispanic mothers, compared with infants of NH white mothers, had a significantly higher birth prevalence of anencephalus, spina bifida, encephalocele, gastroschisis, and Down syndrome, and a significantly lower birth prevalence of tetralogy of Fallot, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, cleft palate without cleft lip, and esophageal atresia/tracheoesophageal fistula. CONCLUSIONS: This study can be used to evaluate individual state surveillance data, and to help plan for public health care and educational needs. It also provides valuable data on racial/ethnic patterns of selected major birth defects."
21635785,"Machado-Joseph Disease (MJD), also known as spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3), represents the most common form of SCA worldwide. MJD is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder of late onset, involving predominantly the cerebellar, pyramidal, extrapyramidal, motor neuron and oculomotor systems; although sharing features with other SCAs, the identification of minor, but more specific signs, facilitates its differential diagnosis. MJD presents strong phenotypic heterogeneity, which has justified the classification of patients into three main clinical types. Main pathological lesions are observed in the spinocerebellar system, as well as in the cerebellar dentate nucleus. MJD's causative mutation consists in an expansion of an unstable CAG tract in exon 10 of the ATXN3 gene, located at 14q32.1. Haplotype-based studies have suggested that two main founder mutations may explain the present global distribution of the disease; the ancestral haplotype is of Asian origin, and has an estimated age of around 5,800 years, while the second mutational event has occurred about 1,400 years ago. The ATXN3 gene encodes for ataxin-3, which is ubiquitously expressed in neuronal and non-neuronal tissues, and, among other functions, is thought to participate in cellular protein quality control pathways. Mutated ATXN3 alleles consensually present about 61 to 87 CAG repeats, resulting in an expanded polyglutamine tract in ataxin-3. This altered protein gains a neurotoxic function, through yet unclear mechanisms. Clinical variability of MJD is only partially explained by the size of the CAG tract, which leaves a residual variance that should be explained by still unknown additional factors. Several genetic tests are available for MJD, and Genetic Counseling Programs have been created to better assist the affected families, namely on what concerns the possibility of pre-symptomatic testing. The main goal of this review was to bring together updated knowledge on MJD, covering several aspects from its initial descriptions and clinical presentation, through the discovery of the causative mutation, its origin and dispersion, as well as molecular genetics aspects considered essential for a better understanding of its neuropathology. Issues related with molecular testing and Genetic Counseling, as well as recent progresses and perspectives on genetic therapy, are also addressed."
12788994,"BACKGROUND: The recent development of electrospray tandem mass spectrometry makes it possible to screen newborns for many rare inborn errors of metabolism, but the efficacy and outcomes of screening remain unknown. We examined the effect of the screening of newborns by tandem mass spectrometry on the rates of diagnosis of 31 disorders. METHODS: We compared the rates of detection of 31 inborn errors affecting the metabolism of the urea cycle, amino acids, and organic acids and fatty-acid oxidation among 362,000 newborns screened by tandem mass spectrometry over a four-year period (April 1998 through March 2002) with the rates in six preceding four-year birth cohorts in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory, Australia, where screening, diagnostic, and clinical services were centralized. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of disorders during the periods when clinical diagnosis was used did not vary between 1982 and 1998. In the cohort screened with tandem mass spectrometry, the prevalence of inborn errors, excluding phenylketonuria, was 15.7 per 100,000 births (95 percent confidence interval, 11.9 to 20.4), as compared with adjusted rates of 8.6 to 9.5 per 100,000 births in the four preceding four-year cohorts. Of the 57 cases diagnosed after the introduction of newborn screening, 15 were diagnosed clinically; 7 of the 15 newborns had a normal result on screening. The rate of detection was increased specifically for medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency (P<0.001) and other disorders of fatty-acid oxidation (P=0.007), as compared with the 16-year period before the implementation of neonatal screening for these disorders. CONCLUSIONS: More cases of inborn errors of metabolism are diagnosed by screening with tandem mass spectrometry than are diagnosed clinically. It is not yet clear which patients with disorders diagnosed by such screening would have become symptomatic if screening had not been performed."
9705586,"For the period 1976 through 1996, we carried out an incidence and prevalence study of myasthenia gravis in the County of the Coast and Gorski kotar, Croatia. This was the first epidemiological study of myasthenia gravis in Croatia. A total of 43 incident cases were identified. Overall the average crude annual incidence rate was 6.52 per 1,000,000 person-years; 5.59 per 1,000,000 person-years for men and 7.41 per 1,000,000 person-years for women. The incidence rate was 6.30 (95% confidence intervals 4.56-8.51), age-adjusted to the European population and 5.17 (95% confidence intervals 3.74-6.98), age-adjusted to the world population. On 31 December 1996, there were 32 prevalent cases. The crude prevalence was 99 per 1,000,000 population (95% confidence intervals 67.7-139.6). The prevalence adjusted to the European and world populations was 101.9 (95% confidence intervals 69.7-143.7) and 75.9 (95% confidence intervals 51.9-107) per 1,000,000 population, respectively. Our incidence findings are similar to those reported in North-East Italy but lower than those in the United States. Our prevalence findings were generally higher than those in Northern European Countries but lower than those in the United States. Standardization of rates to the European or world population could facilitate comparison between different populations."
9918480,"CONTEXT:Lysosomal storage disorders represent a group of at least 41 genetically distinct, biochemically related, inherited diseases. Individually, these disorders are considered rare, although high prevalence values have been reported in some populations. These disorders are devastating for individuals and their families and result in considerable use of resources from health care systems; however, the magnitude of the problem is not well defined. To date, no comprehensive study has been performed on the prevalence of these disorders as a group. OBJECTIVE:To determine the prevalence of lysosomal storage disorders individually and as a group in the Australian population. DESIGN:Retrospective case studies. SETTING:Australia, from January 1, 1980, through December 31, 1996. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE:Enzymatic diagnosis of a lysosomal storage disorder. RESULTS:Twenty-seven different lysosomal storage disorders were diagnosed in 545 individuals. The prevalence ranged from 1 per 57000 live births for Gaucher disease to 1 per 4.2 million live births for sialidosis. Eighteen of 27 disorders had more than 10 diagnosed cases. As a group of disorders, the combined prevalence was 1 per 7700 live births. There was no significant increase in the rate of either clinical diagnoses or prenatal diagnoses of lysosomal storage disorders during the study period. CONCLUSIONS:Individually, lysosomal storage disorders are rare genetic diseases. However, as a group, they are relatively common and represent an important health problem in Australia."
25108559,"Genetic factors are important in all forms of dementia, especially in early onset dementia. The frequency of major gene defects in dementia has not been investigated in the Netherlands. Furthermore, whether the recently in a FTD family identified PRKAR1B gene is associated with an Alzheimer's disease (AD) like phenotype, has not been studied. With this study, we aimed to investigate the mutation frequency of the major AD and FTD genes and the PRKAR1B gene in a well-defined Dutch cohort of patients with early onset dementia. Mutation analysis of the genes PSEN1, APP, MAPT, GRN, C9orf72 and PRKAR1B was performed on DNA of 229 patients with the clinical diagnosis AD and 74 patients with the clinical diagnosis FTD below the age of 70 years. PSEN1 and APP mutations were found in, respectively 3.5 and 0.4 % of AD patients, and none in FTD patients. C9orf72 repeat expansions were present in 0.4 % of AD and in 9.9 % of FTD patients, whereas MAPT and GRN mutations both were present in 0.4 % in AD patients, and in 1.4 % resp. 2.7 % in FTD patients. We did not find any pathogenic mutations in the PRKAR1B gene. PSEN1 mutations are the most common genetic cause in Dutch AD patients, whereas MAPT and GRN mutations were found in less than 5 percent. C9orf72 repeat expansions were the most common genetic defect in FTD patients. No pathogenic PRKAR1B mutations were found in the early onset AD and FTD patients of our study."
3992413,"Myotonic dystrophy is a disabling multisystem disorder which appears to be more common in South Africa than is generally recognized. Twenty white kindreds with the disease were studied; of these 4 large kindreds had a common ancestry. Genealogical data for 1 527 individuals were acquired. The minimum prevalence of myotonic dystrophy in the northern Transvaal was found to be 14,3/100 000 of the population. Recognition of the disorder is important since some of its complications are preventable and others potentially treatable."
21126241,"The aims of this study were to identify all people with Lesch-Nyhan disease (LND) born in the UK between 1988 and 2008, and to obtain a clinical profile including age at diagnosis, genetic background, family history, neurological signs, and medications.Potential participants were contacted through the British Paediatric Neurology Surveillance Unit. Questionnaires were sent to each child's paediatric neurologist or primary consultant. Two purine laboratories provided metabolic information.Twenty-three live males with LND in the 0- to 20-year age band and eight live males over the age of 20 years were identified. Thirty-one live people with LND were identified in the UK in 2008, giving a prevalence of 1 in 2 million people. Over the 20 years of study, there was a mean incidence rate of 0.18 per 100 000 live births, range 0 to 0.5.To our knowledge, this study is the first to provide details of the prevalence and incidence of LND in the UK. The data highlight that clinical profiles, at the time of diagnosis, and management of the disease are variable. There is the need for ongoing monitoring of allopurinol dosage and metabolic screening."
20039767,"BACKGROUND: Anencephaly is a neural tube defect incompatible with life. The aim of this prospective study was to determine the prevalence of anencephaly in Gorgan, northern Iran. METHODS: During 1998 - 2005, 49,534 newborns at Dezyani hospital in Gorgan were screened for neural tube defects. Clinical and demographic data of the diagnosed cases were recorded in a pre-designed questionnaire for analysis. These data included sex, ethnicity, parental consanguinity, and residential area. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of neural tube defects and anencephaly were 28 and 12 per 10000 births, respectively. The prevalence of anencephaly was 11 and 12 per 10000 births in male and female newborns, respectively. Considering the parental ethnicity, the prevalence of anencephaly was 12, 16, and 7 per 10000 in Fars, Turkman, and Sistani ethnicity, respectively. The prevalence of anencephaly was 13.1/10000 in newborns with mothers aged >35 years. Consanguinity was seen in 36% of the parents. The highest rate of anencephaly occurred in 1999 (23/10000) and the least was in 2003 (2/10000). The most prevalent season for the occurrence of anencephaly was winter (16/10000). CONCLUSION: The present study indicated that the prevalence of anencephaly among Iranian newborns in northern Iran was higher than in the European population."
21495856,"In 2007, Romania, the largest southeastern European country, reported the highest notification rate of botulism cases in the European Union (0.18 per 100,000 inhabitants), which was 18 times higher than the reported rate in the United States (0.01 per 100,000 inhabitants). This report aims to analyze published and unpublished surveillance data on foodborne botulism in Romania from 1980 to 2009 in the context of political and economical changes that occurred in the former communist countries. The mean annual incidence rate of botulism cases was significantly lower during the late communist period, 1980-1989 (0.06±0.03 cases per 100,000 inhabitants), than during the years 1990-1999 (0.1±0.04 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, p=0.01) and 2000-2009 (0.12±0.04 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, p<0.01). The highest incidence rates were registered in 1998 and 2007 (0.18 cases per 100,000 inhabitants), whereas the lowest incidence rate was registered in 1983 (0.02 cases per 100,000 inhabitants). The disease was usually associated with the consumption of home prepared meat products (mainly raw sausages, smoked-dried meat). Most of the laboratory-confirmed cases tested positive for type B toxin (99%). During 2007-2009, the incidence was particularly high in northwestern and western Romania (0.5 and 0.3 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, respectively). The fatality rate was 60% before 1995 and decreased to 12.2±8.5% during 1999-2009. The general ascending trend of infection rates throughout the period studied demonstrates the need for the implementation of correct public health and educational measures to fully prevent this severe disease."
12031004,"OBJECTIVE:Newborn screening for congenital hypothyroidism began in Western Australia in 1981. We describe the epidemiology, including trends over time. METHODOLOGY:Population-based registers and databases were used to identify cases of congenital hypothyroidism in 1981-1998 (n = 126), a random sample of controls (n = 1260), and descriptive data on cases and controls. The prevalence of congenital hypothyroidism per 10 000 live births was calculated, and a case-control analysis conducted. RESULTS:The prevalence of congenital hypothyroidism was 1.74 per 10 000 in the period 1981-1987, compared with 3.54 per 10 000 between 1988 and 1998. Infants identified with congenital hypothyroidism were significantly more likely to have other birth defects (particularly heart defects), be female, have a birthweight heavier than 4500 g, and be born either preterm or after 41 weeks gestation. No cases had cerebral palsy or intellectual disability. CONCLUSIONS:Population-based registers and linked databases can provide very useful information for evaluating screening programmes, and extending our knowledge of the epidemiology of congenital hypothyroidism."
17172462,"X-linked retinoschisis is the leading cause of macular degeneration in males and leads to splitting within the inner retinal layers leading to visual deterioration. Many missense and protein truncating mutations have now been identified in the causative retinoschisis gene (RS1) which encodes a 224 amino acid secretory retinal protein, retinoschisin. Retinoschisin octamerisation is implicated in cell-cell interactions and cell adhesion perhaps by interacting with beta2 laminin. Mutations cause loss of retinoschisin function by one of the three mechanisms: by interfering with protein secretion, by preventing its octamerisation or by reducing function in the secreted octamerised protein. The development of retinoschisis mouse models have provided a model system that closely resembles the human disease. Recent reports of RS1 gene transfer to these models and the sustained restoration of some retinal function and morphology suggest gene replacement may be a possible future therapy for patients."
7273467,"Sjögren-Larsson syndrome (SLS), originally described in Sweden, has been studied in a countrywide survey. A total of 58 SLS patients in 41 families were traced, 35 of them still alive. Thirty patients, 23 alive and seven deceased, have not been reported earlier. The mean incidences per 100,000 in the years 1901-1977 were 0.6 in the whole of Sweden, 10.2 in the county of Västerbotten and 2.7 per 100,000 in the county of Norrbotten. In the above-mentioned areas, the prevalence figures of SLS on 31st December 1978 were estimated to be 0.4, 8.3 and 2.6 per 100,000 persons, the frequencies of SLS gene carriers 0.5, 2.0 and 1.0%, and the gene frequencies 0.002, 0.010 and 0.005, respectively. Of the 58 identified Swedish SLS patients, 45 were born in a restricted area in the northeast of Sweden."
22361014,"The rarity or the asymptomatic character of endocrine tumours results in a lack of epidemiological studies on their incidence and survival patterns. The aim of this study was to describe the incidence, prevalence and survival of endocrine tumours using a large database, which includes cancer patients diagnosed from 1978 to 2002, registered in 89 population-based cancer registries (CRs) with follow-up until 31st December 2003. These data give an unique overview of the burden of endocrine carcinomas in Europe. A list of tumour entities based on the third International Classification of Diseases for Oncology was provided by the project Surveillance of rare cancer in Europe (RARECARE) project. Over 33,594 cases of endocrine carcinomas were analysed in this study. Incidence rates increased with age and were highest in patients 65 years of age or older. In 2003, more than 315,000 persons in the EU (27 countries) were alive with a past diagnosis of a carcinoma of endocrine organs. The incidence of pituitary carcinoma equalled four per 1,000,000 person years and showed the strongest decline in survival with increasing age. Thyroid cancer showed the highest crude incidence rates (four per 100,000 person years) and was the only entity with a gender difference: (female-to-male ratio: 2:9). Parathyroid carcinoma was the rarest endocrine entity with two new cases per 10,000,000 person years. For adrenal carcinoma, the most remarkable observations were a higher survival for women compared to men (40% compared to 32%, respectively) and a particularly low relative survival of 24% in patients 65 years of age or older. More high quality studies on rare cancers, with additional information, e.g. on stage and therapeutic approach, are needed and may be of help in partly explaining the observed variation in survival."

365706,"Data for 331 cri du chat cases, including 34 Danish probands, are reviewed. The incidence nad the prevalence among the mentally retarded population amounted to 1/45,000 and 1.5/1000, respectively. No striking association with prenatal events, parental ages, or birth order could be demonstrated. There was  a significant excess of females. Parental translocations were present in slightly more than 10% of the families, while more rare cytogenetic aberrations (mosaicism, rings, and de novo translocations) accounted for less than 10% of all cases. The phenotypically relevant segment has been narrowed down to the midportion of the 5p15 band. Clinical, radiologic, and dermatoglyphic features are summarized and discussed, with special attention to the abnormal cry, which persists in many older probands, and to developmental abnormalities. No obvious correlation could be detected between clinical features and the localization of the deletion. No marker locus has yet been assigned to the short arm of chromosome 5. Treatment and prevention are briefly discussed."
8027127,"We established a database of hereditary multiple exostoses for the state of Washington, on the basis of a retrospective review of the medical records and a clinical evaluation of family members, to determine the prevalence, clinical range of expression, and rate of malignant degeneration. The database comprised forty-six kindreds with 113 affected members; all kindreds had at least one member living in the state of Washington. The over-all prevalence was at least one in 50,000. Approximately 10 per cent of the subjects had no family history of multiple exostoses. With the use of twenty-three pedigrees that demonstrated an adequate multigenerational history for determination of penetrance of the gene, we identified one unaffected individual among twenty-six obligate heterozygotes, a rate of penetrance of 96 per cent. There was no evidence for a substantial reduction of penetrance in female subjects. The median age at the time of the diagnosis in the 113 affected individuals was three years (range, birth to twelve years). In a cohort of eighty-four subjects for whom we had complete information, the clinical range of expression was wide: thirty-three (39 per cent) had an obvious deformity of the forearm, eight (10 per cent) had an inequality in the lengths of the limbs, seven (8 per cent) had an angular deformity of the knee, and two (2 per cent) had a deformity of the ankle. The average number of operations for the patients for whom the operative history was known was two.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

10025778,"BACKGROUND:We conducted a prospective, population-based study of ALS in the Republic of Ireland for the 3-year period 1995 to 1997. METHODS:To ensure complete case ascertainment, multiple sources of information were used, including consultant neurologists, neurophysiologists, primary care physicians, and the Irish Motor Neuron Disease Association. The El Escorial diagnostic criteria for ALS were applied to all cases enrolled on the register and each patient was regularly followed up during his or her illness. RESULTS:Between January 1, 1995, and December 31, 1997, 231 patients were diagnosed with possible, probable, or definite ALS, including 133 men (57.6%) and 98 women (42.4%). The average annual incidence rate was 2.1 per 100,000 person-years (95% CI, 1.8 to 2.4), and 2.8 per 100,000 person-years for the population older than 15 years (95% CI, 2.4 to 3.1). The incidence rate was higher for men, being 2.5 per 100,000 person-years (95% CI, 2.0 to 2.9), than for women, at 1.8 per 100,000 person-years (95% CI, 1.5 to 2.2), and increased with age for both sexes. The median age at onset was 64.2 years for men and 67.8 years for women. On December 31, 1996, the crude prevalence was 4.7 per 100,000 of the total population (95% CI, 4.0 to 5.5), and 6.2 per 100,000 for the population older than 15 years (95% CI, 5.3 to 7.1). Adjusting to the 1996 Irish population as standard, the incidence of ALS in Ireland during the 3-year study period is the third highest reported to date. CONCLUSIONS:There was a trend toward a higher incidence of ALS in the northwestern region of Ireland, although the numbers of cases involved were small and further study is required."
21533827,"Alexander disease (AxD) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder characterized by white matter degeneration and formation of cytoplasmic inclusions. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) mutations have been reported in various forms of AxD since 2001. However, a definitive diagnosis remains difficult because of uncertain prevalence, and different clinical features seen in infantile AxD and adult AxD may lead to confusion and misdiagnosis. Here we report an epidemiological study conducted in Japan. Two nationwide questionnaire-based surveys were conducted using tentative diagnostic criteria. We gathered information regarding prevalence, neurological findings, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, electrophysiological findings, genetic information, and the results of therapeutic interventions and home care. Prevalence of various forms of AxD was determined as 27.3% (infantile), 24.2% (juvenile), and 48.5% (adult). Prevalence of AxD in Japan was estimated to be approximately 1 case per 2.7 million individuals. The main characteristics of infantile and juvenile AxD include delayed psychomotor development or mental retardation, convulsions, macrocephaly, and predominant cerebral white matter abnormalities in the frontal lobe on brain MRI. The main characteristics of adult AxD include bulbar signs, muscle weakness with hyperreflexia, and signal abnormalities and/or atrophy of medulla oblongata and cervical spinal cord on MRI. To ensure correct diagnosis of AxD, the physician should understand the importance of the process of GFAP genetic testing, which provides definitive diagnosis. Therefore, we propose new clinical guidelines for diagnosing AxD based on simplified classifications: cerebral AxD (type 1), bulbospinal AxD (type 2), and intermediate form (type 3)."
20506663,"OBJECTIVE: To study the epidemiological and clinical features of congenital split hand/split foot malformation (SHFM) in Chinese population. METHODS: Data used in this study were provided by the Chinese Birth Defects Monitoring Network. The SHFM cases were categorized into two groups: isolated (SHFM only and SHFM with other limb defects) and syndromic (SHFM with non-limb defects). Prevalence rates were calculated by residential area (urban versus rural) and by gender. Further analyses were conducted to identify the characteristics of SHFM with related to gestational age, birth weight, perinatal outcome and affected limbs. RESULTS: A total of 736 newborn babies were identified with SHFM among 4,489,692 births, with a prevalence of 1.64/10,000. The prevalence of isolated SHFM and syndromic SHFM were 0.64 and 1.00 per 10,000 births, respectively. The prevalence of SHFM in male and female babies were 1.79 and 1.25 per 10,000 births, respectively. The prevalence of SHFM in urban and rural areas were 1.51 and 1.86 per 10,000 births, respectively. Preterm birth and low birth weight accounted for 30.20% and 43.93% of the SHFM cases, respectively. The perinatal mortality for the SHFM, isolated SHFM, and syndromic SHFM were 50.27%, 24.74%, and 66.59%, respectively. SHFM occurred more often in upper limbs. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of SHFM in Chinese population is greater than foreign populations. The high perinatal mortality rate of SHFM is associated with the severity of accompanied malformations."
8826887,"The U.K. Diamond-Blackfan Anaemia (DBA) Registry was established with the aim of providing a representative database for studies on the aetiology, pathophysiology and treatment of DBA. We have analysed retrospective data from 80 cases (33 male, 47 female) born in the U.K. in a 20-year period (1975-94), representing an annual incidence of 5 per million live births. Ten children from seven families had an apparently familial disorder. 13% were anaemic at birth, and 72.5% had presented by the age of 3 months. 67% had macrocytosis at presentation. 72% responded initially to steroids, and at the time of study 61% were transfusion-independent (45% steroid-dependent) and 39% required regular transfusions. Unequivocal physical anomalies, predominantly craniofacial, were present in 37%, and were more likely in boys (52%) than girls (25%). 18% had thumb abnormalities. Height was below the third centile for age in 28%, and 31% had neither short stature nor physical anomalies. Four children without physical abnormalities had normal red cell indices, and achieved steroid-independent remission, suggesting transient erythroblastopenia of childhood rather than DBA. The birth month distribution of children with sporadic DBA and craniofacial dysmorphism showed a possible seasonality, consistent with a viral aetiology."
21902819,"Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is defined by the triad of mechanical hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia and renal impairment. Atypical HUS (aHUS) defines non Shiga-toxin-HUS and even if some authors include secondary aHUS due to Streptococcus pneumoniae or other causes, aHUS designates a primary disease due to a disorder in complement alternative pathway regulation. Atypical HUS represents 5 -10% of HUS in children, but the majority of HUS in adults. The incidence of complement-aHUS is not known precisely. However, more than 1000 aHUS patients investigated for complement abnormalities have been reported. Onset is from the neonatal period to the adult age. Most patients present with hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia and renal failure and 20% have extra renal manifestations. Two to 10% die and one third progress to end-stage renal failure at first episode. Half of patients have relapses. Mutations in the genes encoding complement regulatory proteins factor H, membrane cofactor protein (MCP), factor I or thrombomodulin have been demonstrated in 20-30%, 5-15%, 4-10% and 3-5% of patients respectively, and mutations in the genes of C3 convertase proteins, C3 and factor B, in 2-10% and 1-4%. In addition, 6-10% of patients have anti-factor H antibodies. Diagnosis of aHUS relies on 1) No associated disease 2) No criteria for Shigatoxin-HUS (stool culture and PCR for Shiga-toxins; serology for anti-lipopolysaccharides antibodies) 3) No criteria for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (serum ADAMTS 13 activity > 10%). Investigation of the complement system is required (C3, C4, factor H and factor I plasma concentration, MCP expression on leukocytes and anti-factor H antibodies; genetic screening to identify risk factors). The disease is familial in approximately 20% of pedigrees, with an autosomal recessive or dominant mode of transmission. As penetrance of the disease is 50%, genetic counseling is difficult. Plasmatherapy has been first line treatment until presently, without unquestionable demonstration of efficiency. There is a high risk of post-transplant recurrence, except in MCP-HUS. Case reports and two phase II trials show an impressive efficacy of the complement C5 blocker eculizumab, suggesting it will be the next standard of care. Except for patients treated by intensive plasmatherapy or eculizumab, the worst prognosis is in factor H-HUS, as mortality can reach 20% and 50% of survivors do not recover renal function. Half of factor I-HUS progress to end-stage renal failure. Conversely, most patients with MCP-HUS have preserved renal function. Anti-factor H antibodies-HUS has favourable outcome if treated early."
23972786,"A key question for urea cycle disorders is their incidence. In the United States two UCDs, argininosuccinic synthetase and lyase deficiency, are currently detected by newborn screening. We used newborn screening data on over 6million births and data from the large US and European longitudinal registries to determine how common these conditions are. The incidence for the United States is predicted to be 1 urea cycle disorder patient for every 35,000 births presenting about 113 new patients per year across all age groups."

The aim of the study was to determine the incidence rates of dermatomyositis-polymyositis and their distribution in our country. MATERIAL AND METHOD:Observational and descriptive study. Data was obtained from hospital discharge code (CMBD) during the period 1997-2004. Sex, region and age were analysed. Raw and standardized incidence rates for each region studied were calculated as new cases/million population/year with 95% confidence interval (CI). Trend odds ratio (OR) was calculated by means of a logistic regression. RESULTS:Global incidence rate in polymyositis-dermatomyositis was 8.9 new cases/million population/year (CI 95%, 8.6-9.2); 3.9 (CI 95%, 3.7-4.1) for polymyositis and 4.9 (CI 95%, 4.7-5.2) for dermatomyositis. Rate differences between both diseases reached statistical significance (p < 0.001). Annual incidence rate decreased significantly across the period studied in both diseases with a trend OR of 0.95 (CI 95%, 0.93-0.97; p < 0.001) in dermatomyositis and 0.96 (CI 95%, 0.93-0.97; p < 0.001) in polymyositis. Both diseases were significantly more frequent in females (p < 0.001). The incidence rates for each region varies between 2.2 and 10.6 cases/million population/year in polymyositis and between 2.9 and 8.6 cases/million population/year in dermatomyositis. CONCLUSIONS:Incidence of dermatomyositis-polymyositis in Spain is similar to other countries. Decreased incidence observed across the period and the higher incidence of dermatomyositis could be explained because of a better diagnosis of these entities."
21587099,"Modifications to diagnostic criteria and introduction of genetic testing have likely affected the pattern and timing of Rett syndrome diagnosis. The trends in incidence and prevalence of Rett syndrome in Australia were examined; the cumulative risk of a female being diagnosed was determined; and the impact of changes to diagnostic criteria and availability of genetic testing on these frequencies was investigated. The population-based Australian Rett Syndrome Database was used to identify a total of 349 verified Rett syndrome females born 1976-2006 and diagnosed 1982-2008. The proportion of female cases born and diagnosed per year and the cumulative risk of a diagnosis were determined. The median age of Rett syndrome diagnosis decreased from 4.5 y if diagnosed before 2000 to 3.5 y if diagnosed after 1999. The cumulative risk of diagnosis had almost doubled by 32 y of age [1/8,905 or 11.23 per 100,000 person-years (95% CI, 10.03-12.45)] in comparison with 5 y of age [1/15,361 or 6.51 per 100,000 person-years (95% CI, 5.65-7.39)]. Earlier age of diagnosis may result in families experiencing less stress and emotional strain compared with those with delayed diagnosis."
19783099,"Facial pain has a considerable impact on quality of life. Accurate incidence estimates in the general population are scant. The aim was therefore to estimate the incidence rate (IR) of trigeminal neuralgia (TGN), postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), cluster headache (CH), occipital neuralgia (ON), local neuralgia (LoN), atypical facial pain (AFP), glossopharyngeal neuralgia (GPN) and paroxysmal hemicrania (PH) in the Netherlands. In the population-based Integrated Primary Care Information (IPCI) medical record database potential facial pain cases were identified from codes and narratives. Two medical doctors reviewed medical records, questionnaires from general practitioners and specialist letters using criteria of the International Association for the Study of Pain. A pain specialist arbitrated if necessary and a random sample of all cases was evaluated by a neurologist. The date of onset was defined as date of first specific symptoms. The IR was calculated per 100,000PY. Three hundred and sixty-two incident cases were ascertained. The overall IR [95% confidence interval] was 38.7 [34.9-42.9]. It was more common among women compared to men. Trigeminal neuralgia and cluster headache were the most common forms among the studied diseases. Paroxysmal hemicrania and glossopharyngeal neuralgia were among the rarer syndromes. The IR increased with age for all diseases except CH and ON, peaking in the 4th and 7th decade, respectively. Postherpetic neuralgia, CH and LoN were more common in men than women. From this we can conclude that facial pain is relatively rare, although more common than estimated previously based on hospital data."
3652488,"The incidence of all diagnosed cases of familial dysautonomia in Israel among Ashkenazi Jews from 1977-1981 was 27/100,000 or 1/3703. This incidence is higher than that previously reported in Israel in 1967 or 8.3/100,000 (1/12,048) (Moses et al. 1967). It is also higher than that of North American Ashkenazi Jews in 1970, when the rate was 5-10/100,000 (1/10,000-20,000) (Brunt & McKusick 1970). This higher incidence could be explained by current awareness of the diagnosis, or by the emergence of more cases."
20424236,"BACKGROUND: Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare skin cancer that was recently found to be associated with a polyomavirus and with immunosuppression, provoking new interest in its epidemiology. We conducted a nationwide study in Denmark to describe MCC incidence and mortality and the association between MCC and other cancers. METHODS: We used data from Danish national health and population registers on MCC diagnoses, deaths, and population counts during the study period (1978-2006) to calculate MCC incidence rates, cumulative risks of MCC at age 100 years, and MCC mortality rates by tumor stage. We used Poisson regression to estimate the excess mortality rate ratio attributable to MCC and examined associations between MCC and other cancers diagnosed before and after the MCC diagnosis using standardized incidence rate ratios (SIRs). All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Between January 1, 1978, and December 31, 2006, 185 persons were diagnosed with MCC in Denmark. MCC incidence between 1995 and 2006 was 2.2 cases per million person-years. In the first year after MCC diagnosis, 22% of persons with localized disease died compared with 54% of patients with nonlocalized disease; by 5 years after diagnosis, the proportions of MCC patients who had died increased to 55% and 84%, respectively. MCC incidence was statistically significantly increased more than 1 year after a diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin (SIR = 14.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 8.4 to 25.6), basal cell carcinoma (SIR = 4.3, 95% CI = 2.7 to 6.6), malignant melanoma (SIR = 3.3, 95% CI = 1.1 to 10.3), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (SIR = 12.0, 95% CI = 3.8 to 37.8), Hodgkin lymphoma (SIR = 17.6, 95% CI = 2.5 to 126), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (SIR = 5.6, 95% CI = 1.4 to 22.4). Squamous cell carcinoma (SIR = 12.1, 95% CI = 5.1 to 29.1) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (SIR = 14.7, 95% CI = 3.7 to 58.8) occurred in statistically significant excess more than 1 year after MCC diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: These results support the existence of shared risk factors for MCC and other cancers. Heightened awareness of the association between MCC and other cancers, particularly squamous cell carcinoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, may facilitate earlier clinical detection and treatment of MCC, thereby improving patient survival."
21860665,"Circulating strains of Staphylococcus aureus (SA) have changed in the last 30 years including the emergence of community-associated methicillin-resistant SA (MRSA). A report suggested staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome (TSS) was increasing over 2000-2003. The last population-based assessment of TSS was 1986.Population-based active surveillance for TSS meeting the CDC definition using ICD-9 codes was conducted in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area (population 2,642,056) from 2000-2006. Medical records of potential cases were reviewed for case criteria, antimicrobial susceptibility, risk factors, and outcome. Superantigen PCR testing and PFGE were performed on available isolates from probable and confirmed cases.Of 7,491 hospitalizations that received one of the ICD-9 study codes, 61 TSS cases (33 menstrual, 28 non-menstrual) were identified. The average annual incidence per 100,000 of all, menstrual, and non-menstrual TSS was 0.52 (95% CI, 0.32-0.77), 0.69 (0.39-1.16), and 0.32 (0.12-0.67), respectively. Women 13-24 years had the highest incidence at 1.41 (0.63-2.61). No increase in incidence was observed from 2000-2006. MRSA was isolated in 1 menstrual and 3 non-menstrual cases (7% of TSS cases); 1 isolate was USA400. The superantigen gene tst-1 was identified in 20 (80%) of isolates and was more common in menstrual compared to non-menstrual isolates (89% vs. 50%, p = 0.07). Superantigen genes sea, seb and sec were found more frequently among non-menstrual compared to menstrual isolates [100% vs 25% (p = 0.4), 60% vs 0% (p<0.01), and 25% vs 13% (p = 0.5), respectively].TSS incidence remained stable across our surveillance period of 2000-2006 and compared to past population-based estimates in the 1980s. MRSA accounted for a small percentage of TSS cases. tst-1 continues to be the superantigen associated with the majority of menstrual cases. The CDC case definition identifies the most severe cases and has been consistently used but likely results in a substantial underestimation of the total TSS disease burden."
21122460,"INTRODUCTION: Few population-based studies exist on incidence, risk of infection and mortality in hairy cell leukaemia (HCL). MATERIAL AND METHODS: We used population-based medical databases to identify 209 patients who were diagnosed with HCL in the period from January 1997 to August 2007 in Denmark. An age- and sex-matched comparison cohort of 2,090 persons was selected from the general population. We computed the incidence of HCL using demographic data. Hospitalizations with pneumonia and bacteraemia were determined from the Danish National Patient Registry. Cox regression analysis was used to estimate the relative risk (RR) of infection and mortality ratios (MRR) adjusting for age, sex and comorbidity. RESULTS: The HCL incidence rates were 1.97 (95% confidence interval 1.51-2.53) and 5.37 (4.57-6.28) per million person-years for women and men, respectively. During a median follow-up of 4.5 years, 48 HCL patients were hospitalized with pneumonia or bacteraemia. The adjusted RR of infection was 8.04 (4.99-12.95) the first year after diagnosis and 1.17 (0.71-1.94) for the remaining follow-up period. The adjusted MRRs were 4.26 (2.61-6.96) and 1.12 (0.75-1.65) the first year after diagnosis and the remaining follow-up period, respectively. CONCLUSION: In the second and subsequent years after HCL diagnosis, the risk of infection and mortality was similar to that of the general population."
20435624,"BACKGROUND: Inherited bone marrow failure syndromes are rare genetic disorders characterized by bone marrow failure, congenital anomalies, and cancer predisposition. Available single disease registries provide reliable information regarding natural history, efficacy and side effects of treatments, and contribute to the discovery of the causative genes. However, these registries could not shed light on the true incidence of the various syndromes. We, therefore, established an Israeli national registry in order to investigate the relative frequency of each of these syndromes and their complications. DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients were registered by their hematologists in all 16 medical centers in Israel. We included patients with Fanconi anemia, severe congenital neutropenia, Diamond-Blackfan anemia, congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia, dyskeratosis congenita, Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, and thrombocytopenia with absent radii. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-seven patients diagnosed between 1966 and 2007 were registered. Fifty-two percent were found to have Fanconi anemia, 17% severe congenital neutropenia, 14% Diamond-Blackfan anemia, 6% congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia, 5% dyskeratosis congenita, 2% Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, and 2% thrombocytopenia with absent radii. No specific diagnosis was made in only 2 patients. Of the thirty patients (24%) developing severe bone marrow failure, 80% had Fanconi anemia. Seven of 9 patients with leukemia had Fanconi anemia, as did all 6 with solid tumors. Thirty-four patients died from their disease; 25 (74%) had Fanconi anemia and 6 (17%) had severe congenital neutropenia. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first comprehensive population-based study evaluating the incidence and complications of the different inherited bone marrow failure syndromes. By far the most common disease was Fanconi anemia, followed by severe congenital neutropenia and Diamond-Blackfan anemia. Fanconi anemia carried the worst prognosis, with severe bone marrow failure and cancer susceptibility. Diamond-Blackfan anemia had the best prognosis. The data presented provide a rational basis for prevention programs and longitudinal surveillance of the complications of inherited bone marrow failure syndromes."
15906732,"A multicenter cooperative investigated the incidence of Phenylketonuria (PKU) in the central, southern and western areas of Guangdong province and its surrounding districts. Tests to measure phenylalanine (Phe) on dried blood spots on filter paper cards used BIA and thefluorescence assay. Four hundred sixty-one thousand eight hundred five (461,805) newborns were screened and 14 cases of persistent hyperphenylalaninemia (PHPA) were detected. The incidence of PHPA was 1/33,000, including 1/77,000 for classical PKU; 1 in 66,000 for hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) and 1 in 461,805 for BH4 deficiency. A high variation in PKU incidence in the different districts was observed. The differences may be attributed to the variations in gene frequency of PKU in the different districts and to bioethical consideration especially as regards reproduction in different areas."
19129744,"In 1992, the U.S. Public Health Service recommended that all women of childbearing age consume 400 microg of folic acid daily to help prevent pregnancies affected by neural tube defects (NTDs) such as spina bifida. Subsequently, the Food and Drug Administration mandated adding folic acid to all enriched cereal grain products by January 1998. During October 1998--December 1999, the birth prevalence of spina bifida in the United States decreased 22.9% compared with 1995--1996; however, by 2003--2004, no further decrease had been observed. Notably, the prevalence of NTD-affected pregnancies remained higher among Hispanic women than among women in other racial/ethnic populations. To update previously reported data and assess racial/ethnic differences, CDC analyzed birth certificate data for four periods during 1995--2005. This report summarizes the results of that analysis, which indicated that from the early postfortification period, 1999--2000, to the most recent period of analysis, 2003--2005, the prevalence of spina bifida declined 6.9%, from 2.04 to 1.90 per 10,000 live births (prevalence ratio [PR] = 0.93; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.87--1.00). Among infants with non-Hispanic black mothers, prevalence fell 19.8%, from 2.17 to 1.74 per 10,000 live births (PR = 0.80; CI = 0.67--0.96), while prevalence among infants with non-Hispanic white and Hispanic mothers remained nearly constant. Additional public health efforts targeting women with known risk factors (e.g., obesity and certain genetic factors) likely are needed to further reduce the prevalence of spina bifida in the United States."
17084977,"The complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a painful disorder that can occur in an extremity after any type of injury, or even spontaneously. Data on the incidence of CRPS are scarce and mostly hospital based. Therefore the size of the problem and its burden on health care and society are unknown. The objective of the present study was to estimate the incidence of CRPS in the general population. A retrospective cohort study was conducted during 1996-2005 in the Integrated Primary Care Information (IPCI) project, a general practice research database with electronic patient record data from 600,000 patients throughout The Netherlands. Potential CRPS cases were identified by a sensitive search algorithm including synonyms and abbreviations for CRPS. Subsequently, cases were validated by electronic record review, supplemented with original specialist letters and information from an enquiry of general practitioners. The estimated overall incidence rate of CRPS was 26.2 per 100,000 person years (95% CI: 23.0-29.7). Females were affected at least three times more often than males (ratio: 3.4). The highest incidence occurred in females in the age category of 61-70 years. The upper extremity was affected more frequently than the lower extremity and a fracture was the most common precipitating event (44%). The observed incidence rate of CRPS is more as four times higher than the incidence rate observed in the only other population-based study, performed in Olmsted County, USA. Postmenopausal woman appeared to be at the highest risk for the development of CRPS."
17181917,"To estimate the annual incidence and prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), juvenile arthritis (JIA) and gout in a population based study in two regions of the Czech Republic with total population of 186,000 inhabitants.The study was conducted in the Town of Ceske Budejovice and district of Cheb in the Czech Republic (with a total population of 186,000 inhabitants) in the years 2002 and 2003. Incident cases were registered on condition that the definite diagnosis was confirmed according to existing classification criteria during the study period. Prevalence was studied on the basis of identification of established diagnosis from registers of patients of participating rheumatologists and other specialists. They were asked to report all living patients who had been diagnosed before 1st March 2002. Patients were only included in the study if their permanent address was in the selected study area.Overall, we found 48 incident and 947 prevalent cases of RA among adults (16+ years), 4 incident and 43 prevalent cases of JIA among children (less than 16 years old), and 64 incident and 425 prevalent cases of gout among adults (16+ years). The total annual incidence of RA was 31/100,000 in the adult population aged 16 years and more (95% CI 20 to 42/100,000). The prevalence of RA was 610/100,000 (95% CI 561 to 658/100,000) in the adult population. An annual incidence of gout in adults was 41/100,000 (95% CI 28 to 53/100,000). The prevalence of gout was 300/100,000 (95% CI 266 to 334/100,000). The annual incidence of JIA was 13/100,000 in children less than 16 years old (95%CI 1 to 20/100,000). The prevalence of JIA in children was 140/100,000 (95% CI 117 to 280/100,000).This study estimates the annual incidence and prevalence rates of RA, gout and JIA in the first population-based survey in the Czech Republic. The rates of RA and JIA compare well with figures reported from other countries; figures in gout seem to be lower than reported elsewhere."
11561964,"To estimate the burden of disease due to congenital toxoplasmosis in Sweden the incidence of primary infections during pregnancy and birth prevalence of congenital toxoplasmosis in 40,978 children born in two regions in Sweden was determined. Women possibly infected during pregnancy were identified based on: 1, detection of specific IgG based on neonatal screening of the phenylketonuria (PKU) card blood spot followed by retrospective testing of stored prenatal samples to detect women who acquired infection during pregnancy and follow up of their children to 12 months: 2, detection of specific IgM on the PKU blood spot. The birth prevalence of congenital toxoplasmosis was 0.73/10,000 (95 % CI 0.15-2.14) (3/40,978). The incidence of primary infection during pregnancy was 5.1/10,000 (95% CI 2.6-8.9) susceptible pregnant women. The seroprevalence in the southern part was 25.7% and in the Stockholm area 14.0%. The incidence of infection during pregnancy was low, as the birth prevalence of congenital toxoplasmosis. Neonatal screening warrants consideration in view of the low cost and feasibility."
25532075,"BACKGROUND: Determining the prevalence of neuromuscular disorders for the general population is important to identify the scope of burden on society and enable comparisons with other health conditions. This systematic review aims to identify and collate the findings of studies published between 1960 and 2013 on the prevalence of all types of muscular dystrophies. SUMMARY: Relevant articles were identified through electronic database searches and manual searches of reference lists. There were 38 articles from across 19 countries that met the inclusion criteria. The total combined prevalence for all muscular dystrophies for studies classified as having a low risk of bias ranged between 19.8 and 25.1 per 100,000 person-years. Myotonic dystrophy (0.5-18.1 per 100,000), Duchenne muscular dystrophy (1.7-4.2) and facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (3.2-4.6 per 100,000) were found to be the most common types of disorder. There was wide variation in study methodology, case ascertainment, and verification procedures and populations studied, all of which may contribute to the wide prevalence range, in addition to the likely variation in prevalence by country. Key Messages: Greater consistency in the conduct and reporting of neuroepidemiological studies is urgently needed to enable comparisons to be made between studies, countries, and over time."
8151638,"This study in north east Scotland has shown that Marfan syndrome has a minimal birth incidence of 1:9802 live births, a minimal prevalence of 1:14217, and that 8/30 (26.7%) of cases in our series are new mutations. The calculated mutation rate is 15 +/- 6.7 x 10(-6) and there is evidence of reduced reproductive fitness."
7555969,"We performed a retrospective study of infantile spasms (IS) in 57 children (19 girls and 38 boys) from the east-central region of Sweden for the period 1987-1991. The incidence was 0.45/1,000 newborns a year, with a spread of 0.17-0.76 between the seven counties included. Forty-three cases (75%) were symptomatic and 14 (25%) were idiopathic. Cerebral malformations were diagnosed in 8 children, and chromosomal aberrations were diagnosed in 5. In addition, 2 children each were diagnosed as having tuberous sclerosis and neurofibromatosis. At follow-up, 57% in the idiopathic group had normal development, whereas 91% in the symptomatic group had died or developed a multihandicap. The value of modern neuroradiological techniques for etiological diagnosis is stressed."
21488855,"The prevalence of hypophosphatasia (HP), a rare metabolic disorder due to loss-of-function mutations in the ALPL gene, has never been estimated in the European population. Only one published study evaluated the incidence of severe HP at 1/100,000 in Canada 53 years ago. Moderate forms of hypophosphatasia (mHP), including HP with moderate bone features and the mildest form odontohypophosphatasia, reflect both recessive and dominant inheritance, and are therefore expected to be more frequent than severe forms of HP. Here we estimated both the prevalences of severe and mHP in European populations. The prevalence of severe HP was estimated at 1/300,000 on the basis of the number of cases tested in our laboratory and originating from France during the period 2000-2009. The prevalence of mHP was then estimated by using the proportion of dominant mutations among severe alleles and by estimating the penetrance of the disease in heterozygotes for dominant mutations. According to a genetic model with four alleles resulting in 10 distinct genotypes, the prevalence of dominant mHP in the European population was estimated to be 1/6370, pointing out that mHP is much more frequent than severe HP."
18422594,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS) in a general Turkish population according to the latest proposed American-European Consensus Group (AECG) criteria and European-1 (EU-1) criteria. METHODS: The study was conducted in two districts of Izmir and involved 2835 subjects 20 years of age and older. In the first stage, face-to-face interviews were performed at the registered households. In the second stage, subjects reporting symptoms of both dry eye and dry mouth were invited to the hospital for a full examination, which included Schirmer-1, sialometry and serologic tests. In the third stage, a minor salivary gland biopsy was performed as required. RESULTS: A total of 2887 subjects were contacted and a complete interview was obtained for 2835 (1551 female, 1284 male) subjects. A total of 159 subjects (126 female, 33 male) confirmed oral and ocular dryness, and 86 of these patients (54.1%) underwent a detailed clinical examination in the hospital. pSS was diagnosed in 10 patients (nine females) according to the EU-1 criteria, and in six patients (six females) according to the AECG criteria. We found a minimum crude prevalence of 0.21% [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.03-0.29] in the sample population and an age-sex adjusted prevalence of 0.16% (95% CI: 0.06-0.35), according to AECG criteria. According to EU-1 criteria, these prevalence rates were found to be 0.35% (95% CI: 0.10-0.45) and 0.28% (95% CI: 0.13-0.51) respectively. CONCLUSION: The pSS prevalence rates found in the Turkish population in this study were lower than the estimated prevalence rate in a general population."
24603320,"Hereditary cerebellar ataxias (HCA) and hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSP) are two groups of neurodegenerative disorders that usually present with progressive gait impairment, often leading to permanent disability. Advances in genetic research in the last decades have improved their diagnosis and brought new possibilities for prevention and future treatments. Still, there is great uncertainty regarding their global epidemiology.Our objective was to assess the global distribution and prevalence of HCA and HSP by a systematic review and meta-analysis of prevalence studies. The MEDLINE, ISI Web of Science and Scopus databases were searched (1983-2013) for studies performed in well-defined populations and geographical regions. Two independent reviewers assessed the studies and extracted data and predefined methodological parameters. Overall, 22 studies were included, reporting on 14,539 patients from 16 countries. Multisource population-based studies yielded higher prevalence values than studies based primarily on hospitals or genetic centres. The prevalence range of dominant HCA was 0.0-5.6/10(5), with an average of 2.7/10(5) (1.5-4.0/10(5)). Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3)/Machado-Joseph disease was the most common dominant ataxia, followed by SCA2 and SCA6. The autosomal recessive (AR) HCA (AR-HCA) prevalence range was 0.0-7.2/10(5), the average being 3.3/10(5) (1.8-4.9/10(5)). Friedreich ataxia was the most frequent AR-HCA, followed by ataxia with oculomotor apraxia or ataxia-telangiectasia. The prevalence of autosomal dominant (AD) HSP (AD-HSP) ranged from 0.5 to 5.5/10(5) and that of AR-HSP from 0.0 to 5.3/10(5), with pooled averages of 1.8/10(5) (95% CI: 1.0-2.7/10(5)) and 1.8/10(5) (95% CI: 1.0-2.6/10(5)), respectively. The most common AD-HSP form in every population was spastic paraplegia, autosomal dominant, type 4 (SPG4), followed by SPG3A, while SPG11 was the most frequent AR-HSP, followed by SPG15. In population-based studies, the number of families without genetic diagnosis after systematic testing ranged from 33 to 92% in the AD-HCA group, and was 40-46% in the AR-HCA, 45-67% in the AD-HSP and 71-82% in the AR-HSP groups.Highly variable prevalence values for HCA and HSP are reported across the world. This variation reflects the different genetic make-up of the populations, but also methodological heterogeneity. Large areas of the world remain without prevalence studies. From the available data, we estimated that around 1:10,000 people are affected by HCA or HSP. In spite of advances in genetic research, most families in population-based series remain without identified genetic mutation after extensive testing. © 2014 S. Karger AG, Basel."
27015112,"To provide an epidemiologic description of Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease (KFD), and to describe its relationship with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in a population of sub-Saharan origin.Patients were retrospectively included on the basis of lymph node histology compatible with KFD reported in Martinique from 1991 until 2013. In order to describe the characteristics of the disease in a larger cohort, we subsequently included more patients of Afro-Caribbean origin from Guadeloupe and French Guiana.In Martinique, mean annual incidence between 1991 and 2013 was 2.78 cases for 1 million inhabitants (95% confidence interval 1.73-3.93). A total of 36 Afro-Caribbean patients from the 3 French American regions were included. Mean age was 30.5 years (range 5-59 years) and the female:male ratio was 3:1. The main characteristics were cervical adenopathies (88.8%), fever (83.3%), asthenia (73.0%), weight loss (64.4%), and recurrence in 33.3%. KFD was associated with lupus (n = 9 for SLE, n = 2 for cutaneous lupus) in 36.6% (11 of 30).We report the first epidemiologic description of KFD in a population of sub-Saharan origin. According to our data, this disease is present in the black African diaspora and is strongly associated with autoimmune diseases, particularly lupus."
24125788,"PURPOSE: To analyze the electroclinical features and evolution of patients diagnosed with convulsions with mild gastroenteritis (CwG) from southwest China. METHODS: We reviewed and analyzed the medical records of 34 patients (13 males) diagnosed with CwG and followed-up for at least 12 months. RESULTS: The age of onset was 6-29 months and the female/male ratio 1.62. Seizures were generalized in 32 cases. Single seizures in 15 cases were <5 min and multiple seizures 24-48 h after seizure onset were seen in 18 cases. Seizure duration was <1 min in 32.35%, between 1 and 5 min in 55.88%, and between 5 and 10 min in 8.82% of seizures. The average interval between the onset of gastroenteritis and seizures was 2.47 days. Rotavirus antigen was positive in stools in 26.47% of cases. During the acute phase, diazepam and phenobarbital as first-line treatment were effective in 25% and 83.33% of cases, respectively. Fourteen patients showed non-specific anomalies in the interictal electroencephalography. During 12-36 months follow-up, 33 cases showed normal psychomotor development and no seizures. CONCLUSIONS: CwG occurred mostly in toddlers. During the acute phase, phenobarbital is more effective in controlling seizures. For a good prognosis, it is unnecessary to administrate long-term anticonvulsants."
11949733,"Commencing with the work carried out during the epidemiological survey of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in the period 1980-1992 and the pathology follow-up, we carried out a perspective incidence, prevalence and mortality survey of X-linked bulbar and spinal muscular atrophy (X-BSMA) in the province of Reggio Emilia in Northern Italy. Based on 11 patients (eight familial and three sporadic cases), the mean incidence per year for the period 1980 through 1997, as evaluated at the onset of symptoms, was 0.09 cases/100,000 for the total population and 0.19 cases/100,000 for the male population. On December 31, 1997, the prevalence rate was 1.6/100,000 for the total population and 3.3/100,000 for the male population. In the 18-year period of 1980-1997, the average yearly mortality rate was: 0.03 cases/100,000 per year for the total population and 0.06 cases/ 100,000 for the male population. The average age at onset was 44.8 +/- 10.1, and the average survival period was 27.3 +/- 2.3 years. The average age of the prevalence day was 58.9 +/- 14.9, and the average age at death was 71.3 +/- 4.7 years. Whereas the incidence rate of X-BSMA in the province of Reggio Emilia is 16 times lower that of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the incidence rate of progressive bulbar palsy in the male population is only slightly higher than X-BSMA; and the prevalence rate of ALS for males is two times the prevalence rate for X-BSMA, with overlapping of confidence intervals. X-BSMA is a rare disease, which is probably under-diagnosed, but due to the long survival period of this disease its frequency is not negligible. Because of the presence of sporadic cases or non-evident familial cases, it is appropriate to consider this diagnostic possibility in making a diagnosis of ALS in patients in whom lower motor neuron dysfunction or bulbar onset predominates."
15813653,"Chronic actinic dermatitis is a condition involving abnormal cutaneous photosensitivity to UV and, often, visible wavelengths. It is rare, but more common in the elderly than in younger populations, with an estimated prevalence of one in 2000 in the > or = 75-year-old population in Tayside, Dundee, Scotland. It usually presents as a dermatitis that maximally, but not exclusively, affects photo-exposed skin. Investigation to confirm the diagnosis and guide management includes phototesting and patch testing. The mainstay of treatment is education about the condition and advice on sunlight and allergen avoidance. Topical corticosteroids and emollients are always required, at least intermittently, and it is sometimes necessary to resort to systemic immunosuppression, usually with corticosteroids or azathioprine."
23260189,"Human African trypanosomiasis, or sleeping sickness, is caused by infection with parasites of the genus Trypanosoma, transmitted by the tsetse fly. The disease has two forms, Trypanosoma brucei (T b) rhodesiense and T b gambiense; and is almost always fatal if untreated. Despite a recent reduction in the number of reported cases, patients with African trypanosomiasis continue to present major challenges to clinicians. Because treatment for CNS-stage disease can be very toxic, diagnostic staging to distinguish early-stage from late-stage disease when the CNS in invaded is crucial but remains problematic. Melarsoprol is the only available treatment for late-stage T b rhodesiense infection, but can be lethal to 5% of patients owing to post-treatment reactive encephalopathy. Eflornithine combined with nifurtimox is the first-line treatment for late-stage T b gambiense. New drugs are in the pipeline for treatment of CNS human African trypanosomiasis, giving rise to cautious optimism."
17980020,"Oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) is a group of inherited disorders of melanin biosynthesis characterized by a generalized reduction in pigmentation of hair, skin and eyes. The prevalence of all forms of albinism varies considerably worldwide and has been estimated at approximately 1/17,000, suggesting that about 1 in 70 people carry a gene for OCA. The clinical spectrum of OCA ranges, with OCA1A being the most severe type with a complete lack of melanin production throughout life, while the milder forms OCA1B, OCA2, OCA3 and OCA4 show some pigment accumulation over time. Clinical manifestations include various degrees of congenital nystagmus, iris hypopigmentation and translucency, reduced pigmentation of the retinal pigment epithelium, foveal hypoplasia, reduced visual acuity usually (20/60 to 20/400) and refractive errors, color vision impairment and prominent photophobia. Misrouting of the optic nerves is a characteristic finding, resulting in strabismus and reduced stereoscopic vision. The degree of skin and hair hypopigmentation varies with the type of OCA. The incidence of skin cancer may be increased. All four types of OCA are inherited as autosomal recessive disorders. At least four genes are responsible for the different types of the disease (TYR, OCA2, TYRP1 and MATP). Diagnosis is based on clinical findings of hypopigmentation of the skin and hair, in addition to the characteristic ocular symptoms. Due to the clinical overlap between the OCA forms, molecular diagnosis is necessary to establish the gene defect and OCA subtype. Molecular genetic testing of TYR and OCA2 is available on a clinical basis, while, at present, analysis of TYRP1 and MATP is on research basis only. Differential diagnosis includes ocular albinism, Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome, Chediak-Higashi syndrome, Griscelli syndrome, and Waardenburg syndrome type II. Carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis are possible when the disease causing mutations have been identified in the family. Glasses (possibly bifocals) and dark glasses or photocromic lenses may offer sufficient help for reduced visual activity and photophobia. Correction of strabismus and nystagmus is necessary and sunscreens are recommended. Regular skin checks for early detection of skin cancer should be offered. Persons with OCA have normal lifespan, development, intelligence and fertility."
22028225,"The prevalence of congenital myopathies in the United States has not been examined. To address this, we determined the point prevalence of congenital myopathies in a well-defined pediatric population from Southeastern Michigan. The overall point prevalence was 1:26,000. Mutations in RYR1 were the most common cause of congenital myopathies at 1:90,000. Our data broadly agrees with estimates from previous European studies and provides the first estimate of the prevalence of congenital myopathies in the United States. Ann Neurol 2011;70:662-665."
22776096,"DEFINITION OF THE DISEASE: Dominant Optic Atrophy (DOA) is a neuro-ophthalmic condition characterized by a bilateral degeneration of the optic nerves, causing insidious visual loss, typically starting during the first decade of life. The disease affects primary the retinal ganglion cells (RGC) and their axons forming the optic nerve, which transfer the visual information from the photoreceptors to the lateral geniculus in the brain.The prevalence of the disease varies from 1/10000 in Denmark due to a founder effect, to 1/30000 in the rest of the world.DOA patients usually suffer of moderate visual loss, associated with central or paracentral visual field deficits and color vision defects. The severity of the disease is highly variable, the visual acuity ranging from normal to legal blindness. The ophthalmic examination discloses on fundoscopy isolated optic disc pallor or atrophy, related to the RGC death. About 20% of DOA patients harbour extraocular multi-systemic features, including neurosensory hearing loss, or less commonly chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia, myopathy, peripheral neuropathy, multiple sclerosis-like illness, spastic paraplegia or cataracts.Two genes (OPA1, OPA3) encoding inner mitochondrial membrane proteins and three loci (OPA4, OPA5, OPA8) are currently known for DOA. Additional loci and genes (OPA2, OPA6 and OPA7) are responsible for X-linked or recessive optic atrophy. All OPA genes yet identified encode mitochondrial proteins embedded in the inner membrane and ubiquitously expressed, as are the proteins mutated in the Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy. OPA1 mutations affect mitochondrial fusion, energy metabolism, control of apoptosis, calcium clearance and maintenance of mitochondrial genome integrity. OPA3 mutations only affect the energy metabolism and the control of apoptosis.Patients are usually diagnosed during their early childhood, because of bilateral, mild, otherwise unexplained visual loss related to optic discs pallor or atrophy, and typically occurring in the context of a family history of DOA. Optical Coherence Tomography further discloses non-specific thinning of retinal nerve fiber layer, but a normal morphology of the photoreceptors layers. Abnormal visual evoked potentials and pattern ERG may also reflect the dysfunction of the RGCs and their axons. Molecular diagnosis is provided by the identification of a mutation in the OPA1 gene (75% of DOA patients) or in the OPA3 gene (1% of patients).Visual loss in DOA may progress during puberty until adulthood, with very slow subsequent chronic progression in most of the cases. On the opposite, in DOA patients with associated extra-ocular features, the visual loss may be more severe over time.To date, there is no preventative or curative treatment in DOA; severely visually impaired patients may benefit from low vision aids. Genetic counseling is commonly offered and patients are advised to avoid alcohol and tobacco consumption, as well as the use of medications that may interfere with mitochondrial metabolism. Gene and pharmacological therapies for DOA are currently under investigation."
23041378,"OBJECTIVES: Moyamoya disease (MMD) is a unique occlusive disease of the bilateral internal carotid arteries in which, compensation for occlusion results in an enrichment of collateral arteries at the base of the brain. However, the epidemiology of unilateral MMD (typical angiographic evidence of MMD unilaterally with equivocal contralateral findings), and quasi-MMD (MMD present with inherited or acquired disorders) is poorly known. Here, a nationwide epidemiological survey was conducted to estimate the total numbers of patients, the annual incidence rates and prevalences of MMD, unilateral MMD and quasi-MMD in Japan. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The neurosurgery, neurology and pediatrics departments that were listed in Japanese resident training programs were recruited to participate in this survey. Questionnaires were directly mailed to 2998 departments in February 2006. RESULTS: A total of 1183 departments replied to the questionnaire (39.5% response rate). It was estimated that there were 6670.9 MMD patients, 840.5 unilateral MMD patients and 430.4 quasi-MMD patients in Japan. The annual incidence rates of MMD, unilateral MMD and quasi-MMD are 1.13, 0.23 and 0.11/100,000, respectively, and the prevalences are 5.22, 0.66 and 0.34/100,000, respectively. These patients were mainly treated by neurosurgeons. An estimated total of 929.1 surgical interventions are performed in Japan annually. CONCLUSION: This nationwide study reports the current epidemiologic status of MMD, unilateral MMD and quasi-MMD in Japan."
27280374,"Valid data on acromegaly incidence, complications and mortality are scarce. The Danish Health Care System enables nationwide studies with complete follow-up and linkage among health-related databases to assess acromegaly incidence, prevalence, complications and mortality in a population-based cohort study.All incident cases of acromegaly in Denmark (1991-2010) were identified from health registries and validated by chart review. We estimated the annual incidence rate of acromegaly per 10(6) person-years (py) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). For every patient, 10 persons were sampled from the general population as a comparison cohort. Cox regression and hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were used.Mean age at diagnosis (48.7 years (CI: 95%: 47.2-50.1)) and annual incidence rate (3.8 cases/10(6) persons (95% CI: 3.6-4.1)) among the 405 cases remained stable. The prevalence in 2010 was 85 cases/10(6) persons. The patients were at increased risk of diabetes mellitus (HR: 4.0 (95% CI: 2.7-5.8)), heart failure (HR: 2.5 (95% CI: 1.4-4.5)), venous thromboembolism (HR: 2.3 (95% CI: 1.1-5.0)), sleep apnoea (HR: 11.7 (95% CI: 7.0-19.4)) and arthropathy (HR: 2.1 (95% CI: 1.6-2.6)). The complication risk was also increased before the diagnosis of acromegaly. Overall mortality risk was elevated (HR: 1.3 (95% CI: 1.0-1.7)) but uninfluenced by treatment modality.(i) The incidence rate and age at diagnosis of acromegaly have been stable over decades, and the prevalence is higher than previously reported. (ii) The risk of complications is very high even before the diagnosis. (iii) Mortality risk remains elevated but uninfluenced by mode of treatment."
20847697,"Classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a heritable connective tissue disorder characterized by skin hyperextensibility, fragile and soft skin, delayed wound healing with formation of atrophic scars, easy bruising, and generalized joint hypermobility. It comprises Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type I and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type II, but it is now apparent that these form a continuum of clinical findings and differ only in phenotypic severity. It is currently estimated that approximately 50% of patients with a clinical diagnosis of classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome harbor mutations in the COL5A1 and the COL5A2 gene, encoding the α1 and the α2-chain of type V collagen, respectively. However, because no prospective molecular studies of COL5A1 and COL5A2 have been performed in a clinically well-defined patient group, this number may underestimate the real proportion of patients with classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome harboring a mutation in one of these genes. In the majority of patients with molecularly characterized classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, the disease is caused by a mutation leading to a nonfunctional COL5A1 allele and resulting in haploinsufficiency of type V collagen. A smaller proportion of patients harbor a structural mutation in COL5A1 or COL5A2, causing the production of a functionally defective type V collagen protein. Most mutations identified so far result in a reduced amount of type V collagen in the connective tissues available for collagen fibrillogenesis. Inter- and intrafamilial phenotypic variability is observed, but no genotype-phenotype correlations have been observed. No treatment for the underlying defect is presently available for Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. However, a series of preventive guidelines are applicable."
22406029,"Rare thoracic cancers include those of the trachea, thymus and mesothelioma (including peritoneum mesothelioma). The aim of this study was to describe the incidence, prevalence and survival of rare thoracic tumours using a large database, which includes cancer patients diagnosed from 1978 to 2002, registered in 89 population-based cancer registries (CRs) and followed-up to 31st December 2003. Over 17,688 cases of rare thoracic cancers were selected based on the list of the RACECARE project. Mesothelioma was the most common tumour (19 per million per year) followed by epithelial tumours of the trachea and thymus (1.3 and 1.7, respectively). The age standardised incidence rates of epithelial tumours of the trachea was double in Eastern and Southern Europe versus the other European regions: 2 per million per year. Epithelial tumours of the thymus had the lowest incidence in Northern and Eastern Europe and UK and Ireland(1) and somewhat higher incidence in Central and Southern Europe.(2) Highest incidence in mesothelioma was seen in UK and Ireland(23) and lowest in Eastern Europe.(4) Patients with tumours of the thymus had the best prognosis (1-year survival 85%, 66% at 5 years). Five year survival was lowest for the mesothelioma 5% compared to 14% of patients with tumours of the trachea. Mesothelioma was the most prevalent rare cancer (12,000 cases), followed by thymus (7000) and trachea (1400). Cancer Registry (CR) data play an important role in revealing the burden of rare thoracic cancers and monitoring the effect of regulations on asbestos use and smoking related policies."
16564802,"PURPOSE: The aim of this research was to determine the molecular factors of influence on the clinical expression of Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON), which might aid in counseling LHON patients and families. The prevalence of LHON in the Dutch population was determined. DESIGN: Observational, retrospective population cohort study. METHODS: The clinical characteristics of LHON patients of 25 families, previously described in 1963, were reevaluated. The mutation and haplotype were determined in the DNA of one affected LHON patient per family. The genotype of their relatives could be deducted, enabling us to evaluate retrospectively the genotype-phenotype correlation. The prevalence of LHON was determined on the basis of anamnestic evaluation of patients in 1963 and by using population registers of that period. RESULTS: The LHON mutation does not influence disease penetrance (50% in male subjects; 10% to 20% in female subjects). More than half of the patients with the 14484 mutation exhibit a partial recovery of vision, regardless of the acuteness of disease onset (P = .001), whereas only 22% of the 11778 carriers and 15.4% of the 3460 carriers recovered. The recovery did not take place within the first year after onset and was uncommon after four years. The onset of LHON is in general very acute but might be more gradual in 11778 carriers and in children. The calculated prevalence of LHON in the Dutch population (1/39,000) is very likely an underestimation caused by a selection bias of familial cases in the original study. CONCLUSIONS: The LHON genotype influences the recovery of vision and disease onset but is unrelated to age, acuteness of onset, or gender. The genotype does not influence disease penetrance. Children might exhibit a slower onset of disease."
17074786,"To determine the incidence of severe hyperbilirubinaemia in the newborn, and to identify associated clinical and demographic variables, and short-term outcomes.Prospective, population-based study.UK and Republic of Ireland, between 1 May 2003 and 31 May 2005.Infants in the first month of life with severe hyperbilirubinaemia (maximum unconjugated serum bilirubin >/=510 micromol/l).108 infants met the case definition, 106 from the UK and 2 from the Republic of Ireland. The UK incidence of severe hyperbilirubinaemia was 7.1/100 000 live births (95% CI 5.8 to 8.6). Only 20 cases presented in hospital; 88 were admitted with severe jaundice. 64 (60.4%) cases were male, and 56 (51.8%) were of ethnic minority origin. 87 (80.5%) cases were exclusively breast fed. Co-morbidity included haemolysis, dehydration, infection and bruising. 14 infants showed evidence of bilirubin encephalopathy, of whom 3 died. The UK incidence of bilirubin encephalopathy was 0.9/100 000 live births (95% CI 0.46 to 1.5).This is the first large, prospective, population-based study of the incidence of severe hyperbilirubinaemia in the newborn. The clinical and demographic associations, and short-term outcomes identified, are the same as those reported recently in North America and Europe."
20657024,"BACKGROUND:Over the last 15 years, bacterial meningitis has received considerable attention, including national guidelines, whilst viral central nervous system (CNS) infections have been relatively neglected. A recent pilot study suggested that management of patients with suspected viral encephalitis was often suboptimal. AIM:To examine the relative incidence, clinical features and management of suspected acute CNS infections in adults across the NHS North West Region. DESIGN:A multicentre cross-sectional retrospective cohort study at 10 hospitals across the region over 3 months (from September to December 2007). Following a screen of all patients who had cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis or received intravenous aciclovir and/or third-generation cephalosporin, those with clinical features suspicious of a CNS infection were included. Management was compared with the national meningitis and regional encephalitis guidelines. RESULTS:Three hundred and eighty-five patients were screened; 217 patients had a suspected CNS infection and 44 (20%) had a CNS infection: 18 aseptic meningitis (one herpes simplex virus [HSV]-2), 13 purulent meningitis (four Streptococcus pneumoniae) and 13 encephalitis (three HSV-1). The median (range) time from admission to suspicion of CNS infection and to LP was longer for patients with encephalitis than meningitis [4 (0.3-312) vs. 0.3 (0.1-12) h, P<0.001, and 23 (4-360) vs. 12 (2-48) h, P=0.042, respectively]; and the median time to treatment was longer for aciclovir than cephalosporin [7 (0.5-312) vs. 3 (0.3-312) h, P=0.002]. DISCUSSION:Encephalitis was as common as purulent meningitis, and HSV as common as Streptococcus pneumoniae. However, the management of patients with encephalitis was worse than meningitis. National encephalitis guidelines are needed."
9254847,"The comparison of regional patterns of recessive disease mutations is a new source of information for studies of population genetics. The analysis of phenylketonuria (PKU) mutations in Northern Ireland shows that most major episodes of immigration have left a record in the modern genepool. The mutation 165T can be traced to the Palaeolithic people of western Europe who, in the Mesolithic period, first colonised Ireland. R408W (on haplotype 1) in contrast, the most common Irish PKU mutation, may have been prevalent in the Neolithic farmers who settled in Ireland after 4500 BC. No mutation was identified that could represent European Celtic populations, supporting the view that the adoption of Celtic culture and language in Ireland did not involve major migration from the continent. Several less common mutations can be traced to the Norwegian Atlantic coast and were probably introduced into Ireland by Vikings. This indicates that PKU has not been brought to Norway from the British Isles, as was previously argued. The rarity in Northern Ireland of IVS12nt1, the most common mutation in Denmark and England, indicates that the English colonialization of Ireland did not alter the local genepool in a direction that could be described as Anglo-Saxon. Our results show that the culture and language of a population can be independent of its genetic heritage, and give some insight into the history of the peoples of Northern Ireland."
19549223,"Australia-wide population-based surveillance for scedosporiosis identified 180 cases, with 118 (65.6%) cases of colonization and 62 (34.4%) cases of infection. Predisposing factors for isolation of Scedosporium spp. included chronic lung disease in 37.8% and malignancy in 21.7% of cases. Predictors of invasive disease (n=62) included haematological stem cell transplantation (n=7), leukaemia (n=16) and diabetes mellitus (n=8). Of 183 phenotypically-speciated isolates, 75 (41%) were Scedosporium prolificans (risk factors: haematologic cancer (n=17), neutropaenia (n=14)) and 108 (59%) had Scedosporium apiospermum/Pseudallescheria boydii phenotype [risk factor: diabetes (n=15)].

Epidemiological and antifungal susceptibility profiles of Scedosporium aurantiacum (prevalence>or=15.8%) and S. apiospermum were similar. No patient with S. aurantiacum infection (n=6) died. This is the first description of clinical features associated with S. aurantiacum."
28687376,"BACKGROUND:Rare cancers pose challenges for diagnosis, treatments, and clinical decision making. Information about rare cancers is scant. The RARECARE project defined rare cancers as those with an annual incidence of less than six per 100 000 people in European Union (EU). We updated the estimates of the burden of rare cancers in Europe, their time trends in incidence and survival, and provide information about centralisation of treatments in seven European countries. METHODS:We analysed data from 94 cancer registries for more than 2 million rare cancer diagnoses, to estimate European incidence and survival in 2000-07 and the corresponding time trends during 1995-2007. Incidence was calculated as the number of new cases divided by the corresponding total person-years in the population. 5-year relative survival was calculated by the Ederer-2 method. Seven registries (Belgium, Bulgaria, Finland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Slovenia, and the Navarra region in Spain) provided additional data for hospitals treating about 220 000 cases diagnosed in 2000-07. We also calculated hospital volume admission as the number of treatments provided by each hospital rare cancer group sharing the same referral pattern. FINDINGS:Rare cancers accounted for 24% of all cancers diagnosed in the EU during 2000-07. The overall incidence rose annually by 0.5% (99·8% CI 0·3-0·8). 5-year relative survival for all rare cancers was 48·5% (95% CI 48·4 to 48·6), compared with 63·4% (95% CI 63·3 to 63·4) for all common cancers. 5-year relative survival increased (overall 2·9%, 95% CI 2·7 to 3·2), from 1999-2001 to 2007-09, and for most rare cancers, with the largest increases for haematological tumours and sarcomas. The amount of centralisation of rare cancer treatment varied widely between cancers and between countries. The Netherlands and Slovenia had the highest treatment volumes. INTERPRETATION:Our study benefits from the largest pool of population-based registries to estimate incidence and survival of about 200 rare cancers. Incidence trends can be explained by changes in known risk factors, improved diagnosis, and registration problems. Survival could be improved by early diagnosis, new treatments, and improved case management. The centralisation of treatment could be improved in the seven European countries we studied.

10642674,"BACKGROUND: Hydroa vacciniforme (HV) is a rare, sporadic, idiopathic photodermatosis characterized by vesicles and crust formation after sunlight exposure. The lesions typically heal with vacciniform scarring. OBJECTIVE: We identify and review the clinical features and follow-up data of Scottish patients with HV and report on the prevalence of this condition. This is the largest recent study of HV patients from a single center. METHODS: In this retrospective study, patients with HV were identified by means of the diagnostic database from the Photobiology Unit, Dundee. Patients were contacted and details of clinical features, duration of disease, results of investigations, and treatment were recorded. At review, disease progress was assessed. RESULTS: Between 1973 and 1997, 17 patients (9 males and 8 females) with a diagnosis of HV were investigated. Data from 15 patients showed a mean age at onset of 7.9 years (range, 1 to 16 years), with females (mean, 6.7 years; range, 2 to 12 years) having an earlier onset than males (mean, 8.7 years; range, 1 to 16 years). A bimodal age distribution was also identified with onsets between the ages of 1 and 7 years and 12 and 16 years. At review, spontaneous clearing had occurred in 9 patients (60%) with mean duration of disease being 9 years (range, 4 to 17 years). Males had longer disease duration (mean, 11 years; range, 5 to 17 years) than females (mean, 5 years; range, 4 to 7 years). Eight patients (53%) were sensitive in the UVA wave-band on monochromator phototesting, and 6 (40%) experienced papulovesicular lesions on repetitive broad-spectrum UVA irradiation. All patients received broad-spectrum sunscreens with variable results. Of the 5 patients treated with narrow-band UVB (TL-01) phototherapy, 3 reported beneficial results with an increase in tolerance to sunlight exposure and associated reduction in disease severity. CONCLUSION: The estimated prevalence of HV was at least 0.34 cases per 100,000 with an approximately equal sex ratio. Males had a later onset and longer duration of disease than females. Phototesting showed abnormal responses in the UVA wavebands in 53% of cases, whereas 60% of patients treated with prophylactic TL-01 phototherapy found it beneficial."
27966541,"Von Hippel-Lindau disease (vHL) is a rare hereditary tumour predisposition with multiorgan involvement that is not always easily recognized. The disease is reported to be almost fully penetrant at age 60 years. Previous estimates of vHL prevalence and incidence are all regional and vary widely. Most are >20 years old and prone to selection bias because of inclusion of only clinically affected vHL patients who were diagnosed before genetic testing was available. In an unselected cohort of all known Danish carriers of a disease-causing VHL variant, we assessed vHL penetrance on a national basis. We further used national health registers to identify individuals who fulfilled the clinical diagnostic vHL criteria based on their registered diagnostic codes, but had not been diagnosed with vHL. We also assessed the medical histories of first-degree relatives to identify familial cases. This study gives the first national estimates of vHL prevalence (1 in 46 900 individuals) and birth incidence (1 in 27 300 live births). vHL has been underdiagnosed in Denmark, and as many as 25% of the overall vHL cohort (diagnosed+undiagnosed patients) have a missed diagnosis in spite of fulfilling the international diagnostic criteria. We found an overall penetrance of 87% at age 60 years. When considering only vHL patients who have not attended surveillance, 20% will still be asymptomatic at age 60 years. This should be considered in the context of genetic counselling, especially when assessing the risk of vHL in asymptomatic adult first-degree relatives who are often not genetically tested."
18855308,"BACKGROUND: alpha-1-Antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a rare condition with a prevalence of about 1/4000 individuals in Germany. The clinical manifestations are the early development of pulmonary emphysema or of liver cirrhosis. The low prevalence of AATD suggested the establishment of a registry with the aim to learn more details about the natural history and the quality of care for these patients. METHODS, PATIENTS, RESULTS: Since 2004 the German registry for individuals with AATD is maintained in Marburg. Up to May 2008, 548 individuals were registered, 455 with the genotype PiZZ and 46 with PiSZ. The age range of the registered individuals extends from 2 to 82 years (mean 55, SD 20; men 54 [SD 19] years, women 55 [SD 21] years). Most patients are affected by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, distribution to the GOLD stages: GOLD I = 16 %, GOLD II = 30 %, GOLD III = 33 %, GOLD IV = 21 %). Currently 109 subjects are under substitution therapy. The time period between the first symptom and the establishment of the correct diagnosis was on average 5.6 years. CONCLUSIONS: The data of the registry allow a detailed characterisation of the natural course of the disease and the levels of the patient care."
18174559,"Rett syndrome is an X-linked dominant neurodevelopmental disorder. Mutation of the methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 gene (MECP2) is present in up to 96% of patients with Rett syndrome. Eight mutations represent the hotspot of MECP2 mutations (R106W, R133C, T158M, R168X, R255X, R270X, R294X, and R306C) in patients with classic Rett syndrome. The prevalence and survival rate of Rett syndrome among Chinese women was investigated. The 8 hotspot mutations and the A140V mutation were also studied in 4 cohorts of Chinese children (n = 144) actively followed up in our university neurodevelopmental center with classic Rett syndrome (n = 5), autism spectrum disorder (n = 94), epileptic encephalopathy of unknown cause (n = 22), and nonsyndromal mental retardation (n = 23). The prevalence of Rett syndrome among female Chinese younger than 35 years in Hong Kong West is 0.57 (95% confidence interval, 0.15-0.98) per 10 000. Survival is 100.0% at 10 years and 87.5% at 25 years. Three hotspot mutations (R106W, R255X, and R306C) were found in 3 girls with classic Rett syndrome. No hotspot MECP2 mutations were found in the other 3 cohorts. Screening of MECP2 mutations is not worthwhile in Chinese children with pure cognitive, autistic, or unexplained epileptic disorders without other signs of Rett syndrome. In the early stage of developmental arrest before developmental regression, MECP2 screening might be useful for girls with unexplained epileptic encephalopathy before full-blown classic Rett syndrome is evident."
21999890,"Although the subspeciality of movement disorders was established in neurology more than 20 years ago, it is relatively new in Thailand, and while most physicians are generally aware of Parkinson's disease, they often are not familiar with dystonia. As one of the common movement disorders seen in general practice, a number of family and population studies have suggested that as many as two-thirds of patients with dystonia may be underdiagnosed and it is likely that misdiagnosis occurs frequently. Moreover, there is little information on the prevalence of dystonia in Thailand. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence and clinical profile of dystonia among Thai patients who came from the southern part of Bangkok, which is in the catchment area of Chulalongkorn University Hospital. In addition, the diagnostic accuracy of dystonia among referred patients was assessed. The medical records of 207 patients were reviewed and it was determined that a large proportion of them (71.9%) had focal dystonia with cervical dystonia being the most common form. Primary dystonia (68.1%) accounted for the majority of the cases. The prevalence of all forms of dystonia, primary dystonia and focal dystonia was 19.9, 13.6 and 14.3 per 100,000 persons, respectively. The diagnostic accuracy of dystonia among referred patients was 85.5%. The most common misdiagnosis was cervical spondylosis, followed by myofascial pain syndrome. Most patients had an average disease duration of 4 years before dystonia was finally diagnosed. Most patients with focal dystonia responded well to botulinum toxin therapy, with 13.3% suffering only mild transient adverse events. In spite of the limitations of this study, this data will initiate a process of increasing both patient and professional awareness of dystonia in Thailand."
11562417,"Cystinosis is an autosomal recessive disorder, characterized by an accumulation of intralysosomal cystine, with an incidence of 1 in 100,000 to 200,000 live births. A higher incidence of cystinosis, 1 in 26,000 live births, has been reported in the western French province of Brittany. PCR amplification and sequencing has identified a 27-bp deletion starting 3 bp before the end of exon 8 and continuing into intron 8, 898-900+24del27, which has only been detected in families from this region. Reverse transcription-PCR amplification of RNA from an affected individual has shown that this mutation is indeed a splice-site mutation and results in the production of aberrant transcripts. These transcripts are predicted to either severely truncate cystinosin or alter its topology, thus accounting for the severe phenotype of these individuals. The mutation 898-900+24del27 has been identified in 7 of 18 alleles studied. This mutation is likely to be a founder mutation and would account for the higher incidence of cystinosis in Brittany.(1)"
25822844,"The present and future live birth prevalence of Down syndrome (DS) is of practical importance for planning services and prioritizing research to support people living with the condition. Live birth prevalence is influenced by changes in prenatal screening technologies and policies. To predict the future impact of these changes, a model for estimating the live births of people with DS is required. In this study, we combine diverse and robust datasets with validated estimation techniques to describe the non-selective and live birth prevalence of DS in the United States from 1900-2010. Additionally, for the period 1974-2010, we estimate the impact of DS-related elective pregnancy terminations (following a prenatal diagnosis of DS) on the live births with DS. The live birth prevalence for DS in the most recent years (2006-2010) was estimated at 12.6 per 10,000 (95% CI 12.4-12.8), with around 5,300 births annually. During this period, an estimated 3,100 DS-related elective pregnancy terminations were performed in the U.S. annually. As of 2007, the estimated rates at which live births with DS were reduced as a consequence of DS-related elective pregnancy terminations were 30% (95% CI: 27.3-31.9) for the U.S. as a whole. Our results and our model provide data on the impact of elective pregnancy terminations on live births with DS and may provide a baseline from which future trends for live births with DS can be estimated."
22227039,"To the central nervous system (CNS) belong a heterogeneous group of glial and non glial rare cancers. The aim of the present study was to estimate the burden (incidence, prevalence, survival and proportion of cured) for the principal CNS cancers in Europe (EU27) and in European regions using population-based data from cancer registries participating in the RARECARE project. We analysed 44,947 rare CNS cancers diagnosed from 1995 to 2002 (with follow up at 31st December 2003): 86.0% astrocytic (24% low grade, 63% high grade and 13% glioma NOS), 6.4% oligodendroglial (74% low grade), 3.6% ependymal (85% low grade), 4.1% Embryonal tumours and 0.1% choroid plexus carcinoma. Incidence rates vary widely across European regions especially for astrocytic tumours ranging from 3/100,000 in Eastern Europe to 5/100,000 in United Kingdom and Ireland. Overall, about 27,700 new rare CNS cancers were estimated every year in EU27, for an annual incidence rate of 4.8 per 100,000 for astrocytic, 0.4 for oligodendroglial, 0.2 for ependymal and embryonal tumours and less than 0.1 for choroid plexus carcinoma. More than 154,000 persons with rare CNS were estimated alive (prevalent cases) in the EU at the beginning of 2008. Five-year relative survival was 14.5% for astrocytic tumours (42.6% for low grade, 4.9% for high grade and 17.5% for glioma NOS), 54.5% for oligodendroglial (64.9% high grade and 29.6% low grade), 74.2% for ependymal (80.4% low grade and 36.6% high grade), 62.8% for choroid plexus carcinomas and 56.8% for embryonal tumours. Survival rates for astrocytic tumours were relatively higher in Northern and Central Europe than in Eastern Europe and in UK and Ireland. The different availability of diagnostic imaging techniques and/or radiation therapy equipment across Europe may contribute to explain the reported survival differences. The estimated proportion of cured patients was 7.9% for the 'glial' group to which belong astrocytic tumours. Overall results are strongly influenced by astrocytic tumours that are the most common type. This is the first study to delineate the rare CNS cancer burden in Europe by age, sex and European region."
23129486,"The purpose of this study was to investigate recent epidemiological trends of myasthenia gravis (MG) in Austria.We used the national hospital discharge register, which records the discharge diagnoses of all inpatient stays in Austria to calculate the yearly inpatient prevalence of MG from 1992 to 2009 (main or secondary diagnosis of MG). The population prevalence was indirectly estimated. The temporal and geographical variability of the inpatient prevalence was correlated with the number of practicing neurologists.The inpatient prevalence of 2009 was calculated as 8.0 and the population prevalence as 15.69 (95 % CI 13.16-19.42) per 100,000. We observed a 2.2 fold increase in the inpatient prevalence between 1992 and 2009, which was mainly due to a rise in the number of older patients (³ 50 years). Partly this could be accounted for by an ageing of the population as a whole and a rise in the age of hospitalised patients. However, after adjusting for demographic factors an unexplained average yearly rise of 3.7-3.9 % remained. We found a significant spatial and temporal correlation of MG inpatient prevalence rates with the number of practicing neurologists, which increased over the same period.The results from this study support the notion that the prevalence rate of MG in Austria is rising and near the higher end of the wide range discussed in the literature. Our data argue for the importance of specialist neurological care for the diagnosis of this disease."
19036343,"BACKGROUND: 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA lyase deficiency (HL deficiency) is a rare autosomal recessive mitochondrial disease characterized by a deficiency in the enzyme 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA lyase (HMGCL). Here, we report on novel mutations identified in the HMGCL gene in 2 Taiwanese patients with HL deficiency. METHODS: Analysis of organic acids in urine was performed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to confirm HL deficiency in the two subjects. The mutations in their HMGCL genes then were determined by direct sequencing. In addition, the effect of a splice site mutation was determined using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR). RESULTS: A total of 3 novel mutations in the HMGCL gene were revealed by molecular analysis: one missense mutation (c.494G>T, p.Arg165Gln) and 2 splice site mutations (IVS3+1G>A, IVS6-1G>A). The results of RT-PCR revealed that an IVS3+1G>A mutation leads to skipping of exon3. We also calculated that the incidence of HL deficiency in Taiwan is <1 per 1,000,000 live births. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that unique HMGCL gene mutations exist in Taiwanese HL deficiency patients. Therefore, HMGCL gene profiling may be useful in genetic counseling for families affected by HL deficiency."
23555592,"BACKGROUND: Facial cleft deformities, including cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL/P) and cleft palate (CP), are common congenital birth anomalies, especially in Asia. This study aimed to analyze the prevalence of CL/P and CP and to identify associated factors in Taiwan. METHODS: This population-based epidemiological study retrospectively analyzed birth data obtained from the Department of Health in Taiwan for years 2002-2009. Frequency distribution, percentages and related predictors were investigated, and findings were presented by types of cleft deformities. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with cleft deformities. RESULTS: Overall prevalence of cleft deformities among 1,705,192 births was 0.1% for CL/P and 0.04% for CP over the 8-year study period. Higher prevalence of CL/P or CP was observed with multiple pregnancies, being male for CL/P, being female for CP, gestational age ≤37 weeks and lower birth weight (<1.5 kg). Both CL/P and CP were significantly associated with gestational age <37 weeks and birth weight<1.5 kg (all P <0.0001). CL/P was significantly associated with multiple parities (P = 0.0004-0.002). Male newborns and female newborns were significantly associated with CL/P and CP, respectively (both P<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Overall prevalence for congenital cleft deformities in study subjects was 0.1%, in keeping with high rates in Asia. Results suggest the need for awareness and early identification of those at high risk for cleft deformities, including newborns with gestational age <37 weeks, weighing <1.5 kg at birth and women with multiple parities, as a potential strategy to counter long-term adverse effects on speech and language in this population."
15559155,A spectrum of hereditary diseases of the nervous system (HDNS) was studied in the cities of Volgograd and Volzhsky. The estimates were obtained for the prevalence of major HDNS groups and individual nosological forms. The populations examined differed in prevalence of this pathology and in contribution of individual diseases and their nosological forms into HDNS load formation. The effect of the population dynamics in Volgograd and Volzhsky on the HDNS prevalence is discussed.
30396519,"Gastroparesis is a complex syndrome with symptoms that include nausea, vomiting, and postprandial abdominal pain, and is frequently accompanied by significant delays in gastric emptying. The pathophysiology of diabetic gastroparesis is fairly well understood; however, idiopathic gastroparesis, which accounts for one-third of all cases, may stem from infections, or autoimmune or neurologic disorders, among other causes. To date, few population-based studies have estimated the true prevalence and incidence of gastroparesis. Nonetheless, its prevalence appears to be rising, as does its incidence among minority populations, documented via hospitalizations, which can impose significant economic burdens on patients."
25274184,"AIM: There are more than 50 inherited lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs), and this study examined the incidence of clinically diagnosed LSDs in Sweden. METHODS: The number of patients diagnosed during 1980-2009 was compiled from the registries of the two Swedish diagnostic laboratories that cover the whole country. RESULTS: We identified 433 patients during the 30-year period, with a total incidence of one in every 6100 births and identified fairly constant annual diagnoses during the last 20 years. Krabbe disease was the most common (one in 39 000) followed by Gaucher disease (one in 47 000), metachromatic leukodystrophy and Salla disease. Gaucher disease was more frequent in Sweden than other European countries, due to a founder effect of the mutation (p.L444P) in northern Sweden. Metachromatic leukodystrophy was one of the most common LSDs, in common with other countries. Salla disease, which is very rare elsewhere, was the fourth most common, stemming from a founder mutation in the Salla region of northern Finland brought to Sweden by immigration. CONCLUSION: The collective incidence of LSDs in Sweden was essentially equal to other European countries, but with a somewhat different disease pattern. Our findings have implications for diagnostic algorithms and treatment strategies."
6240474,"All newly diagnosed cases of Hirschsprung's Disease among children born in Baltimore City and County, Maryland and diagnosed within the Baltimore Standard Metropolitan Area during 1969 through 1977 were identified. Using hospital records and death certificates, 33 cases were ascertained. An overall incidence rate of 18.6 per 100 000 livebirths was found, similar to that reported by others. A high male to female ratio (4.32:1) was found; the ratio for non-whites to whites was 1.67:1. Non-white males had the highest rate, 37.6 per 100 000 livebirths. These findings plus the fact that 9% of these children were also diagnosed as having Down's Syndrome, were evidence that the aetiology of Hirschsprung's Disease may be partially genetic. Among environmental factors studied, there was no time trend and no relationship with socioeconomic status found. Among whites, there was a larger percentage of children who were the first births of mothers aged 30 and above, a result previously reported for children with neural tube defects. Very little is known about micro-environmental factors in relation to Hirschsprung's Disease and this would seem to be the area for future emphasis in research."
9409876,"Holoprosencephaly is a congenital defect of the median structures of the brain and face. The epidemiology is poorly known due to the paucity of population-based studies. This study describes the epidemiology of holoprosencephaly in a large population, using cases identified through the New York State Congenital Malformations Registry, and born in 1984-1989. We describe the craniofacial abnormalities present, their frequency, and their cooccurrence, and we examine the correspondence between the severity of craniofacial abnormalities, chromosomal abnormalities, and severity of the brain defect. Liveborn cases totaled 78, yielding a prevalence of 4.8 per 100,000 live births. Prevalence among girls was nearly double that in boys, and was 4.2 times higher among infants of mothers under age 18 compared to infants of older mothers. Only 9.8% of all cases had no craniofacial abnormalities other than the brain defect. Eye malformations were present in 76.8%, nose malformations in 69.5%, ear malformations in 50%, and oral clefts in 41.5%. These malformations arise at different times during gestation. The variability in patterns of cooccurrence suggests variability in the developmental pathways and/or timing of developmental derangements which result in holoprosencephaly. This, in turn, is consistent with a model of multiple causes. Children with alobar holoprosencephaly tended to have the most severe craniofacial anomalies, but the correspondence was not 100%. Craniofacial phenotype does not consistently discriminate between cytogenetically normal and abnormal cases."
20824457,"Registry and epidemiological data of Rare Anaemias (RA) in Europe is in general still incomplete and/or partially documented. One important issue is the increasing prevalence of haemoglobin disorders (HD) due to migrations from high prevalence areas. The size of the problem, particularly for sickle cell disease (SCD), is already having an impact on health services in many European countries. The best known cause of rare anaemias associated with congenital haemolytic anaemia (CHA) in Europe is Hereditary Spherocytosis (HS) a red blood cell (RBC) membrane defect with a prevalence of 1 to 5 cases per 10.000 individuals. Some other causes of CHA are extremely rare and only few individual cases have been described worldwide (i.e. some RBC enzymopathies). Congenital defects of erythropoiesis are less frequent Diamond-Blackfan Anaemia (DBA) and Fanconi Anaemia (FA) exhibit a very low prevalence ranging from 4 to 7 per million live births. Congenital Dyserythropoietic Anaemia (CDA), a genetically heterogenous group, is still less frequent and exhibits a large variability of frequency depending on the European region: 0.1-3.0 cases per million births In addition many cases are known from a large autosomal dominant family in Sweden. Although incidence of Paroxysmal Nocturnal Haemoglobinuria (PNH) in Europe is still unknown, data collection from different sources has given quotes of 1 case per 100,000 individuals to 5 cases per million births."
8845721,A comprehensive study of inherited neuromuscular disease was carried out in Northern Ireland between 1 February 1993 and 30 June 1994. Cases were ascertained from eight different sources and investigations and diagnoses were reviewed. Five hundred and forty three individuals were identified giving an overall prevalence of inherited neuromuscular disease of 1 in 2900 of the population. The prevalence of myotonic dystrophy was higher than that in most previously reported studies and accounted for 25% of all cases. Congenital myopathies were also found more frequently than expected. The overall prevalence compares well with that estimated by Emery from the reported prevalence rates of individual diseases.
24260271,"BACKGROUND: Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS) is characterized by intestinal polyposis, mucocutaneous pigmentation and an increased cancer risk, usually caused by mutations of the STK11 gene. This study collected epidemiological, clinical and genetic data from all Uruguayan PJS patients. METHODS: Clinical data were obtained from public and private medical centers and updated annually. Sequencing of the STK11 gene in one member of each family was performed. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: 25 cases in 11 unrelated families were registered (15 males, 10 females). The average age of diagnosis and death was 18 and 41 years respectively. All patients had characteristic PJS pigmentation and gastrointestinal polyps. 72% required urgent surgery due to intestinal obstruction. 3 families had multiple cases of seizure disorder, representing 20% of cases. 28% developed cancer and two patients had more than one cancer. An STK11 mutation was found in 8 of the 9 families analyzed. A unique M136K missense mutation was noted in one family. Comparing annual live births and PJS birth records from 1970 to 2009 yielded an incidence of 1 in 155,000. CONCLUSION: The Uruguayan Registry for Peutz-Jeghers patients showed a high chance of emergent surgery, epilepsy, cancer and shortened life expectancy. The M136K missense mutation is a newly reported STK 11 mutation."
10589544,"A prevalence study of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) was performed in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, with a prevalence day of August 6, 1996, which coincided with a national census. The population of NSW was 5,995,544, and the crude prevalence of CIDP was 1.9 per 100,000 population. It was higher in male patients than in female patients, and the age-specific prevalence reached a maximum of 6.7 per 100,000 population in the 70- to 79-year-old age group. The prevalence in the city of Newcastle, with a population of 448,663, was 2.0 per 100,000 population and is representative of the whole of NSW. The estimated crude annual incidence was 0.15 per 100,000 population. The mean age of onset was 47.6 years (median, 53.5 years), 51% of patients had a relapsing-remitting course, the mean duration on prevalence day was 7.1 years (median, 5 years), and 87% of patients were able to walk without walking aids or other assistance."
20163033,"There is little information on the incidence of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) because on many occasions the disease can progress asymptomatically, different diagnostic criteria have been proposed during the last 20 years, and many epidemiological studies are based on retrospective clinical series. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of AIH in the province of Valencia, Spain, during the year 2003.The Services of Gastroenterology of eight acute-care reference hospitals in the province of Valencia, Spain, covering 1,774,736 inhabitants over 14 years of age, participated in a prospective study. All newly diagnosed patients with AIH between January 1, 2003 and December 31, 2003 were eligible. The diagnosis was based on criteria of the International Autoimmune Hepatitis Group revised in 1999.There were 19 new cases of AIH, 18 females and 1 male [mean (SD) age of 54.3 (11.2) years, range 23-73]. Incidence peaked in the 45-54 year age group. Eighteen cases were classified as AIH type 1 and one case as AIH type 2. The incidence rate of AIH for the year 2003 in people older than 14 years of age was 1.07 new cases per 100,000 inhabitants, with 1.96 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in females and 0.12 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in males.The 2003 annual incidence of AIH in Valencia, Spain, was similar to that reported in other European countries. AIH occurred more frequently in women and in the 45-54 year age group, type 1 being the most common."
24289197,"We conducted a cross-sectional nationwide survey to determine eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg-Strauss) (EGPA) prevalence and clinical features in Japan.Data for EGPA patients in 2008 were collected from 1,564 hospitals. In total, 965 patients were reported from 365 departments. In a second survey, clinical data for 473 patients were obtained.We estimated that 1,866 (95% CI: 1,640-2,092) patients have EGPA in Japan (prevalence, 17.8/1,000,000). Of the 473 patients in the second survey, 315 fulfilled American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria or Lanham's criteria for EGPA. The mean age (± SD) of the 315 at onset was 55 ± 14 years, male to female ratio 1:2. 93% of patients had neurological manifestations, which were the organ system most frequently involved. Among 277 patients tested for myeloperoxidase (MPO)-/p anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA), 139 (50%) were positive, while only 6 of 238 were positive for proteinase3 (PR3)-/cANCA. MPO-ANCA-positive patients had renal involvement, mucous membrane or ophthalmological symptoms, and ENT symptoms more frequently, whereas cutaneous lesions and cardiovascular involvement were less common.The prevalence of EGPA and the frequency of MPO-/p-ANCA-positivity in Japanese EGPA patients were mostly similar to those of Western countries. However, female predominance and a high frequency of neurological manifestations characterized Japanese patients."
11400783,"The newborn screening program in Latvia was started in 1980 as pilot study project. Mass screening for phenylketonuria (PKU) in the whole republic was started in 1987, but for congenital hypothyroidism (CH) it begun in 1996. Last two years the Latvian State Medical Genetics Center (SMGC) screened nearly 25,000 newborn dried blood specimens per year. Approximately 25% are repeat and control specimens. Efficiency of the screening program is nearly 97%. Fluorometric method is used for PKU screening, followed by amino acid analysis (HPLC) and analysis of DNA samples for mutations of the PAH gene. Most of the 51 Latvian PKU patients detected from 1980 to 1998 were selected by neonatal screening (38), while the others (13) were diagnosed during genetic counseling. The incidence of PKU in Latvia is 1:8,700 births. CH screening is based on measurement of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), using fluoroimmunoassay method, with cut-off value 10 mlU/l, as the primary screening test, and T3 and T4, as confirmatory tests for diagnosis. From 38,684 newborns 37,380 were screened for CH in 1996 and 1997. From these 1,438 (3.8%) newborns were recalled because of initial elevation of TSH level. From these 85 (0.2%) newborns had elevated TSH level during first two weeks of life and were referred to SMGC for repeat testing and follow-up. The diagnosis of CH has been confirmed in 6 babies. The incidence of CH in Latvia is about 1:6,450."
25132663,"To establish the incidence of giant cell arteritis (GCA), cumulative use of prednisolone, and comorbidities most associated with GCA.The data source was the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink. Selection criteria included ≥1 record of a diagnostic term for GCA between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2011, age ≥50 years, and ≥1 prescription of oral or systemic corticosteroid. Controls were selected randomly (2:1), with year of birth, practice, and followup duration (<2 or ≥2 years) as matching variables. Analysis was data driven; all comorbidities were identified in a 2-year window, with relative risk (RR) calculated and rank ordered.A total of 4,671 patients fulfilled the definition of GCA (incidence, 1.0 per 10,000 person-years), with highest incidence (7.4 per 10,000 person-years) in women ages 70-79 years. Of the 4,671 patients, 4,655 (99.7%) were prescribed prednisolone. In the group with ≥2 years' followup (n = 3,074), the mean number of prednisolone prescriptions was 32.1, and the mean cumulative dose was 8,640 mg; 1,034 patients (33.4%) received a cumulative dose of ≥10,000 mg. Comorbidities strongly associated with GCA were polymyalgia rheumatica (RR 14.9, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 11.9-18.7), visual disturbances (RR 4.6, 95% CI 2.7-7.8), facial pain (RR 3.3, 95% CI 2.1-5.3), osteoporosis (RR 2.9, 95% 2.3-3.7), hypokalemia (RR 2.5, 95% CI 1.6-3.9), and various infections such as oral/esophageal thrush (RR 3.7, 95% CI 2.2-6.0) and herpes zoster (RR 2.6, 95% CI 1.6-4.1).GCA is relatively uncommon; its incidence peaks at age 70-79 years in women. Overall, GCA patients in the UK are treated with high cumulative prednisolone doses. Many conditions are associated with GCA, including several related to corticosteroid use."
16368729,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of Wegener's granulomatosis (WG) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) in the province of Canterbury, New Zealand. METHOD: Three hospital clinical databases and the immunology laboratory database were searched and case notes reviewed for patients fulfilling either the 1990 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for WG or a modification of those criteria that allowed for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) positivity in the absence of granulomatous vasculitis. MPA was defined by the Chapel Hill consensus definition; however, in the absence of histological evidence of pauci-immune glomerulonephritis, ANCA positivity in association with evidence of active glomerular disease was included as a criterion. The point prevalence at 31 December 2003 and the 5-yr period prevalence for the interval 1 January 1999 to 31 December 2003 were calculated. RESULTS: Seventy-three patients with WG and 28 patients with MPA fulfilled the inclusion criteria. A 5-yr period prevalence of 152 WG cases/million [95% confidence interval (CI) 117-186] and 58 MPA cases/million (95% CI 37-80) was calculated using 2001 census data as denominator. Nineteen patients with WG died and 10 patients with MPA died during the study period, resulting in a point prevalence for survivors at 31 December 2003 of 112 cases/million (95% CI 82-142) and 37 cases/million (95% CI 20-55), respectively. Using unmodified ACR criteria the 5-yr period and point prevalence for WG were 131/million (95% CI 99-163) and 93.5/million (95% CI 66-121), respectively. Apart from respiratory tract involvement, which formed part of the case definition of WG, organ involvement was similar in both diseases. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of WG and MPA in Canterbury is the highest reported to date. Restricting the case definition of WG to the ACR classification criteria we found a prevalence equivalent to that described in northern Norway. The clinical severity and serological characteristics were similar to descriptions in other WG and MPA patient cohorts. Studies of disease prevalence in other Southern Hemisphere centres will determine if the observed north-south negative disease gradient in the Northern Hemisphere is reciprocated."
11136884,"OBJECTIVE:To investigate the period prevalences of primary systemic vasculitides (PSV) in urban and rural populations in northern and southern Germany in 1994. METHODS:Questionnaires were sent to all hospital departments, all physicians, health insurance providers and pension funds, reference laboratories for autoimmune diseases, and death registries in two catchment areas in northern and southern Germany (combined population 875 983) to identify patients with PSV between 1 January and 31 December 1994. Each catchment area encompassed both an urban and a rural area. Each case was re-evaluated by the authors by applying the definitions of the 1992 Chapel Hill Consensus Conference on the Nomenclature of Systemic Vasculitis. RESULTS:A total of 180 PSV patients were identified. The overall prevalence of PSV was 216 cases per 1 000 000 inhabitants (95% confidence interval (CI) 173-259) in northern Germany vs 195 (95% CI 153-236) in southern Germany. The prevalence of PSV was two-fold higher in women than in men, and five-fold higher in people aged > or =50 yr than in people aged <50 yr. The most frequent type of PSV was giant cell arteritis (GCA), with 87 cases per 1 000 000 in northern and 94 in southern Germany, followed by Wegener's granulomatosis, with 58 and 42 cases respectively. In the population aged > or =50 yr the prevalence of GCA was 240 per 1 000 000 in northern and 300 in southern Germany. In both northern and southern Germany the prevalence of GCA in this older population was significantly higher in urban than in rural populations (355 per 1 000 000 vs 115 in northern Germany (P<0.01) and 395 vs 220 (P<0.05) in southern Germany). The relative risk for the older urban population having GCA was 2.25-fold higher (95% CI 1.4-3.6) than in the rural population, and for the female population it was 4.7-fold higher in the urban than in the rural areas (95% CI 2.4-9.3). CONCLUSION:In both northern and southern Germany, GCA was significantly more prevalent in urban than in rural populations, especially among people aged > or =50 yr and in women. It remains unclear whether this disparity was due to underdiagnosis of GCA in the rural regions associated with differences in the German health-care system in cities vs rural areas. Further studies must examine the role of (chronic) exposure to the environmental factors characteristic of cities."
21321151,"BACKGROUND: This study determines the prevalence of Congenital Heart Defects (CHD), diagnosed prenatally or in infancy, and fetal and perinatal mortality associated with CHD in Europe. METHODS AND RESULTS: Data were extracted from the European Surveillance of Congenital Anomalies central database for 29 population-based congenital anomaly registries in 16 European countries covering 3.3 million births during the period 2000 to 2005. CHD cases (n=26 598) comprised live births, fetal deaths from 20 weeks gestation, and terminations of pregnancy for fetal anomaly (TOPFA). The average total prevalence of CHD was 8.0 per 1000 births, and live birth prevalence was 7.2 per 1000 births, varying between countries. The total prevalence of nonchromosomal CHD was 7.0 per 1000 births, of which 3.6% were perinatal deaths, 20% prenatally diagnosed, and 5.6% TOPFA. Severe nonchromosomal CHD (ie, excluding ventricular septal defects, atrial septal defects, and pulmonary valve stenosis) occurred in 2.0 per 1000 births, of which 8.1% were perinatal deaths, 40% were prenatally diagnosed, and 14% were TOPFA (TOPFA range between countries 0% to 32%). Live-born CHD associated with Down syndrome occurred in 0.5 per 1000 births, with > 4-fold variation between countries. CONCLUSION: Annually in the European Union, we estimate 36 000 children are live born with CHD and 3000 who are diagnosed with CHD die as a TOFPA, late fetal death, or early neonatal death. Investing in primary prevention and pathogenetic research is essential to reduce this burden, as well as continuing to improve cardiac services from in utero to adulthood."
30979859,"OBJECTIVE:The goal of the present work, based on a collaborative research registry in Italy (the Salento-Brescia Registry), was to assess the incidence of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and to define the frequencies of different FTLD phenotypes in the general population. METHODS:The study was conducted from January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2017, in 2 Italian provinces: Lecce (in Puglia) in the south (area 2,799.07 km2, inhabitants 802,082) and Brescia (in Lombardy) in the north (area 4,785.62 km2, inhabitants 1,262,678). During the study period, all new cases of FTLD (incident FTLD) were counted, and all patients' records were reviewed. The incidence was standardized to the Italian general population in 2017. RESULTS:In the 2 provinces, 63 patients with FTLD were diagnosed. The incidence rate for FTLD was 3.05 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.34-3.90) per 100,000 person-years (py), while the age-sex standardized incidence rate was 3.09 (95% CI 2.95-3.23) per 100,000 py. In the Italian population, the lifetime risk was 1:400. There was a progressive increase in FTLD incidence across age groups, reaching its peak in the 75- to 79-year-old group, with an incidence rate of 15.97 (95% CI 8.94-26.33) per 100,000 py. The behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia was the most common phenotype (37%). No difference in crude incidence rate between the 2 provinces was observed. CONCLUSION:FTLD is a more common form of dementia than previously recognized, with a risk spanning in a wide age range and with maximum incidence in the mid-70s. Improved knowledge of FTLD epidemiology will help to provide appropriate public health service policies."
21986511,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Hypercalcaemia is a potentially life-threatening condition. Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia (FHH) is a rare, lifelong, benign condition. It is important to separate this condition from other hypercalcaemic states such as hypercalcaemia of malignancy and primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT). RECENT FINDINGS: FHH is caused by inactivating mutations in the calcium sensing receptor (CASR) gene leading to a general calcium-hyposensitivity, compensatory hypercalcaemia and hypocalciuria. The inheritance of FHH is autosomal dominant. Similar to PHPT, FHH is characterized by hypercalcaemia, unsuppressed or elevated plasma parathyroid hormone, and typically normal renal function. The phenotype is normal, and hypercalcaemic symptoms are generally absent. The hallmark is a relatively low urine calcium excretion in contrast to PHPT, in which urine calcium excretion is increased. The vitamin D status as measured by plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D has been reported to be normal with normal seasonal variations, whereas plasma 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D has been found slightly increased compared to normal. Bone mineral density Z-scores are normal in spite of a slightly increased bone turnover. Differential diagnoses include mainly PHPT, but in some cases also hypercalcaemia of malignancy and use of thiazide diuretics. SUMMARY: In general, FHH does not require treatment. We recommend a two-step diagnostic procedure. First, the calcium/creatinine clearance ratio is measured from a 24-h urine. Second, all patients with calcium/creatinine clearance ratio of 0.020 or less are tested for mutations in the CASR gene. The diagnostic sensitivity of this setup is 98%."
1126051,"Friedreich's ataxia (FA) was investigated in Western Norway, an area comprising several isolated communities and with a population of 725,000 as at 1 January 1968. The prevalence of FA was estimated to be 1/100,000 in this population. An autosomal recessive mode of transmission appeared likely in all instances. The gene frequency was only 7-9.10 minus 5, but the consanguinity rate was high in the families observed. The mutation rate was relatively high at 1-6.10 minus 5. The clinical features displayed by the 10 examined patients agreed well with those observed by other investigators. Spinal and cerebellar ataxia dominated the clinical picture. In most cases signs of peripheral neuropathy were also observed. Epilepsy was seen in some cases, and also dementia. Unspecific neuropathy, defined according to a scoring system may represent disease manifestation in FA heterozygotes."
17553910,"OBJECTIVES: To estimate the point prevalence (p.p.) of Wegener's granulomatosis (WG), microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) and Churg-Strauss syndrome (CSS) within a defined population in southern Sweden. METHOD: A cross-sectional p.p. study using multiple sources for case identification. The study area, a healthcare district around the city of Lund in southern Sweden (Mellersta Skånes sjukvårdsdistrikt), had, on 31 December 2002, a total population of 287 479 inhabitants. All the identified cases were verified by medical record review. The patients were classified according to an algorithm based on the American College of Rheumatology classification criteria 1990 and the Chapel Hill Consensus Conference definitions 1994. RESULTS: Eighty-six patients (49% female) with a median age of 64.8 yrs (range 15-90.5) fulfilled the study criteria. There were 46 patients with WG; 27 with MPA; nine with PAN; and four with CSS. The p.p. per million inhabitants was estimated on 1 January 2003 to be 160 (95% confidence interval 114-206) for WG, 94 (58-129) for MPA, 31 (11-52) for PAN and 14 (0.3-27) for CSS. Capture-recapture analysis estimated the completeness of the case finding to 96%. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of WG, MPA, PAN and CSS in our district is the highest figure reported so far. Explanations for this finding may include high incidence, extensive ANCA-testing, good survival as well as sensitive search methods for case identification."
10951457,"Stenosis, atresia, or absence of part of the duodenum, jejunum, or ileum are generally considered small intestinal atresias (SIAs). SIAs occur as isolated defects, in combination with other unrelated congenital anomalies, or as part of syndromes. We performed an epidemiological study of infants with isolated SIAs using data from two large congenital defects registries, one from Latin America (ECLAMC) and the other from Spain (ECEMC). The overall prevalence of SIAs is similar in both programs, being 1.32 per 10,000 livebirths in Spain and 1.29 per 10.000 livebirths in Latin America. Our results suggest that infants with isolated SIAs are characterized epidemiologically on the basis of shorter gestational age and low birthweight, an association with twinning, the parents are more frequently consanguineous, and their pregnancies are more frequently complicated by vaginal bleeding. The results also suggest an association between some maternal infections and ileal atresia. The fact that these characteristics have been observed in children with these types of anomalies occurring in different geographical areas and populations supports the conclusion that these characteristics are causally related to these defects."
11326012,"We determined the value of a new serological assay detecting Toxoplasma-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgA antibodies at birth for use in mass neonatal screening. The incidence of congenital infection in newborns was compared with data from an epidemiological investigation on the seroprevalence of Toxoplasma in the studied population. Peripheral blood was collected on Guthrie cards during the first 3 days of life and tested for anti-Toxoplasma IgA and IgM using a noncommercial immunocapture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). When the screening assay was positive, serum samples from the child and the mother were collected for use in Western blotting comparative immunological profile analysis and traditional serological tests for determination of specific IgG, IgM, and IgA antibodies. From December 1998 to April 2000, 17,653 filter paper samples from live-born neonates were successively screened. Congenital T. gondii infection was finally confirmed in 19 newborns. In traditional assays, 13 of 19 infants were IgM and IgA positive using filter paper eluates at birth, 1 child was positive only for IgM, 1 patient was positive for IgM and borderline for IgA, 1 had an equivocal level of IgA, and 3 cases were confirmed only by the Western blot assay. The prevalence of Toxoplasma-specific IgA and/or IgM in filter paper samples at birth was 1 per 929 live-born neonates (1.08/1,000) or about 1 per 523 children (1.9/1,000) born to nonimmune women with a potential risk of primary T. gondii infection during pregnancy, compared to the actual seropositivity rate of 43.7%. The diagnostic sensitivity of the combined IgA-IgM ELISA using neonatal filter paper specimens was not more than 95%, the positive predictive value of the test was 82.6%, and the diagnostic specificity was calculated to be 99.9%. The combined IgA-IgM ELISA is a valuable method for the diagnosis of congenital toxoplasmosis at birth and fulfills criteria for neonatal screening programs. The method showed a good diagnostic sensitivity in neonates untreated prenatally who were born in an area of high seroprevalence of T. gondii infection."
9610798,"OBJECTIVE:To assess birth and gene frequencies of specific autosomal recessively inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) within different ethnic groups. DESIGN:Retrospective study in a regional centre for investigation and treatment of IEM. SUBJECTS:All children born within the West Midlands NHS Region, UK, during the decade immediately preceding the 1991 National Census. METHODS:Birth frequencies for individual IEM were calculated separately for the main ethnic groups in the West Midlands using data from the West Midlands Neonatal Screening Programme, the regional register of IEM patients, and population frequencies from the National Census. Gene frequencies were calculated using previously documented observations on parental consanguinity rates and inbreeding coefficients. RESULTS:The overall incidence of recorded IEM was tenfold higher among Pakistanis compared to white children (1:318 v 1:3760), whereas only one AfroCaribbean child was identified (incidence 1:16 887). Tyrosinaemia type 1, cystinosis, mucopolysaccharidosis type 1, non-ketotic hyperglycinaemia, and hyperchylomicronaemia all occurred more frequently among Pakistanis. An increased gene frequency was only confirmed for tyrosinaemia. The incidence of phenylketonuria was similar in Pakistani and white children (1:14 452 v 1:12 611), but the gene frequency was significantly lower in Pakistanis (1:713 v 1:112). These results illustrate the interplay between gene frequency and parental consanguinity in determining disease frequencies in different populations, and indicate anticipated disease frequencies in the absence of consanguineous marriage. These figures have implications for the organisation of services for management of inborn errors, for genetic counselling, and for the assessment of gene flow in world populations."
15696553,"OBJECTIVE: To register all newly diagnosed patients with primary systemic vasculitides (PSV) in a large region in northern Germany. METHODS: Between January 1, 1998 and December 31, 2002 all newly diagnosed cases of PSV were identified in a large mixed rural/urban northern German region consisting of 2,777,275 habitants in a population-based prospective study. The following sources were used: departments of all hospitals, including their outpatient clinics; all departments of pathology; and the reference immunologic labs serving the catchment area. RESULTS: During 5 years, 642 PSV patients were identified. The incidence rates for all PSV were between 40 and 54 cases per 1 million and per year. People at age 50 years and older had a 3-5-fold higher risk of developing PSV compared with those younger than 50 years. The incidence rates of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated PSV (Wegener's granulomatosis [WG], microscopic polyangiitis [MPA], Churg-Strauss syndrome [CSS]) were between 9.5 and 16/million/year. WG occured 2-3 times more frequently than MPA or CSS. CONCLUSION: Results of a population-based vasculitis register over 5 years for the incidence of PSV among 2.78 million habitants in northern Germany revealed a stable incidence for all PSV. Compared with other European studies coming from small regions or referral centers, the incidence rates for ANCA-associated PSV were the same as in Norway, lower than those in United Kingdom, but higher than those in Spain."
15765398,"BACKGROUND & AIMS:The incidence of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma has been recently increasing in the United States. In this case-control study, we used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database to evaluate the prevalence of known risk factors for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and explore other potential risk factors. METHODS:We identified all patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma aged 65 years and older diagnosed between 1993 and 1999 in the population-based Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registries (14% of the US population). Controls were randomly chosen from individuals without any cancer diagnosis in the underlying population of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results regions. We obtained information on risk factors from Medicare claims (parts A and B) for all cases and controls with at least 2 years of continuous Medicare enrollment. Unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios were calculated in logistic regression analysis. RESULTS:A total of 625 cases and 90,834 controls satisfied the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Cases were older than controls (78.7 vs. 76.5 years; P=.02) and were more likely to be male (48.3% vs. 36.8%; P <.0001). The racial composition was similar between cases and controls. Several risk factors were significantly more prevalent among cases. These included nonspecific cirrhosis (adjusted odds ratio, 27.2; P <.0001), alcoholic liver disease (adjusted odds ratio, 7.4; P <.0001), hepatitis C virus infection (adjusted odds ratio, 6.1; P <.0001), human immunodeficiency virus infection (adjusted odds ratio, 5.9; P=.003), diabetes (adjusted odds ratio, 2.0; P <.0001), and inflammatory bowel diseases (adjusted odds ratio, 2.3; P=.002). CONCLUSIONS:This population-based study shows that in addition to previously well described risk factors, several others could be associated with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. These include hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus, liver cirrhosis, and diabetes."
7381651,"Information was collected on 301 cases of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome in the United States and Canada Examination of available medical records, death certificates and published case reports on these patients showed that they came from a wide geographic area and many diverse ethnic and racial groups. No significant difference was found in the incidence of cases born between 1947 and 1976; the overall rate was 4.0 per million live male births in the United States. Median survival has increased with time from eight months for patients born before 1935 to 6.5 years for those born after 1964. Seventy-six of the 301 patients (25%) were still alive at last follow-up and ranged in age from 1 to 36 years with a median of 10 years. Causes of death were primarily limited to infections or bleeding, but malignancy represented a significant problem. Twelve percent of the group (36 of 301) developed malignancy, the predominant types being lymphorecticular tumors (23 of 36) and leukemia (7 of 36). The overall relative risk for malignancy was found to be greater than 100 times that of the general population and was found to increase with increasing age."
16700943,"Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in the TSC1 and TSC2 genes on chromosomes 9 and 16 respectively. Diagnosis is based on clinical features but can be difficult as a result of variable phenotypic expression. With the advantage of mutation analysis in making a diagnosis of TSC, and improved identification of the associated clinical features, there have been few new data on its prevalence and on the proportion of cases due to new mutations. We have performed a retrospective epidemiological study on the prevalence of TSC, the clinical features attributed to it, and the availability of mutational analysis. We identified 73 known patients with TSC (5 deceased): 39 were female and 34 male. Ages ranged from 10 months to 69 years, with a mean age of 27 years 11 months (SD 16y 10mo). The point prevalence of TSC in our study was estimated at 1 out of 24 956 on the prevalence day (30 April 2004). The majority of patients (42.5%) were diagnosed at less than 15 months of age; 25% were not given a diagnosis on first developing symptoms. In all, 93.2% had epilepsy and 71.2% had a learning disability. A mutation was identified in 95.8% of those tested (26% TSC1 and 74% TSC2). TSC2 mutations were correlated with a more severe phenotype. The new mutation rate was calculated at 64%. We conclude that the prevalence of TSC is higher than previously calculated. We recommend that all children with epilepsy be assessed for features of TSC. Larger studies will be required to assess the prevalence of mutations in each gene, and genotype-phenotype correlation."
16159904,"BACKGROUND: Pyridoxine dependent epilepsy is a rare cause of seizures in childhood. The diagnosis is made on clinical criteria, that in many cases are never met. Therefore, epidemiological data on pyridoxine dependency are scarce. AIMS: To study the epidemiology of pyridoxine dependent epilepsy in the Netherlands, and to determine whether the diagnosis is based on the appropriate criteria. METHODS: Nationwide all departments of paediatrics (n = 113) and of paediatric or neonatal neurology (n = 17) were asked to report cases of pyridoxine dependent seizures. Birth incidences were calculated using national data on live births from 1991 to 2003. RESULTS: Response was received from 67% of paediatric departments, including all university hospitals and 94% of child neurology departments. Thirteen patients were reported. Four definite (31%), three probable (23%), and four possible cases (31%) were identified. Two cases (15%) did not meet criteria for either of these groups. The birth incidence was 1:396,000 for definite and probable cases and 1:252,000 when possible cases are included. CONCLUSIONS: Thus far, epidemiological data on pyridoxine dependent seizures were only available from the UK and Ireland. A higher incidence was found in the Netherlands, in accordance with earlier suggestions of a regional difference. The study shows that the diagnosis is often made without performance of a formal trial of withdrawal. The importance of confirming the diagnosis, concerning the consequences as for individual prognosis, the potential side effects of prolonged pyridoxine substitution, and the possibility of treating the mother in case of future pregnancies are emphasised."
30887555,"BACKGROUND:The frequency of eosinophilic oesophagitis (EoE) occurrence is escalating. Current diagnostic criteria recently proposed for the disease, determine that previous estimates of incidence and prevalence are outdated. AIM:To gauge the current incidence and prevalence of EoE by performing a systematic review of population-based studies. METHODS:Three electronic databases were searched from their inception dates to September 2018. A total of 2386 documents were screened; 29 studies reported on the prevalence and incidence of EoE in the general population. RESULTS:The pooled prevalence of EoE was 34.4 cases per 100 000 inhabitants (95% CI, 23.1-47.5), and was higher for adults (42.2; 95% CI, 31.1-55) than for children (34; 95% CI, 22.3-49.2). The pooled EoE incidence rates were 6.6/100 000 person-years (95% CI, 3-11.7) in children and 7.7/100 000 (95% CI, 1.8-17.8) in adults. No differences were found between North American and European studies using varied sources of data (insurance and administrative databases compared to hospital-bases case series). Subgroup analysis according to risk of bias did not change results significantly. A steady rise in EoE incidence and prevalence rates was observed over time, comparing studies conducted under subsequent definitions for EoE. No significant publication bias was found. CONCLUSIONS:In a systematic review and meta-analysis, we found a sharp increase, higher than previous estimates, in the incidence and prevalence of EoE in population based studies. Results from studies carried out in developed countries show broad consistency and provide evidence of increasing pooled prevalence and incidence of EoE rates over time."
15213329,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of systemic sclerosis (SSc) in a French multi-ethnic population and to examine ethnic differences. METHODS: This survey was conducted in Seine-Saint-Denis County, a suburb of Paris, home to 1,094,412 adults (>/=15 yr), among whom 26% are of non-European background with mainly northern and sub-Saharan African, Asian and Caribbean ancestries. The study period comprised the entire calendar year 2001. Patients were ascertained through four sources: public and private hospitals, general practitioners and community specialists, the French SSc patient support group, and the National Public Health Insurance System database. Only cases meeting either the 1980 ACR and/or LeRoy and Medsger's classification criteria were included and assigned to three clinical subsets: limited (normal skin) (l), limited cutaneous (lc) or diffuse cutaneous (dc) SSc. Capture-recapture (CR) analyses using log-linear modelling were performed to correct for incomplete case finding. RESULTS: We retained a total of 119 patients with SSc, including 15 extrapolated from inaccessible files. CR analysis estimated that 54.2 additional cases were missed by all the sources. The overall SSc prevalence (per million adults) was 158.3 (95% confidence interval, 129-187); those of lSSc, lcSSc and dcSSc were, respectively, 32.3 (16-48), 83.1 (66-101) and 42.9 (25-60); and respective values for Europeans and non-Europeans were 140.2 (112-170) and 210.8 (128-293). CONCLUSION: Regarding the heterogeneity of previously published estimates, this population-based survey using CR analysis might contribute to obtaining a better appraisal of SSc prevalence. Despite overlapping confidence intervals, the higher prevalence observed for non-Europeans could support potential influences of ethnic origin on the pathogenesis of SSc."
2601109,"An estimation of the prevalence of epidermolysis bullosa was carried out in Japan. A questionnaire was sent by mail to the departments of dermatology and pediatrics in 644 main hospitals throughout Japan requesting confirmation of the number of epidermolysis bullosa cases experienced. The response rate was 63.0% or 406 hospitals. Based on the secondary questionnaire survey, we confirmed 393 cases of epidermolysis bullosa, and then divided them into the five following groups: ""simplex"" type 182 (48.2%), ""junctional"" type 23 (6.0%), ""dominant dystrophic"" type 72 (18.7%), ""recessive dystrophic"" type 109 (28.2%), unclassified 7 (1.8%). Using the respondent rate by geographic region and clinical department, the estimated prevalence of each type of epidermolysis bullosa was calculated as follows: ""simplex"" type 340-470 (0.29-0.40 per 100,000 population), ""junctional"" type 18-24 (0.015-0.020), ""dominant dystrophic"" type 130-180 (0.11-0.15) and ""recessive dystrophic"" type 180-250 (0.15-0.21). The total number of epidermolysis bullosa patients in Japan was estimated as being more than 670 in 1983."
21960648,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the lifetime prevalence of trigeminal neuralgia (TN) and persistent idiopathic facial pain (PIFP) in a population-based sample in Germany. METHODS: A total of 3336 responders of 6000 contacted inhabitants of the city of Essen in Germany were screened using a self-assessment questionnaire. 327 individuals, who reported recurrent facial pain and randomly selected 150 (5% of 3009) screening negative subjects, received a phone interview by one of six neurologists and if necessary a face-to-face examination. Those with suspected TN or PIFP following the phone interview underwent neurological examination by two neurologists who were unaware of the presumed diagnosis. A random group of 25 (10% of 247) phone interview negative subjects was examined face-to-face. All suspected cases of PIFP received otorhinolaryngological examination and diagnostic cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In TN patients the number of vessel-nerve contacts was determined by thin-slice cranial MRI. RESULTS: Lifetime prevalence of TN was estimated to be 0.3% [10 of 3336; 95% CI 0.1-0.5%], of PIFP 0.03% [1 of 3336; 95% CI < 0.08%]. Thin-slice cranial MRI detected five vessel-nerve contacts and no symptomatic lesions in the 10 TN patients. CONCLUSIONS: This large population-based study revealed that TN and PIFP are rare facial pain disorders."
19339254,"A population-based, cross-sectional study was performed in southeast Norway, between January 2002 and February 2008, to identify subjects with hereditary ataxia and hereditary spastic paraplegia, and to estimate the prevalence of these disorders. Patients were recruited through colleagues, families, searches in computerized hospital archives and the National Patients' Association for Hereditary Ataxia and Spastic Paraplegia. Strict criteria were used for inclusion of familial and isolated subjects. A project neurologist examined all index subjects and clinical and genetic data were registered. The source population on January 1, 2008 was 2.63 million and the prevalence day was set as February 1, 2008. One hundred seventy-one subjects from 87 unrelated families with hereditary ataxia and 194 subjects from 65 unrelated families with hereditary spastic paraplegia were included. The total prevalence was estimated at 13.9/100 000. Hereditary ataxia prevalence in the region was estimated at 6.5/100 000: 4.2/100 000 for autosomal-dominant and 2.3/100 000 for autosomal recessive, 0.15/100 000 for Friedreich's ataxia and 0.4/100 000 for ataxia telangiectasia. Hereditary spastic paraplegia prevalence was 7.4/100 000: 5.5/100 000 for autosomal dominant-hereditary spastic paraplegia, 0.6/100 000 for autosomal recessive-hereditary spastic paraplegia and 1.3/100 000 for isolated subjects. Marked differences were found in the frequencies of hereditary ataxia subtypes compared with other countries, while those of the most common autosomal dominant-hereditary spastic paraplegia genotypes, SPG4, SPG3 and SPG31, were similar to those previously reported. Clear variations between age groups and counties were observed, but no gender differences. Mean age on prevalence day was 48 years, mean age at onset was 24 years. We present the largest population study performed on hereditary ataxia and hereditary spastic paraplegia prevalence and report a higher prevalence than expected. Better inclusion criteria and multiple search strategies may explain the observed differences."
21108439,"BACKGROUND:The incidence, survival, and prevalence of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) in children were determined as a first step in improving diagnosis and therapy. Outcomes were compared with neuroblastoma, a pediatric malignancy that shares several biomarkers. METHODS:Incidence rates, observed survival rates and 31-year limited duration prevalence counts were obtained from SEER*Stat for diagnosis years 1975 to 2006. These rates were compared between and within NETs and neuroblastoma for demographic and tumor-related variables from nine standard SEER registries for ages 0-29 years. Multivariate Cox regression was performed to identify prognostic factors for survival in NETs. RESULTS:The number of NETs was 1,073 compared to 1,664 neuroblastomas. The most common NET sites were lung, breast, and appendix. NET 5-year observed survival rates increased from 83% between 1975 and 1979 to 84% for the 2000-2006 period, while analogous neuroblastoma survival rates steadily increased from 45-73%. Five-year observed survival was less than 30% in females with NETs of the cervix and ovary. The estimated 31-year limited duration prevalence for NETs as of January 1, 2006 in the U.S. population was 7,724 compared to 9,960 for neuroblastomas. Age-adjusted multivariate Cox Regression demonstrated small cell histology, primary location in the breast, and distant stage as major predictors of decreased survival. CONCLUSIONS:While survivorship has significantly increased for neuroblastoma, those diagnosed with NETs have shown no increase in survival during this 31-year period. NETs constitute an unrecognized cancer threat to children and young adults comparable to neuroblastoma in both number of affected persons and disease severity."
11595021,"The advent of the direct mutation test for Huntington disease (HD) has made it possible to identify a previously unrecognized symptomatic population of HD, including those with an atypical presentation or patients without a family history of HD. The present study investigated the uptake of this test in the province of British Columbia (BC), Canada and assessed the incidence rate and rate of identification of new mutations for HD. All symptomatic individuals residing in BC who were referred for the genetic test for HD between 1993 and 2000 (n=205) were analyzed for CAG expansion, baseline demographics and clinical data, and a family history of HD. A total of 141 (or 68.8%) had a CAG expansion > or =36. Of these, almost one-quarter (24.1%) did not have a family history of HD. An extensive chart review revealed that 11 patients (or 7.8%) had reliable information on both parents (who lived well into old age) and therefore possibly could represent new mutations for HD. This indicates a three to four times higher new mutation rate than previously reported. Our findings also show that the yearly incidence rate for HD was 6.9 per million, which is two times higher than previous incidence studies performed prior to the identification of the HD mutation. We also identified five persons with a clinical presentation of HD but without CAG expansion (genocopies) (2.4%)."
18325769,"Short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache with conjunctival injection and tearing (SUNCT) and short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with cranial autonomic symptoms (SUNA) are considered to be rare primary headache disorders. The purpose of this study was to define the clinical features, response to prophylactic treatment and efficacy of lignocaine by subcutaneous infusion for periods of acute exacerbation requiring hospitalisation. Over a period of 6 years (March 2000--February 2006) all cases of SUNCT and SUNA in neurology clinics at the Gold Coast Hospital, Australia, were reviewed. International Headache Society diagnostic criteria were used. Clinical features and response to treatment were prospectively recorded using headache diaries and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain was carried out. Twenty-four subjects with SUNCT or SUNA were identified. The incidence of these conditions was 1.2/100,000 and the prevalence 6.6/100,000. An episodic disease course was evident in 14/24 (58%) cases, whereas 10/24 (42%) had a chronic course. An aberrant vessel in close association with the fifth cranial nerve was seen in 88% of cases. A good or excellent response to lamotrigine was seen in 11/19 (58%) and was more effective in the episodic group (100%). A subcutaneous infusion of lignocaine proved completely effective on 11/14 (78%) occasions. SUNCT and SUNA are not rare conditions. Characterisation into episodic and chronic disease course appears to be of prognostic and therapeutic importance. Lamotrigine is effective in the majority of cases and subcutaneous lignocaine is useful as acute treatment for severe recalcitrant attacks."
22133668,"Recent debate suggests Huntington's disease (HD) may be more prevalent than previously reported. In addition, relatively little is known about current disease management. This study aims to provide epidemiological data and describe the pharmacological management of HD in the United Kingdom.A primary care research database was accessed to identify incident and prevalent HD cases between January 1, 2004, and December 31, 2008. Patients with Read codes denoting a definite diagnosis or possible diagnosis, and undiagnosed patients with a positive family history were identified. A subset of patients with a definite diagnosis and prescribed medication indicating symptom onset was also identified. Epidemiological data were estimated. Pharmacological prescriptions to HD patients from 2004 to 2008 were identified, and prescription frequencies were grouped according to the British National Formulary categories.HD incidence estimates ranged from 0.44 to 0.78 per 100,000 person-years, and HD prevalence ranged from 5.96 to 6.54 per 100,000 of the population. Forty-four percent of pharmacological prescriptions targeted the central nervous system. Nearly half of the HD patients were prescribed antidepressants, and over 40% were prescribed analgesics.Although prevalence estimates fell short of figures suggested in recent debate, it is feasible that the true prevalence may be much higher than previously reported. Pharmacological management appears to rely heavily on central nervous system drugs and nutrition support. Many of these drugs are prescribed to HD patients for reasons other than the medication's primary use. Further work is required to evaluate the impact of alternative management strategies, such as therapist intervention, counselling, and organisation support, on the patients' quality of life."
18983653,"BACKGROUND: Current data on incidence of interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) are sparse and concerns about an increasing trend have been raised. We examined incidence rates (IRs) of ILDs and changes in IRs between 1995 and 2005. METHODS: All persons with a first-time hospital discharge or outpatient diagnosis of ILD were identified through the Danish National Registry of Patients, which covers all Danish hospitals. Crude and age-standardised IRs were computed for ILD overall, as well as stratified by ILD subcategories. RESULTS: A total of 21,765 patients with ILD were identified. Between 1995 and 1998 the overall standardised IR of ILD decreased from 27.14 (95% CI 25.82-28.46) per 100,000 person-years to 19.36 (95% CI 18.26-20.46) per 100,000 person-years. After 1998 the IR increased considerably, peaking at 34.34 (95% CI 32.84-35.85) per 100,000 person-years in 2002. Subsequently there was a slight decrease. The highest IR was observed in the non-specific category ""Respiratory disorders in diseases classified elsewhere"". By ILD subcategory, the greatest average increase during the study period was observed in ""Respiratory disorders in diseases classified elsewhere"". CONCLUSION: The incidence rate of ILD in Denmark increased during the study period, most pronounced for ILDs associated with systemic diseases."
2339046,"Advances in surgical treatment of hypoplastic left heart syndrome with the Norwood procedure and cardiac transplantation have made essential the understanding of the natural history of hypoplastic left heart syndrome. In a geographically defined population, we ascertained the prevalence of hypoplastic left heart syndrome in children born in Oregon from 1971 through 1986. Clinical and anatomic data were extracted from the charts of the 98 affected children and the survival rate was calculated. Hypoplastic left heart syndrome occurred in 0.162 per 1000 live births in Oregon during this period. No syndrome complex was prevalent and 84% were free of other congenital malformations. However, there was an increased occurrence of congenital heart defects in first-degree relatives of probands with hypoplastic left heart syndrome. Of the affected children 15 +/- 4% died on the first day of life, 70 +/- 5% died within the first week, and 91 +/- 3% died within 30 days. No secular change in survival occurred during the study. Palliation with the Norwood procedure was performed in 20 children. Although survival was significantly improved with this surgery (P = .01), the effect was observed principally through 30 days of life and only one of these children remains alive. Hypoplastic left heart syndrome is a lethal congenital heart defect in children and poses management and ethical dilemmas."
19456307,"OBJECTIVES: Narcolepsy is a lifelong disabling disorder that may be alleviated by relevant treatment. Patients frequently report 10-15 years from the first symptoms to the time they get the diagnosis and treatment can be started. In order to offer a sufficient diagnostic and therapeutic service to this patient group, a reliable estimation of the prevalence of the disorder is important. A study of the prevalence of narcolepsy with cataplexy in Norway was therefore undertaken. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Ullanlinna Narcolepsy scale (UNS) was sent to 14548 randomly selected Norwegians between 20 and 60 years. Additionally, the study included telephone interviews and clinical evaluation of responders with >or=14 points on the UNS, and in those with suspected narcolepsy, polygraphic sleep recordings and human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-typing. RESULTS: A total of 8992 responders answered the questionnaire (response rate 61.8%), 267 had >or=14 points on the UNS, 156 were interviewed and 15 had sleep recordings. In two HLADQB1*0602-positive patients sleep recordings were compatible with narcolepsy. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate a prevalence of 0.022% and approximately 1000 patients with narcolepsy with cataplexy in Norway."
17886296,"OBJECTIVE:Diverse and variable clinical features, a loose genotype-phenotype relationship, and presentation to different medical specialties have all hindered attempts to gauge the epidemiological impact of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) disease. Nevertheless, a clear understanding of its prevalence remains an important goal, particularly about planning appropriate clinical services. Consequently, the aim of this study was to accurately define the prevalence of mtDNA disease (primary mutation occurs in mtDNA) in the working-age population of the North East of England. METHODS:Adults with suspected mitochondrial disease in the North East of England were referred to a single neurology center for investigation from 1990 to 2004. Those with pathogenic mtDNA mutations were identified and pedigree analysis performed. For the midyear period of 2001, we calculated the minimum point prevalence of mtDNA disease for adults of working age (>16 and <60/65 years for female/male patients, respectively). RESULTS:In this population, we found that 9.2 in 100,000 people have clinically manifest mtDNA disease, making this one of the commonest inherited neuromuscular disorders. In addition, a further 16.5 in 100,000 children and adults younger than retirement age are at risk for development of mtDNA disease. INTERPRETATION:Through detailed pedigree analysis and active family tracing, we have been able to provide revised minimum prevalence figures for mtDNA disease. These estimates confirm that mtDNA disease is a common cause of chronic morbidity and is more prevalent than has been previously appreciated."
27145453,"Mueller-Weiss syndrome is a complex condition of the adult tarsal navicular characterized by progressive fragmentation leading to mid- and hindfoot pain and deformity. Since its first descriptions in the early 20th century, controversy has persisted regarding its pathogenesis.This article reviews the literature and discusses the anatomy, epidemiology, causes, clinical and radiologic findings, and treatment of Mueller-Weiss syndrome, and thus permits a better understanding of this disease and its management."
7825085,"A genetic service for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) was initiated in Cape Town in 1987. Of the 143 DMD patients diagnosed during the period 1987-1992, 66 had a familial pattern of inheritance and 77 were apparently sporadic. Twenty BMD patients were identified, of whom 12 had other affected relatives and 8 were sporadic. Overall minimum prevalence rates of 1/100,000 for DMD and 1/755,000 for BMD were calculated. A markedly low DMD prevalence in the indigenous black population (1/250,000) contributed to the overall low DMD prevalence in South Africa when compared with that in the UK (1/40,000). By means of molecular methods, the diagnosis in 42% of the affected DMD males was confirmed by detection of deletions in the dystrophin gene. Deletions were identified in 50% of Indian, white and mixed ancestry patients. In contrast, only 22% of blacks had identifiable deletions. DMD appears to be underrepresented in the black population; the low deletion frequency in this group suggests that unique mutations not detectable by methods used in this study may be more frequent in these patients than in the other populations. The increased DMD frequency in Indians corroborates findings reported from the UK."
19777544,"BACKGROUND: Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR) is a potentially fatal congenital intestinal obstruction syndrome. For birth years 1996-2002, reported HSCR prevalence in Alaska was approximately six times higher than the national estimate of two per 10,000 live births. In 2008 we completed a case verification study of HSCR reported to the Alaska Birth Defects Registry (ABDR) to verify prevalence and evaluate sensitivity and predictive value of HSCR surveillance. METHODS: We abstracted medical records for children reported with HSCR who were born in 1996-2007 and matched to an Alaska birth certificate. We categorized reports as confirmed, ruled out, or inconclusive. ABDR sensitivity was validated by cross-referencing hospital discharge data with confirmed HSCR cases. RESULTS: Overall sensitivity of the ABDR was 94.4%, and positive predictive value (PPV) was 31.1%. Following case verification, HSCR prevalence was three per 10,000 live births statewide and 5.6 and 2.1 per 10,000 live births for Alaska Natives and non-Natives, respectively. Positive predictive value was twice as high for the Alaska Native population as the non-Native population. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple-source passive surveillance methodology resulted in high sensitivity for HSCR ascertainment; however, case verification was required to rule out false-positive reports, which obscured the true distribution of Alaska Native versus non-Native HSCR cases."
19767415,"We have performed a detailed population study of patients with genetic muscle disease in the northern region of England. Our current clinic population comprises over 1100 patients in whom we have molecularly characterized 31 separate muscle disease entities. Diagnostic clarity achieved through careful delineation of clinical features supported by histological, immunological and genetic analysis has allowed us to reach a definitive diagnosis in 75.7% of our patients. We have compared our case profile with that from Walton and Nattrass' seminal study from 1954, also of the northern region, together with data from other more recent studies from around the world. Point prevalence figures for each of the five major disease categories are comparable with those from other recent studies. Myotonic dystrophies are the most common, comprising 28.6% of our clinic population with a point prevalence of 10.6/100,000. Next most frequent are the dystrophinopathies and facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy making up 22.9% (8.46/100,000) and 10.7% (3.95/100,000) of the clinic population, respectively. Spinal muscular atrophy patients account for 5.1% or 1.87/100,000 patients. Limb girdle muscular dystrophy, which was described for the first time in the paper by Walton and Nattrass (1954) and comprised 17% of their clinic population, comprises 6.2% of our clinic population at a combined prevalence of 2.27/100,000. The clinic population included patients with 12 other muscle disorders. These disorders ranged from a point prevalence of 0.89/100 000 for the group of congenital muscular dystrophies to conditions with only two affected individuals in a population of three million. For the first time our study provides epidemiological information for X-linked Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy and the collagen VI disorders. Each of the X-linked form of Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy and Ullrich muscular dystrophy has a prevalence of 0.13/100,000, making both very rare. Bethlem myopathy was relatively more common with a prevalence of 0.77/100,000. Overall our study provides comprehensive epidemiological information on individually rare inherited neuromuscular conditions in Northern England. Despite the deliberate exclusion of relatively common groups such as hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy (40/100,000) and mitochondrial disorders (9.2/100,000), the combined prevalence is 37.0/100,000, demonstrating that these disorders, taken as a group, encompass a significant proportion of patients with chronic disease. The study also illustrates the immense diagnostic progress since the first regional survey over 50 years ago by Walton and Nattrass."
23363926,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to analyze the prevalence and incidence of adult-onset myasthenia gravis (MG) in the Belgrade population from 1979 to 2008. METHODS: Data on the number of MG patients and their basic demographic and clinical characteristics were collected from hospital records (1979-1992) and the Belgrade MG Registry (1993-2008). Incidence and prevalence were standardized by the direct method (using the world standard population). A time-trend analysis of MG incidence was performed using a linear regression model. RESULTS: During the study period 562 cases (316 women, 246 men) were registered. On December 31st, 2008, the standardized prevalence (according to the world standard population) was 188.3/1,000,000 (women: 237.8/1,000,000; men: 139.4/1,000,000). The average annual standardized incidence rate was 13.3/1,000,000 (women: 14.1/1,000,000; men: 12.2/1,000,000). The incidence rates tended to increase significantly in both sexes during the study period (y = 3.299 + 14.363x, p = 0.002). Age-specific incidence rates for women demonstrated a bimodal pattern, with the first peak in the 20- to 29-year age group and the second one in the ≥70-year group. For both genders, an increase in age-specific incidence rates was registered for all age groups, although this was significant (p = 0.001) only for an MG onset of ≥60 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: The study confirms an increase in the incidence of MG in the area of Belgrade during the study period, especially for those with MG onset after 60 years of age."
8931572,"A cross-sectional study was performed in the Netherlands to define the clinical characteristics of the various subtypes within the broad and heterogeneous entity of limb girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD). An attempt was made to include all known cases of LGMD in the Netherlands. Out of the reported 200 patients, 105 who fulfilled strictly defined criteria were included. Forty-nine patients, mostly suffering from dystrophinopathies and facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, appeared to be misdiagnosed. Thirty-four cases were sporadic, 42 patients came from autosomal recessive and 29 from autosomal dominant families. The estimated prevalence of LGMD in the Netherlands was at least 8.1 x 10(-6). The clinical features of the autosomal recessive and sporadic cases were indistinguishable from those of the autosomal dominant patients, although calf hypertrophy was seen more frequently, and the course of the disease was more severe in autosomal recessive and sporadic cases. The pectoralis, iliopsoas and gluteal muscles, hip adductors and hamstrings were the most affected muscles. Distal muscle involvement occurred late in the course of the disease. Facial weakness was a rare phenomenon. The severity of the clinical picture was correlated with a deteriorating lung function. All autosomal dominantly inherited cases showed a mild course, although in two families life-expectancy was reduced because of concomitant cardiac involvement."
14608657,"An epidemiological study of the mucopolysaccharidoses in Western Australia (WA) using multiple ascertainment sources was carried out and the incidence rate for the period 1969-1996 was estimated. An incidence of approximately 1 in 107,000 live births was obtained for MPS IH (Hurler phenotype); 1 in 320,000 live births (1 in 165,000 male live births) for MPS II (Hunter Syndrome); 1 in 58,000 for MPS III (Sanfilippo Syndrome); 1 in 640,000 for MPS IVA (Morquio Syndrome type A), and 1 in 320,000 for MPS VI (Maroteaux-Lamy Syndrome). The overall incidence for all types of mucopolysaccharidosis was approximately 1 in 29,000 live births. A comparison is made with incidence estimates obtained from other published studies."
16755586,"An epidemiological survey of primary focal dystonias in the western area of Tottori Prefecture in Japan was conducted in 2003, and the results were compared with those of a previous survey in 1993. The service-based prevalence of primary focal dystonia was 13.7 per 100,000 population, representing an increase from that found in the 1993 survey. In 1997, botulinum toxin type A was approved for use in Japan to treat blepharospasm, and the increased number of patients now being evaluated and diagnosed with focal dystonias at medical centers throughout Japan may be responsible for this increased prevalence. Prevalence by subtype per 100,000 population was as follows: facial dystonia, 6.5; spasmodic torticollis, 2.0; writer's cramp, 4.4; and other focal dystonias; 0.8. Facial dystonia showed the most marked increase in service-based prevalence among these subtypes."
10464606,"Bloom syndrome (BS) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by small stature, immunodeficiency, chromosomal instability, and a predisposition to different types of cancer. Although extremely rare in the general population, BS is seen in about 1 in 48,000 Ashkenazi Jews. Mutation analysis of seven Ashkenazi BS probands has shown that all were homozygous for the same mutation in the BLM gene: 2281delATCTGAinsTAGATTC, also known as blmAsh. This finding, along with the increased incidence of BS among Ashkenazi Jews, suggests a founder effect for BS in this population. The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of blmAsh mutation carriers in a randomly sampled Ashkenazi Jewish population in Israel. The initial study group included 1,613 Ashkenazi Jews who were referred for routine DNA screening tests (cystic fibrosis, Gaucher, Canavan, fragile X). None had a family history of BS. A group of 552 non-Ashkenazi Jews served as controls. Mutation analysis was performed by PCR amplification followed by analysis of a specific BstN1 restriction site, created by the blmAsh mutation. All positive carriers were confirmed by direct sequencing. Sixteen blmAsh carriers were detected among 1,613 Ashkenazi Jews (1 in 101), compared to none among 552 non-Ashkenazi individuals. In this study, Ashkenazi Jews of biparental Polish descent had a significantly higher proportion of the blmAsh mutation (1 in 37) compared to Ashkenazi Jews of non-Polish descent. These results provide further evidence that a founder effect is responsible for the increased incidence of Bloom syndrome among Ashkenazi Jews, particularly those of Polish descent."
8546743,"OBJECTIVE:To estimate the prevalence, annual mortality, and geographic distribution of Wegener's granulomatosis. METHODS:Analysis of national vital statistics data and hospitalization data from a national survey and from all New York State inpatient facilities. RESULTS:Between 1979 and 1988, 1,784 death certificates in the United States listed Wegener's granulomatosis as a cause of death. Nationally, an estimated 10,771 hospitalizations included Wegener's granulomatosis among the discharge diagnoses. In New York State, there were 978 hospitalizations among 571 individuals with Wegener's granulomatosis. CONCLUSION:The prevalence of Wegener's granulomatosis in the United States is approximately 3.0 per 100,000 persons. Clear differences in the geographic distribution of Wegener's granulomatosis are apparent when analysis consider rates of disease in individual counties. Contrary to previous reports, associations between disease exacerbations and season were not apparent."
24500997,"To ascertain the frequency of childhood myasthenia in the UK. Specifically, we aimed to identify the detected incidence of autoimmune myasthenia and the detected prevalence of genetically confirmed congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS) in children.All children under 18 years of age on 31 December 2009 with a confirmed CMS genetic mutation were identified by the only UK laboratory undertaking CMS genetic testing. All cases with positive acetylcholine receptor (AChR) and muscle specific kinase (MuSK) receptor antibodies in the 5 years between 2003 and 2007 inclusive were identified by the testing laboratories. UK census data from 2001 were used as the denominator for analyses.The UK detected prevalence of genetically confirmed CMS was 9.2 per million children under 18 years of age. CMS was equally prevalent in girls and boys. CHRNE, RAPSN and DOK7 were the most commonly identified mutations. Prevalence varied across geographical regions in England (between 2.8 and 14.8 per million children). The mean incidence of antibody-positive autoimmune myasthenia was 1.5 per million children per year over the period of the study. Girls were affected more frequently than boys; this difference persisted across the age range. Antibodies were identified during the neonatal period in 17 children.This laboratory based study shows that childhood myasthenia is very rare. This condition is treatable, and these definitive detected incidence and prevalence data can be used to help plan diagnostic and supporting services for affected children and their families, and maximise research opportunities."
25976171,"A recent international study reported a higher prevalence of oesophageal atresia with or without tracheo-oesophageal fistula (OA±TOF) in Western Australia (WA). The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence and trends of OA and/or TOF in WA, determine the proportion of cases with associated anomalies and explore the impact of time of diagnosis.The study population comprised all infants born in WA, 1980-2009, and registered with OA and/or TOF on the WA Register of Developmental Anomalies (WARDA).OA±TOF and TOF alone affect, on average, one in every 2927 births in WA, with a total prevalence of 3.00 and 0.42 per 10 000 births, respectively. The prevalence of OA±TOF increased by 2.0% per annum, with only cases with associated anomalies (64% of cases) demonstrating an increase. TOF rates were stable. Among OA±TOF infants, the proportion of live births, stillbirths and elective terminations of pregnancy for fetal anomaly (TOPFA) was 79%, 6% and 15%, respectively, whereas the majority (94%) of TOF only cases were live births. In 2000-2009, there was 30% fall in OA±TOF live births with 61 (58%) cases diagnosed in first week of life, 10 (9%) prenatally and 34 (32%) at post-mortem only.A higher prevalence of OA±TOF in WA was observed with increase over time attributable to increase with associated anomalies. Consistent reporting, availability of prenatal diagnosis and ascertainment of cases following TOPFA or post-mortem examinations can significantly affect prevalence of OA and/or TOF."
11112660,"Autosomal recessive Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) represents a heterogeneous group of disorders affecting the peripheral nervous system. The axonal form of the disease is designated as ""CMT type 2"" (CMT2), and one locus (1q21.2-q21.3) has been reported for the autosomal recessive form. Here we report the results of a genomewide search in an inbred Costa Rican family (CR-1) affected with autosomal recessive CMT2. By analyzing three branches of the family we detected linkage to the 19q13.3 region, and subsequent homozygosity mapping defined shared haplotypes between markers D19S902 and D19S907 in a 5.5-cM range. A maximum two-point LOD score of 9.08 was obtained for marker D19S867, at a recombination fraction of.00, which strongly supports linkage to this locus. The epithelial membrane protein 3 gene, encoding a PMP22 homologous protein and located on 19q13.3, was ruled out as being responsible for this form of CMT. The age at onset of chronic symmetric sensory-motor polyneuropathy was 28-42 years (mean 33.8 years); the electrophysiological data clearly reflect an axonal degenerative process. The phenotype and locus are different from those of demyelinating CMT4F, recently mapped to 19q13.1-13.3; hence, the disease affecting the Costa Rican family constitutes an axonal, autosomal recessive CMT subtype (ARCMT2B)."
15481678,"The mean incidence of cystic fibrosis (CF) among North Americans of European ancestry is 1 in 2,500. Studies carried out in different geographic areas report incidence values ranging from 1 in 1,800 to 1 in 8,500, suggesting that incidence has to be assessed specifically for any population. This paper represents the first attempt to evaluate the incidence of CF in Italy and its time-related changes following the discovery of the gene in 1989. Data recorded in the Italian National CF Registry for CF subjects born between 1988 and 2001 were evaluated. All CF patients (1,742) were diagnosed by 1 of 18 specialized CF centers and 7 support services (1-3 in each region) according to the consensus statement on CF diagnosis. The average CF incidence in Italy was found to be 1 in 4,238, which is lower than the values reported elsewhere. The incidence remained nearly constant from 1988 to 2001, although the percentage of subjects screened for CF increased by 44%. Molecular analysis (available for more than 80% of the patients) indicated that the most common mutation (DF508) in Italy occurs in only 49% of CF chromosomes; the other mutations differ from region to region. These differences appeared to be mildly related to differences in reason for diagnosis and type of mutation. Italian registry data supply an incidence of CF lower than that reported for populations of European descent. Part of this difference is probably due to the higher allelic heterogeneity of the CFTR gene in Italy with respect to Northern Europe or the U.S. population of European descent."
21729823,"BACKGROUND: Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare malignancy of the skin, and its incidence is reported to be rising. The purpose of this study was to calculate its incidence and survival ratios, and to describe the clinical characteristics of Merkel cell carcinoma patients in Finland. METHODS: We calculated the incidence of MCC based on data from the Finnish Cancer Registry. In addition, patient files from hospitals and primary health care centres were reviewed for detailed data on the treatment and disease recurrence of 181 patients diagnosed with MCC in Finland during 1983-2004, and relative survival ratios were calculated for them. RESULTS: The incidence (per 100,000) of MCC in Finland in 1989-2008 was 0.11 for men and 0.12 for women, adjusted for age to the world standard population. The mean age at diagnosis was 76 years (range 27-100), and 69% of the patients were women. The most common site of the primary tumour was the head and neck (53%). No extra benefit was gained from a wide surgical margin (≥ 2 cm) compared to a margin of 0.1-0.19 cm, but an intralesional excision was more often associated with local recurrence. None of the patients with Stage I-II disease who had received postoperative radiotherapy to the tumour bed had a local recurrence. The 5-year relative survival ratio amongst men was 36% (95% confidence interval 20-54%), and amongst women 69% (56 to -82%). CONCLUSIONS: MCC is a rare disease in Finland, with incidence rates similar to those in the other Nordic countries. Our results support the view that complete excision with clear margins and post operative radiotherapy decrease local recurrences."
15168377,"BACKGROUND:Nondiarrheal or Streptococcus pneumoniae-related hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) represents a heterogeneous group of disorders. This study was performed to: (1) describe the current incidence, causes, demographic features, hospital courses, and short-term outcomes of non-enteropathic HUS; (2) compare findings in patients with non-enteropathic HUS with those obtained from a contemporaneous cohort of children with enteropathic or diarrhea-associated HUS (D+ HUS) diagnosed and treated at the same clinical sites; and (3) identify clinical or laboratory features that differentiate these 2 groups and predict disease severity and the short-term outcome in patients with non-enteropathic HUS. METHODS:Data were collected from patients screened between 1997 and 2001 for enrollment in a multicenter trial of SYNSORB Pk (SYNSORB Biotech Inc, Calgary, Alberta, Canada) in D+ HUS, but who were ineligible because of lack of a diarrhea prodrome. The following features were recorded: age; sex; ethnicity; prodromal symptoms; cause; nadir values for hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet count; use of dialysis; and length of hospitalization. RESULTS:Twenty-seven of 247 children with HUS had non-enteropathic HUS (11%). Twenty-four patients (15 boys, 9 girls), whose medical records were complete and available for review, comprise the study cohort. Mean age at onset was 4.2 +/- 0.9 (SE) years. Infection caused by S pneumoniae was diagnosed in 9 patients (38%). Dialysis was performed in 17 patients (71%) for 40 +/- 27 days. Median length of hospitalization was 22 days (range, 2 to 71 days). Children with S pneumoniae-related HUS had a longer hospital stay than those with other causes of non-enteropathic HUS, but all patients with S pneumoniae-related HUS recovered kidney function. Dialysis therapy was required more often (17 of 24 versus 59 of 145 children; P = 0.025) and hospital stays were longer (median, 22 versus 9 days; P = 0.002) in children with non-enteropathic HUS compared with patients with D+ HUS who were enrolled in the SYNSORB Pk clinical trial. CONCLUSION:(1) The incidence of non-enteropathic HUS is approximately one tenth that of D+ HUS; (2) patients with non-enteropathic HUS require dialysis therapy more often and are hospitalized more than twice as long during the acute episode compared with those with D+ HUS; (3) infection caused by S pneumoniae accounts for nearly 40% of cases of non-enteropathic HUS; and (4) although S pneumoniae-related HUS is associated with a less favorable short-term course than other types of non-enteropathic HUS or D+ HUS, the long-term prognosis for recovery of renal function appears to be good in these patients."
15522956,"Fanconi anemia (FA) is a genetic disease characterized by bone marrow failure and cancer predisposition. Here we have identified Spanish Gypsies as the ethnic group with the world's highest prevalence of FA (carrier frequency of 1/64-1/70). DNA sequencing of the FANCA gene in 8 unrelated Spanish Gypsy FA families after retroviral subtyping revealed a homozygous FANCA mutation (295C>T) leading to FANCA truncation and FA pathway disruption. This mutation appeared specific for Spanish Gypsies as it is not found in other Gypsy patients with FA from Hungary, Germany, Slovakia, and Ireland. Haplotype analysis showed that Spanish Gypsy patients all share the same haplotype. Our data thus suggest that the high incidence of FA among Spanish Gypsies is due to an ancestral founder mutation in FANCA that originated in Spain less than 600 years ago. The high carrier frequency makes the Spanish Gypsies a population model to study FA heterozygote mutations in cancer."
21500142,"Short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (SCADD) is an autosomal recessive inborn error of metabolism, most frequently associated with developmental delay and/or epilepsy. Most SCADD patients carry common SCAD-encoding gene ( ACADS) variants or these variants in combination with a rare ACADS mutation, in the Netherlands predominantly the c.1058C>T. Epilepsy in childhood often remains unexplained and patients with epilepsy related to SCADD may remain undiagnosed because studies for SCADD are often not performed. To test this hypothesis and to further estimate the extent of the Dutch SCADD population, we performed a study on blood spot samples in 131 paediatric patients with epilepsy and 909 anonymous newborns and investigated the presence of the 2 common ACADS variants and the rare c.1058C>T mutation. Overall, the 2 common ACADS variants and the rare c.1058C>T mutation were detected in either homozygous or compound heterozygous forms in 9.2% of the epilepsy and 7.5% of the reference group. A birth prevalence of SCADD with a mutation/variant genotype in the Netherlands as high as >1:1,000 was calculated. This is in contrast with the low number of patients diagnosed clinically and supports the hypothesis that SCADD is clinically irrelevant. Furthermore our study does not support an association between SCADD and epilepsy."
26537434,"The first mutations identified in SLC2A1, encoding the glucose transporter type 1 (GLUT1) protein of the blood-brain barrier, were associated with severe epileptic encephalopathy. Recently, dominant SLC2A1 mutations were found in rare autosomal dominant families with various forms of epilepsy including early onset absence epilepsy (EOAE), myoclonic astatic epilepsy (MAE), and genetic generalized epilepsy (GGE). Our study aimed to investigate the possible role of SLC2A1 in various forms of epilepsy including MAE and absence epilepsy with early onset. We also aimed to estimate the frequency of GLUT1 deficiency syndrome in the Danish population. One hundred twenty patients with MAE, 50 patients with absence epilepsy, and 37 patients with unselected epilepsies, intellectual disability (ID), and/or various movement disorders were screened for mutations in SLC2A1. Mutations in SLC2A1 were detected in 5 (10%) of 50 patients with absence epilepsy, and in one (2.7%) of 37 patient with unselected epilepsies, ID, and/or various movement disorders. None of the 120 MAE patients harbored SLC2A1 mutations. We estimated the frequency of SLC2A1 mutations in the Danish population to be approximately 1:83,000. Our study confirmed the role of SLC2A1 mutations in absence epilepsy with early onset. However, our study failed to support the notion that SLC2A1 aberrations are a cause of MAE without associated features such as movement disorders."
24560699,"Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis (AAV), including granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), and Churg-Strauss syndrome (CSS), comprises a group of diseases with significant morbidity and mortality. The incidence and relative frequency of GPA/MPA/CSS are different all over the world. The epidemiology of AAV in Taiwan is still not clear.The current study aimed to provide a population-based estimate of the annual incidence of GPA using the Taiwan National Health Insurance (NHI) research database and a single hospital-based estimate of the relative frequency of AAV in Taiwan.The annual incidence of GPA in Taiwan was 0.37 per million patient-years (95% Poisson rate confidence interval: 0.30-0.45) from 1997 to 2008, according to the NHI database. In our hospital, 24 patients were newly diagnosed with AAV between 2003 and 2011, including eight patients with GPA, 14 with MPA, and two with CSS. The ratio of the number of patients with GPA to that of MPA was 0.57.The current results provide an estimate of the annual incidence of GPA and the relative frequency of AAV in the Chinese Han community in Taiwan. Such geoepidemiology information may help illuminate the interaction between ethnic background and environment in these autoimmune diseases."
23873811,"BACKGROUND: Neural tube defects are one of the most prevalent congenital anomalies. Data on the total birth prevalence, live birth and stillbirth prevalence of neural tube defects in India are lacking. The objective of this study is to conduct a systematic review of birth prevalence of neural tube defects in India and compare it with existing estimates. METHODS: A PubMed search identified 463 articles, of which 19 articles were eligible for inclusion in the review. Meta-analysis was used to estimate the overall birth prevalence of neural tube defects and to investigate the variation among studies identified by this review. RESULTS: The 19 articles reported a total of 308,387 births, among which 1310 cases of neural tube defects were reported, giving an overall birth prevalence of 4.1 per 1000 (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.1-5.4). The live birth and stillbirth prevalence of neural tube defects was 1.3 per 1000 births (95% CI, 0.9-1.8) and 1.7 per 1000 births (95% CI, 0.7-4.0), respectively. Among the neural tube defects, the reported prevalence of anencephaly was highest at 2.1 per 1000 births (95% CI, 1.6-2.8) followed by spina bifida at 1.9 per 1000 births (95% CI, 1.4-2.7). CONCLUSION: The systematic review suggests that neural tube defects contribute to a significant number of live births and stillbirths in India, suggesting that preconception folic acid supplementation should be an essential element of reproductive health services."
12084585,"This study was designed to determine the reasons for the variability of the incidence of congenital heart disease (CHD), estimate its true value and provide data about the incidence of specific major forms of CHD. The incidence of CHD in different studies varies from about 4/1,000 to 50/1,000 live births. The relative frequency of different major forms of CHD also differs greatly from study to study. In addition, another 20/1,000 live births have bicuspid aortic valves, isolated anomalous lobar pulmonary veins or a silent patent ductus arteriosus. The incidences reported in 62 studies published after 1955 were examined. Attention was paid to the ways in which the studies were conducted, with special reference to the increased use of echocardiography in the neonatal nursery. The total incidence of CHD was related to the relative frequency of ventricular septal defects (VSDs), the most common type of CHD. The incidences of individual major forms of CHD were determined from 44 studies. The incidence of CHD depends primarily on the number of small VSDs included in the series, and this number in turn depends upon how early the diagnosis is made. If major forms of CHD are stratified into trivial, moderate and severe categories, the variation in incidence depends mainly on the number of trivial lesions included. The incidence of moderate and severe forms of CHD is about 6/1,000 live births (19/1,000 live births if the potentially serious bicuspid aortic valve is included), and of all forms increases to 75/1,000 live births if tiny muscular VSDs present at birth and other trivial lesions are included. Given the causes of variation, there is no evidence for differences in incidence in different countries or times."

The source of cases was the material of the Hungarian Congenital Malformation Registry. Birth prevalence was 0.95/100,000 total births. 85% of all cases proved to be consequences of new mutations, hence the mutation rate was 4.07 x 10(-6) +/- 3.12 x 10(-6)."
22945024,"The prevalence of esophageal atresia (EA) has been shown to vary across different geographical settings. Investigation of geographical differences may provide an insight into the underlying etiology of EA.The study population comprised infants diagnosed with EA during 1998 to 2007 from 18 of the 46 birth defects surveillance programs, members of the International Clearinghouse for Birth Defects Surveillance and Research. Total prevalence per 10,000 births for EA was defined as the total number of cases in live births, stillbirths, and elective termination of pregnancy for fetal anomaly (ETOPFA) divided by the total number of all births in the population.Among the participating programs, a total of 2943 cases of EA were diagnosed with an average prevalence of 2.44 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.35-2.53) per 10,000 births, ranging between 1.77 and 3.68 per 10,000 births. Of all infants diagnosed with EA, 2761 (93.8%) were live births, 82 (2.8%) stillbirths, 89 (3.0%) ETOPFA, and 11 (0.4%) had unknown outcomes. The majority of cases (2020, 68.6%), had a reported EA with fistula, 749 (25.5%) were without fistula, and 174 (5.9%) were registered with an unspecified code.On average, EA affected 1 in 4099 births (95% CI, 1 in 3954-4251 births) with prevalence varying across different geographical settings, but relatively consistent over time and comparable between surveillance programs. Findings suggest that differences in the prevalence observed among programs are likely to be attributable to variability in population ethnic compositions or issues in reporting or registration procedures of EA, rather than a real risk occurrence difference.

27991707,"Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is potentially life threatening and typically occurs after an infection. No detailed information is available concerning the epidemiological characteristics of GBS in France. We estimated age- and sex-specific incidence rates (IRs) based on a French nationwide hospital discharge database. All patients hospitalized for GBS between 2008 and 2013 were identified by International Classification of Diseases-10 code G61.0 as principal diagnosis. Patients previously hospitalized for GBS in 2006 and 2007 were excluded. Sensitivity analyses were performed by considering alternative case definitions, based on more restrictive sets of codes. A total of 9,391 patients were identified, leading to an overall crude IR of 2.42 per 100,000 person-years (world standardized IR = 2.00). IRs increased with age, reaching a peak in the 70-79-year age group. IR was 46% higher in men than in women, and 44% higher in winter than in summer. In children, the highest IR was observed at the age of 2 years. These patterns were not modified by the use of alternative case definitions. This French nationwide study showed similar GBS epidemiological patterns in adults to those reported in other countries. We also report a childhood incidence peak around the age of 2 years, as previously observed in Latin American and Chinese populations."
6702974,"Between 1976 and 1980, medical and social service sources were used to ascertain cases of retinitis pigmentosa in Maine (1980 population, I, 124,660). As of July 1, 1980, 241 clinically prevalent cases of retinitis pigmentosa were ascertained. Extensive pedigrees were collected for 185 of the subjects and medical records were obtained. One hundred fourteen cases were further evaluated by clinical examination including electroretinography. Adjusting for incorrect diagnosis (eight of 114, 7%) and underascertainment (23 of 185, 12.5%), we estimated that prevalence of retinitis pigmentosa in Maine is 236 cases, 21 per 100,000 population or 1:4,756. Excluding Usher and Bardet-Biedl syndromes, the prevalence is 1:5,193. Estimated birth incidence of persons who will become affected with non-syndrome retinitis pigmentosa is 1:3,544. Incidence of newly diagnosed cases per year is about six per 1,000,000 population. Among kindreds, 16 of 85 (19%) were autosomal dominant, 55 of 85 (65%) autosomal recessive or isolated cases, seven of 85 (8%) X-linked recessive, and seven of 85 (8%) not classified by mode of transmission."

Human brucellosis surveillance is performed through mandatory notification and the national reference center.We report the results of human brucellosis surveillance from 2004 to 2013 with regards to epidemiological, clinical and microbiological data.A total of 250 cases were notified, making an annual incidence of 0.3 cases per million inhabitants. Brucella melitensis biovar 3 was the most frequently identified bacterium (79% of isolated strains). In total, 213 (85%) cases had been contaminated abroad in endemic countries. In 2012, an episode of re-emergence of brucellosis in cattle occurred in Haute-Savoie, in the French Alps, and was responsible for 2 human cases.Brucellosis has become a disease of travelers in France. However, maintaining a stringent epidemiological surveillance is necessary to be able to early detect any local re-emergence in humans or animals. The multidisciplinary surveillance was implemented in France years ago and is a successful example of the One Health Concept."
16359491,"The objective of this investigation was to describe the epidemiology of anotia and microtia with respect to various factors. The cases studied were all infants and fetuses with anotia or microtia identified by a population-based birth defects registry in Hawaii. The anotia and microtia rates were determined for selected factors and comparisons made among the subgroups by calculating the rate ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). A total of 120 cases were identified, for a rate of 3.79 per 10,000 live births. The anotia and microtia rate increased during 1986-2002, although the trend was not significant (P = 0.715). Of 49 specific structural birth defects examined, four were found to be significantly more common in the presence of anotia and microtia. When compared with Caucasians, the anotia and microtia rates were higher among Far East Asians (RR 1.79, 95% CI 0.89-3.68), Pacific Islanders (RR 2.26, 95% CI 1.24-4.32), and Filipinos (RR 2.34, 95% CI 1.23-4.64). The defects were less common among females (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.43-0.93) and more common with multiple birth (RR 3.72, 95% CI 1.66-7.33), birth weight < 2500 g (RR 3.35, 95% CI 2.04-5.30), and gestational age <38 weeks (RR 2.27, 95% CI 1.49-3.40). In conclusion, the rate for anotia and microtia increased in Hawaii during the study period. The rates for only a few structural birth defects were substantially greater than expected in association with anotia and microtia. Anotia and microtia rates varied significantly according to maternal race/ethnicity, infant sex, plurality, birth weight, and gestational age."

Responses were received from 86% of surveyed organisations, and an estimated 45% of all ENT consultants in UK. The estimated number of recurrent respiratory papillomatosis patients from the cross-sectional survey was 918 (at August 2015) which included 730 patients in England. The number of recurrent respiratory papillomatosis patients in England estimated from Hospital Episode Statistics (2014/15 financial year) was up to 741. A total of 42 Coblation procedures conducted in the UK were identified from the cross-sectional survey; 36 were conducted in England compared with 34 identified from Hospital Episode Statistics.The numbers of recurrent respiratory papillomatosis patients and Coblation procedures identified in England from a cross-sectional survey and Hospital Episode Statistics were in broad agreement. Our study estimated 1.42 recurrent respiratory papillomatosis patients per 100 000 in the general UK population. We also estimated that Coblation procedures accounted for 3% of interventional treatments conducted in the UK recurrent respiratory papillomatosis population."
28056392,"Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are emerging disorders of the elderly with an increasing burden on healthcare systems. He we report on the first population-based, epidemiological analysis of patients diagnosed with MDS in Switzerland between 2001 and 2012. The aim of this study was to characterize the extent and limitations of currently available population-based, epidemiological data and formulate recommendations for future health services research. The investigated outcomes comprised trends of annual case frequency, classification of morphological subtypes, incidence, mortality and survival. Annual case frequency increased by 20% (from 263 to 315 cases per year), whereas age-standardized incidence-/mortality-rates remained stable (2.5/1.1 per 100'000 person-years). This observation reflects population growth as well as higher diagnostic awareness and not an increase of age-specific risk. However, it will inevitably influence the future prevalence of MDS and the impact on healthcare systems. Reporting of classification in MDS subtypes was poor with modest improvement from 20% to 39% and increased awareness for mainly higher-risk diseases. Relative survival for all patients at 5-years (RS) ranged between 37 and 40%. Significant better RS was found for younger compared to older higher-risk MDS patients (48% vs. 17%), reflecting the effect of allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. However, no survival advantage was found in elderly patients after introduction of hypomethylating agents as standard for care in this patient group. Our data is in line with results from other MDS and cancer registries. It allows formulating recommendations for future collaborative health services research on MDS patients with national and international partners."
16919772,"The Automated Childhood Cancer Information System (ACCIS) collects and presents data on childhood cancer in Europe. This report describes trends (1978-1997) and geographical differences (1988-1997) in incidence and survival for 6202 children with neuroblastoma from 59 registries in 19 countries, grouped into five regions (British Isles, West, East, North, and South). The age-standardised incidence rate (ASR) of neuroblastoma in Europe in 1988-1997 was 10.9 cases per million children, being highest in infants (52.6). The ASR of neuroblastoma increased in Europe from 8.4 in 1978-1982 to 11.6 in 1993-1997, mostly due to an increase in infants (from 35.4 to 57.8). Overall 5-year survival was 59%, ranging from 47% (East) to 67% (West). It improved markedly from 37% in 1978-1982 to 66% in 1993-1997, especially in infants. A certain amount of overdiagnosis in children under 2 years of age may explain the increased incidence rates and partially the increase in survival. Survival of older children (aged 2-14 years), which is likely to be largely affected by therapy, has also improved from 21% to 45%."
23432451,"OBJECT: There are a variety of treatment options for the management of vestibular schwannomas (VSs), including microsurgical resection, radiotherapy, and observation. Although the choice of treatment is dependent on various patient factors, physician bias has been shown to significantly affect treatment choice for VS. In this study the authors describe the current epidemiology of VS and treatment trends in the US in the modern era. They also illustrate patient and tumor characteristics and elucidate their effect on tumor management. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with VS were identified through the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database, spanning the years 2004-2009. Age-adjusted incidence rates were calculated and adjusted using the 2000 US standard population. The chi-square and Student t-tests were used to evaluate differences between patient and tumor characteristics. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to determine the effects of various patient and tumor characteristics on the choice of tumor treatment. RESULTS: A total of 6225 patients with VSs treated between 2004 and 2009 were identified. The overall incidence rate was 1.2 per 100,000 population per year. The median age of patients with VS was 55 years, with the majority of patients being Caucasian (83.16%). Of all patients, 3053 (49.04%) received surgery only, with 1466 (23.55%) receiving radiotherapy alone. Both surgery and radiation were only used in 123 patients (1.98%), with 1504 patients not undergoing any treatment (24.16%). Increasing age correlated with decreased use of surgery (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.95-0.96; p<0.0001), whereas increasing tumor size was associated with the increased use of surgery (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.04-1.05; p<0.0001). Older age was associated with an increased likelihood of conservative management (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.04-1.05; p<0.0001). Racial disparities were also seen, with African American patients being significantly less likely to receive surgical treatment compared with Caucasians (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.35-0.70; p<0.0001), despite having larger tumors at diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of vestibular schwannomas in the US is 1.2 per 100,000 population per year. Although many studies have demonstrated improved outcomes with the use of radiotherapy for small- to medium-sized VSs, surgery is still the most commonly used treatment modality for these tumors. Racial disparities also exist in the treatment of VSs, with African American patients being half as likely to receive surgery and nearly twice as likely to have their VSs managed conservatively despite presenting with larger tumors. Further studies are needed to elucidate the reasons for treatment disparities and investigate the nationwide trend of resection for the treatment of small VSs."
10844935,"A registry of United States residents with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) was established in 1993 in order to estimate the minimum incidence of this uncommon primary immunodeficiency disease and characterize its epidemiologic and clinical features. To date, 368 patients have been registered; 259 have the X-linked recessive form of CGD, 81 have 1 of the autosomal recessive forms, and in 28 the mode of inheritance is unknown. The minimum estimate of birth rate is between 1/200,000 and 1/250,000 live births for the period 1980-1989. Pneumonia was the most prevalent infection (79% of patients; Aspergillus most prevalent cause), followed by suppurative adenitis (53% of patients; Staphylococcus most prevalent cause), subcutaneous abscess (42% of patients; Staphylococcus most prevalent cause), liver abscess (27% of patients; Staphylococcus most prevalent cause), osteomyelitis (25% of patients; Serratia most prevalent cause), and sepsis (18% of patients; Salmonella most prevalent cause). Fifteen percent of patients had gastric outlet obstruction, 10% urinary tract obstruction, and 17% colitis/enteritis. Ten percent of X-linked recessive kindreds and 3% of autosomal recessive kindreds had family members with lupus. Eighteen percent of patients either were deceased when registered or died after being registered. The most common causes of death were pneumonia and/or sepsis due to Aspergillus (23 patients) or Burkholderia cepacia (12 patients). Patients with the X-linked recessive form of the disease appear to have a more serious clinical phenotype than patients with the autosomal recessive forms of the disease, based on the fact that they are diagnosed significantly earlier (mean, 3.01 years of age versus 7.81 years of age, respectively), have a significantly higher prevalence of perirectal abscess (17% versus 7%), suppurative adenitis (59% versus 32%), bacteremia/fungemia (21% versus 10%), gastric obstruction (19% versus 5%), and urinary tract obstruction (11% versus 3%), and a higher mortality (21.2% versus 8.6%)."
24505122,"OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to describe the clinical features of periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis and cervical adenitis (PFAPA) and identify distinct phenotypes in a large cohort of patients from different countries. METHODS: We established a web-based multicentre cohort through an international collaboration within the periodic fevers working party of the Pediatric Rheumatology European Society (PReS). The inclusion criterion was a diagnosis of PFAPA given by an experienced paediatric rheumatologist participating in an international working group on periodic fever syndromes. RESULTS: Of the 301 patients included from the 15 centres, 271 had pharyngitis, 236 cervical adenitis, 171 oral aphthosis and 132 with all three clinical features. A total of 228 patients presented with additional symptoms (131 gastrointestinal symptoms, 86 arthralgias and/or myalgias, 36 skin rashes, 8 neurological symptoms). Thirty-one patients had disease onset after 5 years and they reported more additional symptoms. A positive family history for recurrent fever or recurrent tonsillitis was found in 81 patients (26.9%). Genetic testing for monogenic periodic fever syndromes was performed on 111 patients, who reported fewer occurrences of oral aphthosis or additional symptoms. Twenty-four patients reported symptoms (oral aphthosis and malaise) outside the flares. The CRP was >50 mg/l in the majority (131/190) of the patients tested during the fever. CONCLUSION: We describe the largest cohort of PFAPA patients presented so far. We confirm that PFAPA may present with varied clinical manifestations and we show the limitations of the commonly used diagnostic criteria. Based on detailed analysis of this cohort, a consensus definition of PFAPA with better-defined criteria should be proposed."
22033323,"Epidemiologic information on rare cancers is scarce. The project Surveillance of Rare Cancers in Europe (RARECARE) provides estimates of the incidence, prevalence and survival of rare cancers in Europe based on a new and comprehensive list of these diseases.RARECARE analysed population-based cancer registry (CR) data on European patients diagnosed from 1988 to 2002, with vital status information available up to 31st December 2003 (latest date for which most CRs had verified data). The mean population covered was about 162,000,000. Cancer incidence and survival rates for 1995-2002 and prevalence at 1st January 2003 were estimated.Based on the RARECARE definition (incidence <6/100,000/year), the estimated annual incidence rate of all rare cancers in Europe was about 108 per 100,000, corresponding to 541,000 new diagnoses annually or 22% of all cancer diagnoses. Five-year relative survival was on average worse for rare cancers (47%) than common cancers (65%). About 4,300,000 patients are living today in the European Union with a diagnosis of a rare cancer, 24% of the total cancer prevalence.Our estimates of the rare cancer burden in Europe provide the first indication of the size of the public health problem due to these diseases and constitute a useful base for further research. Centres of excellence for rare cancers or groups of rare cancers could provide the necessary organisational structure and critical mass for carrying out clinical trials and developing alternative approaches to clinical experimentation for these cancers."

METHODS: Retrospective case series and patient questionnaire of 190 microtia patients referred for reconstruction of the earlobe to the Helsinki University Central Hospital during the years 1980-2005. RESULTS: The prevalence in Finland is 4.34/10,000 and varied in other populations from 0.83 to 17.4/10,000. Microtia is seen more in males (58%), as unilateral (88.4%), right-sided (59.5%) and it is almost always associated with aural atresia or stenosis (93%). There is conductive hearing loss in 96% and sensorineural hearing loss in 8% of the affected ears. 11% of the patients had congenital heart defects, and 5% had anomalies of extremities. CONCLUSIONS: There is variation in the prevalence and characteristics of microtia in different populations."
25774057,"To study the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of Takayasu arteritis (TA) in southern Sweden.The study area is situated in Skåne, the southernmost county in Sweden (total population December 2011: 983,419, 50.5% women). Patients were identified using clinical registries in all the 5 hospitals and private rheumatology clinics within the study area between the years 1997 and 2011. The diagnosis of TA was confirmed by medical records review. Only patients fulfilling the 1990 American College of Rheumatology classification criteria were included.Thirteen patients (all women) were identified. The median age at diagnosis was 23 years [interquartile range (IQR) 16-38]. Ten patients were diagnosed between 1997 and 2011. The annual incidence rate was estimated to 0.7/million inhabitants (95% CI 0.3-1.2) and 1.5/million among women (95% CI 0.6-2.4). Patients were followed for a median of 9 years (IQR 4-17.5). As of January 1, 2012, all 13 patients were alive and living within the study area. The point prevalence per million inhabitants was 13.2 (95% CI 6.0-20.4), and 26.2 among women (95% CI 11.9-40.4). Subclavian arteries were the most commonly affected vessels. Organ damage was common, affecting all patients. Seven pregnancies resulting in 5 live births and 2 abortions were registered after the diagnosis of TA.The incidence of TA in Sweden is comparable to recently reported rates from other European studies, while the prevalence is higher than previously reported. The prognosis of TA is good, but the rate of damage is high."
22357215,"Embryonal cancers are a heterogeneous group of rare cancers which mainly occur in children and adolescents. The aim of the present study was to estimate the burden (incidence, prevalence, survival and proportion of cured) for the principal embryonal cancers in Europe (EU27), using population-based data from cancer registries (CRs) participating in RARECARE. We identified 3322 cases diagnosed from 1995 to 2002 (latest period for which data are available): 44% neuroblastoma, 35% nephroblastoma, 13% retinoblastoma and 6% hepatoblastoma. Very few cases of pulmonary blastoma (43 cases) and pancreatoblastoma (seven cases) were diagnosed. About 2000 new embryonal cancers were estimated every year in EU27, for an annual incidence rate of 4 per million (1.8 neuroblastoma, 1.4 nephroblastoma, and 0.5 retinoblastoma); 91% of cases occurred in patients under 15 years. Five-year relative survival for all embryonal cancers was 80% (99% retinoblastoma, 90% nephroblastoma, 71% hepatoblastoma and 68% neuroblastoma). Overall survival was lower in adolescents and adults than in those under 15 years. The cure rate was estimated at 80%. Slightly less than 40,000 persons were estimated alive in EU27 with a diagnosis of embryonal cancer in 2008. Nephroblastoma was the most prevalent (18,150 cases in EU27), followed by neuroblastoma (12,100), retinoblastoma (5200), hepatoblastoma (2700) and pulmonary blastoma (614). This is the first study to delineate the embryonal cancer burden in Europe by age, sex and European region. Survival/cure rate is generally high, but there are considerable gaps in our understanding of the natural histories of these rare diseases particularly in adults."
8876090,"OBJECTIVES:Analysis of incidence and characteristics of congenital abdominal wall defects, with special reference to the differences between the incidence of gastroschisis and exomphalos (omphalocele). DESIGN:Retrospective analysis using data from the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys (recoded to differentiate exomphalos and gastroschisis) and the National Congenital Malformation Notification Scheme. SETTING:England and Wales, 1987 to 1993. RESULTS:1043 congenital anterior abdominal wall defects were notified within the seven year study period. Of these, 539 were classified as gastroschisis, 448 as exomphalos, 19 as ""prune belly syndrome,"" and 37 as ""unclassified."" Gastroschisis doubled in incidence from 0.65 in 1987 to 1.35 per 10,000 total births in 1991, with little further change; the incidence of exomphalos decreased from 1.13 to 0.77 per 10000 births. The overall incidence of notified congenital abdominal wall defects was 2.15 per 10000 total births. Gastroschisis was associated with a lower overall maternal age than exomphalos and with a significantly lower proportion of additional reported congenital malformations (5.0%) than in the cohort with exomphalos (27.4%) (odds ratio 0.14, 95% confidence interval 0.09 to 0.22; P < 0.001). The sex ratio of the two cohorts was the same. The incidence of gastroschisis and exomphalos was higher in the northern regions of England than in the south east of the country. CONCLUSIONS:The national congenital malformation notification system showed an increasing trend in the incidence of fetuses born with gastroschisis and a progressive decreasing incidence of exomphalos in England and Wales between 1987 and 1993. Although the reasons for this are likely to be multifactorial, a true differential change seems likely. The observed increase in incidence of gastroschisis relative to exomphalos and the differentiation in maternal age have implications for resource management within the NHS and warrant further epidemiological monitoring. Regional differences may be due to a dietary or environmental factor, which requires further study."
19224791,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this article is to summarize all episodes of local anesthetic-related methemoglobinemia found in the medical literature. METHODS: I performed a search of the American National Library of Medicine's PubMed with the following key words: ""local anesthetic"" and ""methemoglobinemia."" RESULTS: Two-hundred-forty-two episodes (40.1% published in year 2000 or after) were found. Chocolate-colored blood suggests methemoglobinemia but other colors may be found. A discrepancy between the pulse oximeter saturation (< or = 90%) and the arterial oxygen partial pressure (> or = 70 mm Hg) was present in 91.8% of the episodes. The difference between oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry and co-oximetry varied from -6.2% to 44.7%. Plain prilocaine may induce clinically symptomatic methemoglobinemia in children older than 6 mo at doses exceeding 2.5 mg/kg. In adults, the dose of prilocaine should be kept lower than 5.0 mg/kg, which is reduced to 3.2 mg/kg in the presence of renal insufficiency and to 1.3 mg/kg if other oxidizing drugs are used concurrently. A single spray of benzocaine may induce methemoglobinemia. Clinical symptoms may be observed at relatively low methemoglobin values, including coma at 32.2 and 29.1% in children and adults, respectively. Rebound methemoglobinemia (benzocaine on mucous membranes) with methemoglobin values as high as 59.9% may occur up to 18 h after methylene blue administration. Complications of methemoglobinemia include hypoxic encephalopathy, myocardial infarction, and death. CONCLUSION: Benzocaine should no longer be used. Prilocaine should not be used in children younger than 6-mo-old, in pregnant women, or in patients taking other oxidizing drugs. The dose should be limited to 2.5 mg/kg."
11319059,"The incidence and prevalence of achalasia has been reported from a limited number of centers in the US, UK, Israel, Zimbabwe, Singapore, and New Zealand. With two exceptions, the studies have been retrospective. The incidence of the disease is about 0.5/10(5)/year with a prevalence of about 8/10(5) population. However, there appear to be striking international variations and also significant differences within countries. The disease occurs with equal frequency in men and women and is commoner with ageing. The appearance of the disease in the older age groups together with the lack of evidence for an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance would suggest that environmental factors are important in the cause of the disease."
25804189,"Whipple's disease (WD) is a rare systemic infection due, in genetically susceptible individuals, to Tropheryma whipplei, a heterogeneous Gram-positive actinobacteria. Although it has already been recognised that WD affects mainly middle-aged Caucasian men, the prevalence of WD is virtually unknown. The annual incidence of WD in the general population is said to be less than 1 per 1,000,000, but scientific evidence for these figures is still lacking. On the basis of the number of patients recorded with a diagnosis of Whipple's disease in the regional registers for rare diseases of Lombardia, Liguria and Piemonte-Valle d'Aosta regions, we studied the prevalence of WD in the north-western part of Italy. Forty-six patients with Whipple's disease were recorded in these regions (13 females; mean age at diagnosis 52.1 ± 11.1 years). Since 16,130,725 inhabitants live in these four regions, prevalence of WD in the general population is 3/10(6) and almost 30% of the patients are females. WD is certainly a rare disease but it also affects women in a considerable proportion of cases."
28180235,"Little information is available on the incidence of splanchnic vein thrombosis and on mortality rates during the acute phase of the disease. We performed a large epidemiologic study on hospital admissions for portal vein thrombosis (PVT) and the Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) between 2002 and 2012 in Northwestern Italy. Primary and secondary discharge diagnoses of PVT and BCS were identified using the 9th edition International Classification of Diseases codes 453.0, 572.1 and 452. Hospitalisations for recurrent events were not included. Information was collected on age and gender, vital status at discharge, duration of hospitalisation, and up to five secondary discharge diagnoses. Comorbidity was evaluated using the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI). A total of 3535 patients with PVT and 287 with BCS were hospitalized. The overall gender-specific incidence rates for PVT were 3.78 per 100,000 inhabitants in males and 1.73 per 100,000 inhabitants in females; for BCS 2.0 and 2.2 per million inhabitants, respectively. In-hospital case fatality was 7.3 % in patients with PVT and 4.9 % in patients with BCS. Age, non-abdominal solid cancer, and CCI were independently associated with in-hospital mortality in both PVT and BCS after stepwise regression analysis, male gender and haematologic cancer were associated with mortality in BCS patients only. In this large study we confirmed the low incidence of BCS and we found an incidence of PVT higher than previously reported. This incidence was stable during the period of observation. In-hospital mortality is not negligible, in particular in PVT patients."
25120049,"Castleman disease (CD) is a rare lymphoproliferative disorder affecting single (unicentric; UCD) or multiple (multicentric; MCD) lymph nodes. The incidence of this difficult to diagnose disease is poorly understood, as no International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) code is available. This study utilized a unique strategy to estimate its incidence using two commercial claims databases, IMS LifeLink™ and Truven Health Analytics MarketScan(®). Patients with an index diagnosis of lymphadenopathy (ICD-9 code 785.6) were followed longitudinally for 1 year prior to and 2 years post-index diagnosis date. An algorithm that identifies potential patients with CD was developed to determine the incidence rate in person-years. The incidence rate for CD was calculated as 21 (IMS LifeLink™) and 25 (MarketScan(®)) per million person-years. Additionally, 23% of patients with CD were identified as potentially suffering from MCD. These results are consistent with the definition of an orphan disease, and the low incidence of the disease estimated in the literature."
17044834,"OBJECTIVES: Few population-based data exist on the incidence and prognosis of hairy cell leukemia (HCL). Our objectives were to study the effect of socio-demographic factors on this rare disease and the risk of second malignancies occurring in HCL patients. METHODS: We measured crude and age-adjusted incidence rates of HCL based on reporting to the Israel Cancer Registry (ICR) 1991-2001. Using Kaplan-Meier and multivariate analysis, we assessed survival by gender, ethnicity and geographic region. We ascertained additional primary tumors reported in this population and calculated standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for tumors reported after the diagnosis of HCL. RESULTS: The ICR registered 147 cases of HCL among males and 34 in females between 1991 and 2001. Age-adjusted incidence rates were 1.62/10(6)/yr for women and 7.97/10(6)/yr for men, with rates 1.5 times higher in Jewish than in non-Jewish (mainly Arab) men. Mean overall survival also differed by ethnicity. In a multivariate model, increasing age at diagnosis (P < 0.001), as well as Arab origin (P = 0.008) were associated with poorer survival but gender did not significantly affect the survival after controlling for age and ethnicity. Other primary malignancies were reported in 20 (11%) individuals, with a predominance of genito-urinary tumors (65%) among males. Secondary genito-urinary tumors were significantly increased above the expected population rates (SIR 3.23, 95% confidence interval: 1.39-6.36, P = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: In the Israeli population, age and ethnicity were associated with prognosis of HCL. Variations in disease characteristics, stage of disease at diagnosis or differential access to treatment may contribute to these findings. Patients with HCL appear to be at increased risk for genito-urinary malignancies."
12207153,"We identify the prevalence and genetic features of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) in Yonago and Sakaiminato, western Japan. From information in registered records and questionnaires, definite or candidate CMT patients were examined. Eleven families with 19 patients (7 female and 12 male) were identified and the prevalence was 10.8 per 100,000 in April 2000. Eleven patients in 6 families showed a Thr124Met mutation of the MPZ gene, in 2 families duplication of the PMP22 gene was suggested and no abnormalities were found in 2 families. To identify the occurrence of mildly affected CMT, the exhaustive region-matched and family study was necessary."
20546293,"AIMS: The aim of this study was to elucidate the entities and the frequency of neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM) in a large representative database for paediatric diabetes patients in Germany and Austria. METHODS: Based on the continuous diabetes data acquisition system for prospective surveillance (DPV), which includes 51,587 patients with onset of diabetes before the age of 18 years from 299 centres in Germany and Austria, we searched for patients with onset of diabetes mellitus in the first 6 months of life. RESULTS: Ninety patients were identified, comprising 0.17% of all paediatric cases in the DPV registry. This represented an incidence of approximately one case in 89,000 live births in Germany. A monogenic basis for NDM was established in 30 subjects (seven UPD6, 10 KCNJ11, seven ABCC8, two FOXP3, two PDX1, one INS, one EIF2AK3). Pancreatic hypoplasia or agenesis was reported in 10 patients and seven subjects were classified as having Type 1 diabetes by their centres. Transient neonatal diabetes (TNDM) accounted for approximately 10% of all cases with NDM. No aetiology was defined in 41 subjects, which may reflect incomplete genetic testing or novel genetic aetiologies. CONCLUSION: Based on a large database, we identified a higher rate of NDM in Germany than has been reported previously. Full molecular genetic testing should be performed in all patients diagnosed before 6 months of age."
24629043,"BACKGROUND: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a severe and progressive disease characterized by increased pulmonary vascular resistance, ultimately leading to right heart failure and death. Epidemiological data from national registries are growing worldwide, but are still unavailable in Eastern Europe. METHODS: A PAH registry was initiated in January 2007 using a nationwide network of echocardiographic centers and four diagnostic centers that specialize in PAH. All patients aged above 18 years, diagnosed with PAH and monitored between January 2000 and December 2007 were included. Patients diagnosed with PAH between January and December 2007 were classified as incident. The survival analyses were performed up to the end of 2010. Prognostic factors at the time of diagnosis were identified using uni- and multivariable Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS: Overall, 191 patients were included (100 prevalent cases, 91 incident cases). Patients were predominantly female (n = 125) and had a mean age of 51.9 ± 16.9 years. Incident patients were significantly older at the time of diagnosis than prevalent patients (p < 0.001). Most patients (60.7%) had idiopathic PAH; 20.4% had PAH associated with congenital heart disease and 11.4% had PAH associated with connective tissue disease. Estimates of prevalence and incidence of PAH in adults were 22.4 cases per million and 10.7 cases per million per year, respectively. The 1-, 2- and 3-year survival rates in the incident PAH cohort were 89% (95% confidence intervals [CI] 83-95%), 78% (95% CI 70-87%) and 74% (95% CI 65-83%), respectively. Lower survival rates were significantly associated with higher age (hazard ratio [HR] 6.6 95% CI 1.4-30.9) and lower creatinine clearance (HR 3.3 95% CI 1.1-9.7). CONCLUSION: This is the first study in Eastern Europe to describe the prevalence, incidence and survival of patients with PAH from a national representative registry. This registry from the Czech Republic highlights that diagnosis of PAH is frequently made late in the disease continuum when patients have significant functional impairment."
28775045,"The objective of the study was to estimate the prevalence and incidence of interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) in Seine-Saint-Denis, a multi-ethnic county of Greater Paris, France.Patients with ILDs were identified between January and December 2012 by using several sources; all potentially involved medical specialists from public and private hospitals, community-based pulmonologists and general practitioners, and the Social Security system. Diagnoses were validated centrally by an expert multidisciplinary discussion.1170 ILD cases were reported (crude overall prevalence: 97.9/105 and incidence: 19.4/105/year). In the 848 reviewed cases, the most prevalent diagnoses were sarcoidosis (42.6%), connective tissue diseases associated ILDs (CTDs-ILDs) (16%), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) (11.6%), and occupational ILDs (5.0%), which corresponded to a crude prevalence of 30.2/105 for sarcoidosis, 12.1/105 for CTDs-ILDs and 8.2/105 for IPF. The prevalence of fibrotic idiopathic interstitial pneumonias, merging IPF, nonspecific interstitial pneumonia and cases registered with code J84.1 was 16.34/105 An adjusted multinomial model demonstrated an increased risk of sarcoidosis in North Africans and Afro-Caribbeans and of CTDs-ILDs in Afro-Caribbeans, compared to that in Europeans.This study, with a comprehensive recruitment and stringent diagnostic criteria, emphasises the importance of secondary ILDs, particularly CTDs-ILDs and the relatively low prevalence of IPF, and confirms that sarcoidosis is a rare disease in France."
10587547,"OBJECTIVE:The aim of this work was to study changes in the incidence of biopsy-proven giant cell arteritis (GCA) over a period of 20 yr in Göteborg, Sweden. METHODS:All cases of biopsy-verified GCA between 1976 and 1995 were included in the study. The annual incidence was calculated for the whole material, for women and men separately, and its fluctuations were tested statistically. In addition, the monthly variation during the last 9 yr could be statistically analysed for the whole material. RESULTS:In total, 665 patients were diagnosed with biopsy-verified GCA during the 20 yr period. The average annual incidence was 22.2/100000 inhabitants over 50 yr of age (women 29.8, men 12.5). The annual incidence increased significantly with time (P<0.001) for both men and women. Statistical analysis did not reveal any cyclic fluctuation in the annual incidence (P=0.26), while the monthly number of positive biopsies showed significant fluctuation with peaks in late winter and autumn (P=0.041). CONCLUSIONS:The annual incidence of biopsy-positive GCA increased during the years 1976 through 1995. The significant seasonal variation, as well as considerable variation in annual incidence, might be due to the influence of exogenous triggering factors, such as infections. Further support for an exogenous aetiology, in terms of a statistically significant cyclic fluctuation of the annual incidence, was not found, however."
18410635,"There are no epidemiological studies from the British Isles of chronic granulomatous disease, characterized by recurrent, life-threatening bacterial and fungal infections and inflammatory sequelae. Patients were enrolled in a national registry and medical records were analysed. Of 94 subjects, 69 had X-linked disease, 16 had autosomal recessive disease and nine were unknown. Prevalence was 7.5/million for 1990-99 and 8.5/million for 1980-89. Suppurative adenitis, abscesses and pneumonia presented commonly. Twenty-three of 30 patients who underwent high resolution computerized tomography had chronic respiratory disease. Inflammatory sequelae included bowel stricture and urogenital tract granulomata. Growth failure was common; 75% of those measured were below the population mean. All patients received prophylactic antibiotics and 93% anti-fungal prophylaxis. Interferon gamma was used to treat infection, but rarely as prophylaxis. Despite prophylaxis, estimated survival was 88% at 10 years but 55% at age 30 years. Morbidity remains significant, severe infectious complications common. Curative treatments including stem cell transplantation should be considered for patients with frequent or serious complications."
17638728,"OBJECTIVE: To describe incidence trends for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) in the United States. DESIGN: Population-based study. SETTING: Data were obtained from 13 population-based cancer registries of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program of the National Cancer Institute from 1973 through 2002. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 4783 cases of CTCL were identified for the period 1973 through 2002. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Diagnosis of CTCL. RESULTS: The overall annual age-adjusted incidence of CTCL was 6.4 per million persons. Annual incidence increased by 2.9 x 10(-6) per decade over the study period. Incidence was higher among blacks (9.0 x 10(-6)) than among whites (6.1 x 10(-6)) and was higher among men (8.7 x 10(-6)) than among women (4.6 x 10(-6)). The racial differences in incidence decreased with age, while the sex differences increased with age and decreased over time. Substantial geographic variation in incidence was found. Incidence was correlated with high physician density, high family income, high percentage of population with a bachelor's degree or higher, and high home values. Changes in International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O) morphologic definitions have resulted in the redistribution of the cases of CTCL among specific subclassifications. CONCLUSIONS: The continued rise in incidence of CTCL is substantial, and the cause of this increase is unknown. The racial, ethnic, sex, and geographic differences in incidence may be of etiologic importance. Changes in ICD-O definitions have made it difficult to evaluate incidence trends for subclassifications of CTCL such as mycosis fungoides. In addition, these changes resulted in the creation of ambiguous histologic codes, which may have caused coding errors. These errors along with the lack of independent verification are limitations of our study. An epidemiological investigation using population-based data is important to better understand this disorder."
2054207,"The prevalence of several neurological diseases has been estimated in eighteen-year-old males living in the central provinces of the Iberian Peninsula (Avila, Badajoz, Caceres, Ciudad Real, Cuenca, Guadalajara, Madrid, Toledo and Segovia). To this end, the yearly recruitment census and the neurological evaluations in the recruits form each year between 1985 and 1989 were used. The yearly prevalence rates (per 10,0000) were evaluated for an overall population of 235,976 recruits. Particularly reliable and accurate, among the observed rates, were those related to epilepsy (513), multiple sclerosis (7.6), hereditary ataxias (10.6), neurological form of Wilson's disease (1.7), Tourette's disease (1.3), syringomyelia (0.9), focal neuropathies (74.6), diffuse neuropathies (17.8), myotonic dystrophy (5.5), congenital myotonia (4.7), myasthenia gravis (3.0), hypokalemic periodic paralysis (1.7), and myopathies as a whole (31.8). The possible usefulness to carry out studies with this outlook and the type of conditions more adequate for them are discussed."
11353947,"Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia is said to be an extremely rare condition but is clinically important because it can be confused with primary hyperparathyroidism. The biochemical features of the two conditions are similar, but the former is benign while the latter can have serious clinical consequences with patients occasionally proceeding to parathyroidectomy. It is therefore important to differentiate accurately between the two. With this in mind it would be useful to know the prevalence of familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia when considering the differential diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism. However, as far as we are aware, no estimate of the prevalence of this condition can be found in the literature. We describe how an estimate was made of the prevalence of familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia in the west of Scotland. We estimate the prevalence to be 1 in 78,000 at least."
21116729,"Achalasia is a rare esophageal motility disorder, incurable but amenable to palliative treatments to relieve dysphagia. Given the rarity of the disease, there is a paucity of data from population-based studies on incidence and outcome of the two treatments most commonly used in clinical practice, i.e., endoscopic pneumatic dilation (PD) and surgical myotomy (SM).A retrospective longitudinal study was conducted on the Veneto region, in north-eastern Italy. All patients with achalasia as their primary diagnosis between 2001 and 2005 were identified and their demographics and treatment details obtained.The overall incidence of achalasia was 1.59 cases/100,000/year. Achalasia patients were mainly seen at University Hospitals. Fifty-five percent of the patients received treatment, 23.3% SM and 31.8% PD. The cumulative risk of any subsequent intervention for achalasia was 20% in treated patients (29.7% in patients treated primarily with PD and 4% in patients treated with SM first).The epidemiology of achalasia in the Veneto Region is in line with the situation reported elsewhere and did not change between 2001 and 2005. Achalasia patients are mostly seen at University Hospitals. We observed a greater risk of subsequent intervention for patients previously treated with PD compared with SM."
20080524,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is among the most common lethal genetic diseases. It has been proposed that genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis have begun to lower the incidence. We reviewed the records of all patients with confirmed DMD who were born between 1969 and 2008. Statistics Canada data on annual male births in Nova Scotia were obtained for each year.The overall incidence of 1 per 4700 male births remained stable during the 30-year period of the study. Similarly, the age at diagnosis did not change during that time."
22939647,"OBJECTIVES: To assess overall and malformation-specific trends in the prevalence and prenatal diagnosis of congenital anomalies in the Parisian population. METHODS: The Paris Registry of Congenital Malformations is population-based and since 1981 has registered all cases with structural birth defects or chromosomal anomalies in the Parisian population. The total and livebirth prevalence and the proportion of cases with prenatal diagnosis were calculated for all anomalies and 20 malformations selected based on their higher frequency and their impact on health outcomes. RESULTS: The overall prevalence was 3.30% (95% CI 3.27-3.33), and the livebirth prevalence 2.42% (95% CI 2.39-2.45). The proportion of cases diagnosed prenatally increased from 16.5% (95% CI 14.1-19.1) in 1983 to 70.7% (95% CI 68.3-73.1) in 2007. Terminations of pregnancy for fetal anomaly (TOPFA) increased from 8.8% (95% CI 7.0-10.8) in 1983 to 35.6% (95% CI 33.1-38.1) in 2007. These results varied substantially for the 20 congenital anomalies studied. CONCLUSION: We found an increase in the overall prevalence of all anomalies, especially for chromosomal abnormalities. The observed increase is at least to a large extent due to trends in delayed childbearing and an increase in both pre- and postnatal diagnosis of congenital anomalies in our population."
10627940,"Using a birth defects registry, this study examined the influence of prenatal diagnosis and elective termination of pregnancy on trisomy 13 and trisomy 18 prevalence in Hawaii between 1986 and 1997. The investigation also evaluated the impact of various demographic factors on risk for the aneuploidies. Forty-seven cases of trisomy 13 and 116 cases of trisomy 18 were identified. The total prevalence of trisomy 13 was 1.91 per 10,000 births and of trisomy 18 was 4.71 per 10,000 births. Elective terminations accounted for 38.3% of trisomy 13 cases and 48.3% of trisomy 13 cases. The 1-year mortality rate for trisomy 13 was 89.5% and for trisomy 18 was 74.3%. Rates for both aneuploidies increased during the time period. The racial/ethnic group with the highest prevalence of both anomalies was Far East Asian. The aneuploidies were more common in metropolitan Honolulu than the rest of Hawaii. Demographic factors demonstrated differences in risk for trisomies 13 and 18, although most of these differences appeared to be due, at least in part, to differences in maternal age distribution. For the secular trend, increased prenatal diagnosis of the anomalies also contributed to the observed increase."
18223015,"To characterise the epidemiological features of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) in the Japanese population, this study performed a nationwide assessment of the prevalence and incidence rates in Japan.The prevalence rate per 100 000 was 1.61 in the total population; 2.01 in males and 1.23 in females. The age dependent prevalence rates were 0.23 in juveniles (<15 years old), 1.50 in young adults (15-55 years) and 2.31 in elderly adults (>55 years). The sex and age dependent prevalence rates were 0.22 in males and 0.24 in females in juveniles, 1.81 in males and 1.19 in females in young adults, and 3.12 in males and 1.64 in females in elderly adults. The annual incidence rate per 100 000 was 0.48 in the total population, 0.58 in males and 0.38 in females. The age dependent incidence rate was 0.06 in juveniles, 0.40 in young adults and 0.73 in elderly adults. The sex and age dependent incidence rate was 0.05 in males and 0.08 in females in juveniles, 0.50 in males and 0.30 in females in young adults, and 0.93 in males and 0.58 in females in elderly adults. Both the prevalence and incidence rates were very similar throughout the eight geographical areas studied, from the northern to the southern parts of Japan.The prevalence and incidence rates were similar to those reported in the Caucasian population. The pathogenic background is suggested to be common throughout the different races and geographic areas, while gender and age effects should be taken into account in the pathogenesis of CIDP."
18356259,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of vernal keratoconjuntivitis (VKC) in Europe. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was mailed to 3003 ophthalmologists from six countries (Finland, France, Italy, The Netherlands, Norway and Sweden) representing 151.9 million inhabitants. Results were analysed per country, and VKC prevalence for the 15 European member states in 2002 was extrapolated. Six hypotheses were used: disease duration (4 or 8 years) combined with three prevalence hypotheses for non-responding ophthalmologists. RESULTS: The response rate to the survey was 29.5%. The estimates of VKC prevalence in Western Europe (per 10,000 inhabitants) ranged from 1.16 to 10.55. The prevalence of VKC with corneal complications ranged from 0.30 to 2.26. The VKC prevalences per country were in the following ranges: Italy 2.4-27.8, Finland, 0.7-8.4, Sweden 1.2-8.7, The Netherlands 0.6-4.6, France 0.7-3.3 and Norway 0.3-1.9. VKC with corneal complications were: Italy 0.4-4.8, Sweden 0.3-2.4, Finland 0.2-2.8, The Netherlands 0.2-1.6, France 0.3-1.4 and Norway 0.1-1.0. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the most likely hypotheses concerning disease duration and non-responding ophthalmologists' VKC case rate, the best estimate of VKC prevalence in Western Europe is 3.2/10,000 inhabitants. The prevalence of VKC with corneal complications is 0.8/10,000 inhabitants."
23588513,"There has been no previous prevalence study about of Sjögren's syndrome (SS) in Brazil. The aim was to evaluate the SS prevalence in a general population in Vitória, ES, Brazil. This was an epidemiological, observational, and cross-sectional study conducted on 1,205 randomized people, aged 18-65 years, who lived in Vitória. The subjects were screened for xerostomia and xerofphthalmia through home interviews. Those with sicca symptoms were asked to report to a hospital for further medical evaluation, unstimulated salivary flow, Schirmer I test, blood analysis and minor labial salivary biopsy. Sicca symptoms were found in 18% (217 subjects) of the sample. Of the 217 subjects with sicca symptoms, 127 (58%) were available for examination. In this sample, 61.7% were female and 46.8% were under medication. Sicca syndrome was confirmed in 12% by at least one examination (salivary flow or Schirmer I). Two patients (0.17%) matched four criteria according to American-European Criteria (95% CI = 0.020-0.5983)."
10743812,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the frequency and clinical manifestations of Behçet's disease (BD) during the past 10 years in a defined area of Northwestern Spain. METHODS: The charts of all the patients diagnosed as having BD at the Hospital Xeral-Calde from 1988 through 1997 were reviewed. All the patients were residents of Lugo. Patients were followed from the time of diagnosis until either the patient's death or July 1, 1998. By that time patients were classified as having complete BD if they fulfilled the International Study Group Criteria (ISG) for BD. Patients with recurrent oral ulcerations plus one of the remaining 4 criteria of the ISG were classified as having an incomplete form of BD. RESULTS: Sixteen patients (9 men/7 women) were diagnosed as having complete BD and 7 (3 men) as having incomplete BD. The average annual incidence rate of complete BD in the Lugo region of Northwestern Spain was 0.66/100,000. Oral ulcerations with or without genital ulcerations were the most common initial manifestations. Neurological involvement was relatively frequent in men with complete BD. In contrast, a positive pathergy test was less common. Two patients with neurological involvement and 3 with uveitis had severe sequelae. However, there was a single death, apparently not related to BD. CONCLUSION: In Northwestern Spain, BD is more common than was expected and is a nonfatal disease. However, central nervous system involvement and severe ocular complications overshadow the good prognosis observed in the majority of patients."
23060475,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prevalence of congenital hypothyroidism (CH) among neonates in East Azerbaijan, Iran. METHODS: A cross-sectional study conducted from 2009 to 2010. Most heel blood samples were taken between three and seven days of birth. Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) was tested using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. Neonates with abnormal screening results (TSH>20 mIU/L, T4<6.5 mg/dL) were re-examined. Data were analysed using SPSS software. RESULTS: A total of 62,459 infants were screened. Of 1562 re-called subjects (re-call rate 2.5%), 94 cases with CH were detected, yielding a CH prevalence of 1:666 (female:male ratio 1:1.4). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of CH in East Azerbaijan province is higher in comparison with worldwide levels. These results emphasize the importance of the neonatal screening programme."
20665989,"Congenital dyserythropoietic anemias (CDAs) are rare hereditary disorders characterized by ineffective erythropoiesis and striking abnormalities of erythroblast morphology. The mutated genes are known for the most frequent types, CDA I and II, but data about their frequency do not exist. The objective of this retrospective study was to estimate the frequency of CDA I and II, based on all cases reported in the last 42 yr in publications and identified registries or surveys. Reports were collected of 124 and 377 confirmed cases of CDA I and CDA II cases, respectively. The cumulated incidence of both types combined varied widely between European regions, with minimal values of 0.08 cases/million in Scandinavia and 2.60 cases/million in Italy. CDA II is more frequent than CDA I, with an overall ratio of approximately 3.2, but the ratio also varied between different regions. The most likely explanations for the differences are both differences in the availability of advanced diagnostic procedures and different levels of the awareness for the diagnosis of the CDAs. The estimations reported here are most probably below the true incidence rates, because of failure to make the correct diagnosis and to underreporting. Limited data do not suggest differing levels of risk in identified ethnic groups."
17075524,"INTRODUCTION: The epidemiology of multifocal motor neuropathies (MMNs) is unknown. Prevalence is estimated at 1-2/100,000 population. METHODS: The objective of this study was to gain knowledge on MMN diagnosis and treatment in metropolitan France. An opinion survey was conducted by SOFRES from November 2004 to March 2005 on 4,040 hospital and private practice physicians (215 interviewed directly and 3,825 contacted only by mail) using two questionnaires (one for hospital physicians [HPs] and the other for physicians working for the most part in private practice [PPPs]). SOFRES received 424 questionnaires, 392 of which were included in the study, 32 having been excluded for incomplete responses, giving a high response rate for this type of survey. RESULTS: The 392 responses were made up of 296 for the HPs and 96 for the PPPs. The HPs were neurologists (56 percent), followed by internists (23 percent), and rheumatologists (13 percent), while the PPPs were nearly all neurologists (96 percent). One of the most interesting results was the number of patients seen during a physician's career: 1,964, comprising 1,557 for the HPs, and 407 for the PPPs. The responses describing care in terms of diagnosis and treatment generally complied with good practices as well as the recommendations and guidelines published in the field of MMN. CONCLUSION: MMN is a rare disorder whose prevalence in France, estimated by this survey, comes close to that published in the literature; diagnosis and treatment seem globally satisfactory."
18976322,"OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of Huntington's disease (HD) in Slovenia using direct mutation analysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Symptomatic patients and presymptomatic individuals at risk for HD referred to the Institute of Medical Genetics between 1997 and 2007 were included in the study. The patients were ascertained through multiple sources. The prevalence was estimated on 31 December 2006. RESULTS: A total of 116 and 68 individuals with CAG repeat number >36 were symptomatic and presymptomatic, respectively. The prevalence of HD in Slovenia was estimated at 5.16/10(5) (95% confidence interval 4.16-6.16). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report on the epidemiology and prevalence of HD in Slovenia. The prevalence of HD is comparable with previously reported data in other European countries. In Slovenia, a higher proportion of individuals at risk for HD decide on predictive mutational testing as compared with the estimated numbers for Europe, United States, Canada and Australia."
15300579,"BACKGROUND & AIMS:The prevalence of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) reported in different countries varies widely, indicating that genetic or environmental factors may be important in the etiology of the disease. The aim of this study was to examine this issue further by determining the overall prevalence of PBC in one state in Australia and to examine the prevalence among different migrant groups within this population. METHODS:Thorough case-finding methods were used to identify all cases of PBC in Victoria, Australia. Age-adjusted prevalence rates among different migrant groups were examined. RESULTS:A total of 249 cases were identified, giving a prevalence of 51 cases per million. This is significantly higher than the rate documented in a 1991 Victorian study. Prevalence in the 3 largest migrant groups was greater than that of Victoria as a whole (141, 200, and 208 cases per million in British, Italian, and Greek migrants, respectively). In women older than 40 years, previous studies have documented a prevalence of 940 cases per million in women in the United Kingdom; however, the prevalence was 344 cases per million in British-born immigrants to Victoria and 160 cases per million in Australian-born women. CONCLUSIONS:The current prevalence of PBC in Victoria is higher than previously reported, but the age-adjusted prevalence in those born in Victoria remains significantly lower than in the United Kingdom and is less than in migrant communities. These findings suggest that Victorians may be relatively protected from developing the disease and add further weight to the suggestion that environmental factors may play a role in the etiology of PBC."
2924205,"A very high prevalence (approximately 1/475 in 1985) of myotonic dystrophy (Steinert disease) is observed in the Saguenay region, which is located in the north-east part of the Province of Quebec. For various reasons, however, the literature on the subject generally associates a high degree of selective disadvantage with this gene, which seems to contradict the Saguenay data. Using a computerized regional population register, we have reconstituted patients' genealogies and family biographies. We have thus been able to study the origin of the gene and to compare the demographic behavior of patients and controls. On the whole, patients seem to be very little disadvantaged compared to controls, in terms of reproduction as well as of geographical and occupational mobility."
17918011,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the epidemiology of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) in Finland and to evaluate whether the possible increase in prevalence was attributable to the increasing incidence, better survival, or both. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The Hospital Discharge Register, pathology registers, and death certificates for the years 1988 99 were scrutinized, and the patients identified were followed-up for survival until 31 October 2004. The study area covered four university hospital districts: a total of 25 hospitals. The diagnosis of PBC was regarded as definite (or probable) if three (or two) of the following criteria were fulfilled: positive antimitochondrial antibodies, constantly elevated alkaline phosphatase, and compatible liver histology. RESULTS: In the total population of the study areas, the age-standardized prevalence of PBC increased during the study period from 103 (95% CI: 97-110) to 180 (172-189) per million inhabitants. Incidence increased from 12 (10-14) to 17 (15-20) per million inhabitants per year. The annual average increase in prevalence was 5.1% (4.2-5.9%, p <0.0001) and in incidence 3.5% (0.9%-6.0%, p =0.008). In gender-specific analyses among women, the prevalence of PBC increased from 161 (151-171) to 292 (277-207) per million during the study period and the incidence from 20 (16-24) to 27 (23-32) per million per year. The death rate was 4% per year and half the deaths were from liver-related causes. Survival after diagnosis during the study period lengthened. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of PBC increased in Finland during 1988-99, owing to both the increased incidence and the prolonged survival."
21791583,"To estimate the prevalence of corneal dystrophies.Records of almost 8 million enrollees in a national managed-care network throughout the United States who had an eye care visit in 2001 to 2009 were searched for a recording of corneal dystrophy on a claim submitted by an ophthalmologist or optometrist from January 1, 2001, through December 31, 2007.Unique individuals (n = 27,372) received two or more diagnoses of any type of corneal dystrophy, for an overall corneal dystrophy prevalence rate of 897 per million (10⁶) covered lives. Endothelial and anterior corneal dystrophies accounted for most of the reported dystrophies, and granular corneal dystrophy was the least common, being reported in 167 enrollees. Age, sex, and race variations among the various corneal dystrophies were observed. The mean age of those with macular corneal dystrophy (47.3 years) was 15 years younger than the age of those with endothelial dystrophy (62.9 years), and females were most highly represented (68.5%) among those with lattice corneal dystrophy. Hispanics and blacks were underrepresented relative to enrollees undergoing eye care for reasons other than corneal dystrophy. Keratoplasty was most frequently coded among those with lattice dystrophy.Although caveats must be considered in using claims data to estimate prevalence in a population, these data provide an indication of corneal dystrophy's prevalence within insured subjects across the United States. Variations in age, sex, and race, within and between the different types of corneal dystrophies, raise questions that warrant further study."
10930359,"Linkage studies were performed in a large family with an autosomal dominant phenotype characterized by nephropathy and hypertension. In this family of Iraqi Jewish origin, the nephropathy develops into progressive renal failure. By performing a genomewide linkage search, we localized the disease gene to chromosome 1q21; the highest LOD score was obtained for the marker at locus D1S305, which yielded a maximum LOD score of 4.71 at a recombination fraction of 0. Recombination mapping defined an interval of approximately 11.6 cM, between the markers at loci D1S2696 and D1S2635, that contains the disease gene. Localization of the disease-causing gene in this family represents a necessary step toward isolation of the defective gene and toward a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of hypertension and progressive renal failure."
2556632,"The Western Australian Familial Polyposis Registry was established in 1985 by the Cancer Foundation of Western Australia in conjunction with the Health Department of Western Australia. The primary aim of the Registry is the prevention of colorectal cancer in a group of persons at high risk of the disease. Families are notified to the Registry by medical practitioners throughout the State and, at the request of family members and medical practitioners, the project officer for the Registry will arrange for the collection of data, counselling and reminders for follow-up examinations for both cases and family members who are at risk of developing the disease. A total of 44 families with familial adenomatous polyposis is known to the Registry. The crude incidence of polyposis in Western Australia was 0.24 cases per 100,000 persons over the three-year period 1986-1988. The prevalence of the condition in 1988 was 2.59 cases per 100,000 persons. There are 188 family members in Western Australia who are at a 50% risk of developing familial adenomatous polyposis. Registry data indicate that regular follow-up and early treatment reduce the risk of the development of bowel cancer."
9805179,"Primary systemic vasculitic diseases are relatively rare. Untreated, they have a high morbidity and mortality. The introduction of steroids and cytotoxic drugs has dramatically reduced the mortality. In a retrospective study in a Norwegian community hospital, which serves a county with a population of 150,426 in 1996, 68 patients were found to have a primary vasculitis, 63 of whom fulfilled the ACR 1990 criteria. Patients with Henoch-Schönlein purpura aged less than 16 years and patients with Kawasaki's disease were excluded. The overall prevalence was 43.9 per 100,000 inhabitants (Churg-Strauss syndrome 1.3, hypersensitivity vasculitis 2.7, Henoch-Schönlein purpura 3.3, polyarteritis nodosa 3.3, Wegener's granulomatosis 5.3 and temporal arteritis 27.9). In most cases, disease control was achieved with corticosteroids alone, or with the addition of cytotoxic drugs. Two patients had died in the latest 5-year period but of unrelated disorders. Biopsy plays a major role in diagnosing vasculitic diseases. In our study, 62 patients had a positive biopsy supporting the diagnosis."
28130043,"To determine the prevalence and mortality of retinitis pigmentosa (RP) patients in Korea.Population-based retrospective cohort study.We used data covering the 2011-2014 period from the Rare Intractable Disease (RID) registry and Health Insurance Review and Assessment (HIRA) service, which include information on all patients diagnosed with RP based on predefined diagnostic criteria. Using the HIRA-RID database, we evaluated the prevalence and age at diagnosis of RP patients across the entire Korean population. We further linked the data from Statistics Korea to the HIRA-RID database to confirm mortality and causes of death.The prevalence in the total population across all ages was 11.09 per 105 people, and the prevalence in those over the age of 40 was 16.16 per 105 people. The age at diagnosis ranged from 0 to 95 and, on average, was 44.8. The standardized mortality ratio (SMR) was 1.56 for all ages, peaking at 2.61 in men aged 40-59, which was attributed to 6.6-fold higher suicide rates than the same age group in the general male population.This is the first nationwide epidemiologic study of RP patients covering the entire population of all ages. The results suggest that the prevalence of RP in Korea is about 1 in 9000 for all ages and 1 in 6000 for those over 40 years of age. The higher mortality of RP patients than that of the general population is attributable to a high suicide rate in male RP patients of working ages, which necessitates a careful attention to their mental health."
22418872,"A major increase in the incidence of BP has been recently reported in the United Kingdom. In addition, there are some controversies about the over-mortality of BP patients. The primary objective was to reevaluate the incidence of BP in France as compared with that we estimated 15 years ago. The secondary objective was to assess mortality of BP patients. BP incidence was retrospectively estimated from all BP cases diagnosed between January 2000 and December 2005 in three French regions with a total population of 3.858 million inhabitants. BP mortality was assessed from a prospective cohort accrued during the same time period. A total of 502 incident BP patients (mean age: 82.6±8.8 years) were identified. Overall estimated incidence was 21.7 cases per million persons per year (95%CI:19.8-23.7 cases per million persons per year), which is about 3-fold higher than the incidence that we estimated 15 years ago. In the population aged 70 years or above, BP incidence was 162 cases per million per year (95%CI:147-177 cases per million per year). The overall 1-year survival rate was 62% (95% CI: 56-67%). The risk of death for BP patients was more than six times greater than that for the general population (SMR:6.60; 95%CI:5.47-7.90). The incidence of BP in France has increased 3-fold in the last 15 years. BP is associated with high mortality."
11164060,"OBJECTIVE:To validate the Chinese version of Ullanlinna Narcolepsy Scale (CUNS). METHODS:A total of 234 subjects [163 male (69.7%) and 71 female (30.3%)] including 17 patients with narcolepsy, 21 normal controls and 196 patients with various sleep and psychiatric disorders were studied. The diagnoses of these patients were independently ascertained with sleep laboratory confirmation whenever indicated. All the subjects were interviewed through the telephone by a trained lay interviewer who was blind to the diagnosis. The questionnaire included demographic information, sleep habits and CUNS. RESULTS:Narcoleptic patients had a significantly higher CUNS score (18.6+/-4.7; 95% confidence interval (CI) 16.2-21.0) and differentiated well from all the other groups (F(6,227)=28.4, P<0.001). The CUNS has a satisfactory internal consistency with Cronbach's alpha of 0.75. The principal component analysis with varimax rotation revealed two factors, namely sleepiness and cataplexy factors, which accounted for 45.5% of the total variance. The best cut-off point for the CUNS scale was found to be at 13/14 with high specificity (93.5%), sensitivity (94.1%), negative predictive value (NPV, 99.5%) and modest positive predictive value (PPV, 53.3%). The AUC of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was 0.97 (95% CI 0.95-0.99). CONCLUSIONS:The CUNS was validated with satisfactory psychometric properties. The cross-cultural validation of UNS scale suggested that it could be used across the ethnic groups."
21726277,"AIMS: Wolfram syndrome, also known as DIDMOAD, is a relatively rare inherited neurodegenerative disorder, first evident in childhood as an association of juvenile-onset diabetes mellitus and optic atrophy, followed by diabetes insipidus and deafness. The aim of the study was to examine the clinical profile of patients with DIDMOAD syndrome presenting to a tertiary care hospital in north India. METHODS: Clinical presentation of juvenile-onset diabetes mellitus fulfilling the diagnosis of Wolfram syndrome was studied using a prepared standardized form. RESULTS: Subjects with juvenile-onset non-autoimmune diabetes mellitus attending the diabetic clinic at a tertiary care centre in north India were followed for 10 years and a diagnosis of fully developed Wolfram syndrome was confirmed in seven individuals. The series consisted of five male and two female patients with a mean age of 17.5 ±7.34 years. Two subjects had consanguinity and none had any other family member affected. Optic atrophy was present in all, sensorineural hearing loss in 4/7, central diabetes insipidus in 4/7 and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus in 2/7 subjects. The new associations found were: spastic myoclonus, short stature with pancreatic malabsorption, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, cyanotic heart disease and choledocholithiasis with cholangitis. Genetic analysis revealed mutation in exon 8 of the WFS1 gene in all the cases studied. CONCLUSIONS: The present clinical series of Wolfram syndrome reveals a varied clinical presentation of the syndrome and some new associations."
21035068,"To report the prevalence, clinical findings, and outcomes in children diagnosed with congenital dacryocystocele in a well-defined population during a 20-year period.The medical records of all Olmsted County, Minnesota, patients diagnosed with congenital dacryocystocele from January 1, 1988, through December 31, 2007, were retrospectively reviewed.A total of 9 children were diagnosed with dacryocystocele during the 20-year period, yielding a birth prevalence of 1 in 3,884 live births. The median age at diagnosis was 12 days (range, birth to 40 days); 7 (78%) were female. Eight patients (89%) had unilateral disease. Clinical findings included a cystic mass in all 9, dacryocystitis in 3 (33%), intranasal cysts in 3 (33%), and 1 (11%) each with facial cellulitis and dacryocystocele-induced astigmatism. Conservative treatment resolved the obstruction in 3 (33%), whereas the remaining 6 (67%) each underwent one surgery. Complete resolution was observed in all 9 patients.Congenital dacryocystocele is an uncommon unilateral condition of predominantly neonatal females. Clinical findings support a relatively high incidence of complications such as dacryocystitis and intranasal cysts as well as a less common finding of astigmatism that resolved without evidence of amblyopia. One-third of the cases were successfully managed with conservative treatment alone; most patients required surgical intervention."
24891339,"Chromosome 14 harbours an imprinted locus at 14q32. Maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 14, paternal deletions and loss of methylation at the intergenic differentially methylated region (IG-DMR) result in a human phenotype of low birth weight, hypotonia, early puberty and markedly short adult stature. The analysis of the world literature of 51 cases identifies the key features that will enhance diagnosis and potentially improve treatment. We found a median birth weight SD score (SDS) of -1.88 and median adult final height of -2.04 SDS. Hypotonia and motor delay were reported in 93% and 83% of cases, respectively. Early puberty was reported in 86% of cases with the mean age of menarche at 10 years and 2 months of age. Small hands and feet were reported frequently (87% and 96%, respectively). Premature birth was common (30%) and feeding difficulties frequently reported (n = 22). There was evidence of mildly reduced intellectual ability (measured IQ 75-95). Obesity was reported in 49% of cases, and three patients developed type 2 diabetes mellitus. Two patients were reported to have recurrent hypoglycaemia, and one of these patients was subsequently demonstrated to be growth hormone deficient and started replacement therapy. We propose the use of the name 'Temple syndrome' for this condition and suggest that improved diagnosis and long-term monitoring, especially of growth and cardiovascular risk factors, is required."
9521977,"OBJECTIVES:The aim of this study was to evaluate the benefits of neonatal screening for congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). METHODS:All children with CAH born in Sweden from January 1989 to December 1994 were subjected to a systematic follow-up. Clinical symptoms were recorded and laboratory data collected. The clinical diagnosis versus diagnosis by screening was investigated. The results were compared with those of a retrospective study of all patients diagnosed during 1969-1986 (before the introduction of neonatal screening). RESULTS:The prevalence of CAH in Sweden was 1:9800 with screening. Patients with CAH were identified earlier by screening. Half of the infants (47%) were not diagnosed at the time of recall, which was 8 days (median). In the study population, 25% of the girls and 73% of the boys were diagnosed by screening alone. The median age at the time of the definite diagnosis in boys was 21 days before screening as compared with 9 days (median) during the last part of the screening period. During the screening period, only 1 boy had a severe salt loss crisis, which occurred at the age of 8 days. Before screening, (1969-1986) 2 boys had died in the neonatal period because of an adrenal crisis. The lowest serum sodium recorded at the time of diagnosis was 124 mmol/L (median; range, 93-148) before, as compared with 134 mmol/L (median; range, 115-148) after the introduction of screening. The number of girls who were initially considered to be boys was not reduced by screening (17% vs 18%). The period of uncertainty regarding gender attributable to virilization was shortened considerably, as well as the time it took to make a correct gender assignment: 23 days (median) before screening versus 3 days (median) with screening. The maximum time it took to make the correct gender assignment was 960 days before screening and 14 days with screening. The number of patients diagnosed late, ie, after the first year of life, decreased considerably after the introduction of screening. The false-positive rate (when a new filter paper blood sample was requested or when a child was referred to a pediatrician for follow-up) was <0.05% and in about 60% of the cases, it was attributable to preterm infants. The cost of screening was US dollar 2.70 per screened infant. CONCLUSION:The main benefits of screening were avoidance of serious salt loss crises, earlier correct gender assignment in virilized girls, and detection of patients who would have otherwise been missed in the neonatal period. Deaths in the neonatal period were prevented by screening. The aim of the screening program was to identify patients with the severe forms of CAH. Nevertheless, it must be considered a distinct benefit that a number of patients with milder forms of CAH were detected earlier, because earlier therapy results in decreased virilization, normalized growth and puberty, and, in all probability, an improved psychosocial situation for these children. We conclude that, in the Swedish health care system, the benefits of screening for CAH outweigh the costs."
18589446,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the natural course of intestinal failure with onset in the neonatal period to provide data regarding the occurrence and to provide a population-based survey regarding the spectrum of underlying diseases. STUDY DESIGN: We performed a retrospective chart review including infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit of 7 Italian tertiary care centers. Intestinal failure was defined as a primary intestinal disease that induces the need of total parenteral nutrition (PN) for more than 4 weeks or the need of partial PN for more than 3 months. RESULTS: The total number of live births during the study time within the enrolled institutions was 30 353, and the number of newborns admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit was 5088. Twenty-six patients satisfied the definition of intestinal failure; thus the occurrence rate of intestinal failure was 0.1% among live-birth newborns and 0.5% among infants at high risk. The main underlying diseases leading to intestinal failure in neonatal age were congenital intestinal defects (42.3%), necrotizing enterocolitis (30.8%), severe intestinal motility disorder (11.5%), intestinal obstruction (7.7%), structural enterocyte defects (3.8%), and meconium peritonitis (3.8%). After a follow-up of 36 months, 84.6% of patients achieved intestinal competence, 1 patient was still receiving home PN, 1 patient underwent transplantation, and 2 patients died. Cholestatic liver disease was diagnosed in 54% of observed children. CONCLUSION: An understanding of the incidence, causes, and natural history of intestinal failure would be helpful to appropriately allocate resources and to plan clinical trials."
30528513,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS:The global epidemiological data of Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) are scant. A systemic review and meta-analysis aimed to estimate the incidence and prevalence of BCS. METHODS:PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases were searched. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess the study quality. The pooled incidence and prevalence of BCS with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by using a random-effect model. The heterogeneity was assessed by the Cochran's Q-test and I2 statistics. Subgroup analysis was conducted based on the study region (Asia or Europe). RESULTS:Overall, six studies were included. Among them, 2 studies were performed in Asian countries (i.e., Japan and South Korea) and 4 in European countries (i.e., Denmark, Sweden, Italy, and France). All of them were of high quality. The annual incidence of BCS was 0.168-4.09 per million. The prevalence of BCS was 2.40-33.10 per million. Meta-analyses showed that the pooled annual incidence of BCS was 1 per million (95% CI = 0.225-3 per million) and the pooled prevalence of BCS was 11 per million (95% CI = 4-21 per million). The heterogeneity among studies was statistically significant. Subgroup meta-analyses demonstrated that the pooled annual incidence of BCS was 0.469 per million in Asia and 2 per million in Europe and the pooled prevalence of BCS was 5 per million in Asia. CONCLUSION:Evidence from meta-analyses of existing literature confirmed that BCS should be a rare vascular liver disease. BCS may not be more common in Asia than Europe. More epidemiological data in other countries should be warranted."
8210228,"We investigated the prevalence of narcolepsy using a well-defined white population previously used for epidemiological investigations: the Finnish Twin Cohort. The Cohort consists of 13,888 monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs born before 1958. There were 16,179 individuals who participated in the study, with a 77.3% response rate. The study methodology included a questionnaire covering sleep and alertness, the Ullanlinna Narcolepsy Scale (UNS), a scale specifically developed and tested for the study, telephone interviews, and finally, clinical evaluation, polygraphic recording, and HLA blood typing. Seventy-five subjects were selected for telephone interviews and laboratory evaluations based on data from both questionnaires. Five of them were strongly suspected of narcolepsy, but laboratory data identified only 3. All were dizygotic (fraternal) twins discordant for the disease with a negative family history and presence of DR2 DQw1 (i.e., DRw15 DQw6, new World Health Organization classification). The prevalence of narcolepsy in the Finnish population is 0.026% (95% confidence interval, 0.0-0.06). This prevalence is lower than that reported in studies performed without polygraphic recording and is close to that reported in 1945 in the black U.S. population. The tools developed to perform this study, the largest population study of its kind yet performed, can now be used for other population investigations."
23107878,"Typical childhood spinal muscular atrophy is a disease that affects the anterior horn of the spinal cord related to SMN1 gene defects. Since no etiological treatment is currently available, its management is necessarily symptomatic and involves multidisciplinary care. The national plan on rare diseases for 2005-2008 developed by the French Ministry of Health resulted in the creation of 12 reference centres for neuromuscular diseases, mainly to improve their diagnosis and management. During the first one-day clinical research meeting on neuromuscular disorders, organized by the French Association to fight myopathies (AFM) in May 2007, clinicians from the 12 national reference centers led workshops for each of the main neuromuscular diseases. Concerning spinal muscular atrophy, discussions involving specialists from medical and allied professions were led by clinicians in charge of the workshop sessions. This paper reports the final version of their recommendation regarding the diagnosis, monitoring and management of typical infantile spinal muscular atrophy, which is necessarily multidisciplinary, including orthopedic, pulmonary, gastroenterology and nutrition care."
19893324,"BACKGROUND/AIM: To determine the prevalence and clinical spectrum of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) in Iceland. METHODS: We identified all individuals with symptomatic CMT, based on information from all practicing neurologists, both neurophysiology laboratories and the only neurology department in the country. The diagnosis was based on clinical features and neurophysiological testing. DNA testing was regarded as confirmatory. RESULTS: We identified 37 individuals in 18 families, which were not linked by identifying 5 generations of ancestors. The point prevalence (January 1, 2007) for all CMT subtypes in Iceland was 12.0/10(5), 10.1/10(5) for CMT1 and 2.0/10(5) for CMT2. The clinical features include lower limb weakness (95%), impaired gait (68%), decreased or absent deep tendon reflexes (86%), pes cavus (70%) and hammer toes (46%). Clinical symptoms were similar for the 2 main CMT subtypes. CONCLUSION: We report the prevalence and clinical spectrum of CMT, which is comparable to the results of other prevalence studies, in a well-defined, total population sample."
10368073,"PURPOSE:To determine the population-based epidemiology of infantile spasms (IS) among Atlanta children. METHODS:By using data from a cross-sectional, population-based surveillance system that included 21 EEG laboratories, we identified children born in 1975-1977 in metropolitan Atlanta with IS. Cumulative incidence up to age 2 years was estimated from the number of children with IS born in the study area in 1975-1977, and age-specific prevalence was calculated from the number of children previously diagnosed with IS who lived in the study area at age 10 years. Data regarding coexisting disabilities were available from the surveillance system for developmental disabilities. RESULTS:The cumulative incidence of IS was 2.9/10,000 live births; half of the children with IS had cryptogenic IS. The age-specific prevalence of IS was 2.0/10,000 among 10-year-old children. Eighty-three percent of 10-year-old children with a history of IS had mental retardation (MR, IQ < or =70); 56% of children with a history of IS had profound MR (IQ <20). Developmental outcome did not differ between the children with cryptogenic IS and those with symptomatic IS. Among the 10-year-old children with profound MR who were living in Atlanta at age 10 years, 12% had a history of IS. Fifty percent of children with IS developed Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) before age 11 years. CONCLUSIONS:The syndrome of IS is rare in the general population, yet a significant percentage of all children with profound MR and severe childhood epilepsy syndromes in the general population have a history of IS."
10579250,"OBJECTIVE:To define the occurrence rate of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) using established criteria in a well-defined general patient population, to study the clinical course of ARDS when patients were ventilated using a ""lung-protective"" strategy, and to define the total costs of care. DESIGN:A 3-yr (1993 through 1995) retrospective descriptive analysis of all patients with ARDS treated in Kuopio University Hospital. SETTING:Intensive care unit in the university hospital. PATIENTS:Fifty-nine patients fulfilled the definition of ARDS: Pao2/Fio2 <200 mm Hg (33.3 kPa) during mechanical ventilation and bilateral infiltrates on chest radiograph. INTERVENTIONS:None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS:With a patient data management system, the day-by-day data of hemodynamics, ventilation, respiratory mechanics, gas exchange, and organ failures were collected during the period that Pao2/Fio2 ratio was <200 mm Hg (33.3 kPa). The frequency of ARDS was 4.9 cases/100,000 inhabitants/yr. Pneumonia and sepsis were the most common causes of ARDS. Mean age was 43+/-2 yrs. At the time of lowest Pao2/Fio2, the nonsurvivors had lower arterial and venous oxygen saturations and higher arterial lactate than survivors, whereas there were no differences between the groups in other parameters. Multiple organ dysfunction preceded the worst oxygenation in both the survivors and nonsurvivors. The intensive care mortality was 37%; hospital mortality and mortality after a minimum 8 months of follow-up was 42%. The most frequent cause of death was multiple organ failure. The effective costs of intensive care per survivor were US $73,000. CONCLUSIONS:The outcome of ARDS is unpredictable at the time of onset and also at the time of the worst oxygenation. Keeping the inspiratory pressures low (30-35 cm H2O [2.94 to 3.43 kPa]) reduces the frequency of pneumothorax, and might lower the mortality. Most patients are young, and therefore the costs per saved year of life are low."
18694401,"BACKGROUND: The exact incidence and prevalence of Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) is unknown in the general population. Published reports differ in terms of the clinical characteristics, effects of therapy and survival. AIMS: To investigate the epidemiology, clinical presentation and survival in patients with BCS. METHODS: Retrospective multicentre study in Sweden reviewing the medical records of all patients with BCS 1986-2003, identified from the computerised diagnosis database of 11 hospitals, including all university hospitals and liver transplantation centres. RESULTS: Forty-three patients with BCS were identified, of whom nine (21%) had concomitant portal vein thrombosis. The mean age-standardised incidence and prevalence rates in 1990-2001 were calculated to be 0.8 per million per year and 1.4 per million inhabitants respectively. Myeloproliferative disorders (38%), thrombophilic factors (31%) and oral contraceptives (30%) were common aetiological factors. Two or more risk factors were present in 44%. In 23%, no risk factor was evident. The median follow-up time was 2.7 years. Seventy-two percent were on anticoagulant therapy during follow-up. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting, surgical shunting procedures and liver transplantation were performed in 4, 6 and 18 patients respectively. Nineteen patients died. The overall transplantation-free survival at 1, 5 and 10 years was 47, 28 and 17% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Budd-Chiari syndrome is a rare disorder; the mean age-standardised incidence and prevalence rates in Sweden in 1990-2001 were calculated to be 0.8 per million per year and 1.4 per million inhabitants respectively. The presence of a myeloproliferative disorder was a common aetiological factor in our cohort and about half of the patients had a multifactorial aetiology. The transplantation-free survival was poor."
22241917,"OBJECTIVES:To estimate the incidence of clinically diagnosed congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), clinical features and age at first presentation. To assess the potential benefit of newborn screening for CAH. DESIGN:Active surveillance through the British Paediatric Surveillance Unit of all children aged under 16 years with newly diagnosed CAH, undertaken prospectively between August 2007 and August 2009. Twelve laboratories testing for CAH reported new diagnoses between August 2007 and January 2009. Reporting clinicians completed clinical questionnaires. SETTING:England, Wales and Scotland. RESULTS:144 children with CAH were reported, of whom 132 (92%) had 21-hydroxylase deficiency. Thirty-six (25%) children were Asian and 62 (43%; 95% CI 35% to 51%) were boys. Incidence of new diagnoses in children ≤ 16 years was 0.60 (95% CI 0.50 to 0.71) per 100,000. Eighty-six (59%; 36 boys) children were diagnosed in the first year of life (estimated birth prevalence 5.48 (95% CI 4.42 to 6.81) per 100,000), most (77; 89%) of whom presented in the first month of life. Virilised genitalia were found in three-quarters of girls. Twenty-seven newborns first presented with salt-wasting crises, of whom 18 (67%; 16 boys) presented on or after 14 days of age. CONCLUSIONS:Approximately one child in every 18 000 born in Great Britain has CAH. Similar numbers of boys and girls present clinically in the first year of life, but boys present with more severe manifestations, such as salt-wasting crises. Around 70% of newborns who first present with salt-wasting crisis would be detected earlier through newborn screening."
17898523,"We aimed to estimate the incidence and prevalence of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in the South East of England. The reported incidence of ALS varies between 0.44 and 3.2 per 100,000 person years. This can partly be explained by differences in design and diagnostic criteria used. There is little population data concerning England, particularly the South East.A population study of South-East England (total population: 2,890,482) was carried out and multiple sources including our tertiary centre and district general hospitals were used for complete case ascertainment.Between 1 January 2002 and 30 June 2006 we identified 138 people (76 males; 62 females) with a new diagnosis of ALS, giving a crude incidence of 1.06 per 100,000 person years. The projected age- and gender-adjusted annual incidence rate for England and Wales was 1.10 (95% CI 0.80-1.40). 142 people were alive on 30 June 2006, giving a point prevalence of 4.91 per 100,000 population.Our incidence and prevalence rates are similar to those reported in comparable studies from other countries. This argues against the role of a specific exogenous factor in the aetiology of ALS in South-East England."
16713671,"The aim of this study was to estimate the incidence and prevalence of myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) in Belgrade during the period 1983-2002. The patients who had DM1 were ascertained through hospital records from all neurological departments in Belgrade during 1983-2002. The molecular genetic analysis was performed in all patents included in the study. We identified 101 DM1 patients (52 males and 49 females). The average annual incidence rate of DM1 in Belgrade for the period observed was 2.0/1,000,000 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.3-8.3), 2.1/1,000,000 (95% CI, 0.3-8.3) for males and 2.0/1,000,000 (95% CI, 0.3-8.3) for females. The highest age-specific DM1 incidence was registered in the age group 20-49: 3.4/1,000,000 (95% CI, 0.5-7.6), 4.0/1,000,000 (95% CI, 1.1-10.2) in males and 2.5/1,000,000 (95% CI, 0.5-7.6) in females. In the population of Belgrade, a cumulative probability of acquiring DM1 was 1 per 8621 for men and 1 per 9259 for women (1 per 8940 of the population for both sexes). The prevalence of DM1 in Belgrade on 31 December 2002 was 5.3/100,000 (95% CI, 4.2-6.6)."
24044606,"Thalassemia syndrome has diverse clinical presentations and a global spread that has far exceeded the classical Mediterranean basin where the mutations arose. The mutations that give rise to either alpha or beta thalassemia are numerous, resulting in a wide spectrum of clinical severity ranging from carrier state to life-threatening, inherited hemolytic anemia that requires regular blood transfusion. Beta thalassemia major constitutes a remarkable challenge to health care providers. The complications arising due to the anemia, transfusional iron overload, as well as other therapy-related complications add to the complexity of this condition. To produce this consensus opinion manuscript, a PubMed search was performed to gather evidence-based original articles, review articles, as well as published work reflecting the experience of physicians and scientists in the Arabian Gulf region in an effort to standardize the management protocol."
21157886,"BACKGROUND: The population prevalence of multiple congenital contractures, many of which have either arthrogryposis multiplex congenita or amyoplasia congenita, ranges from 1/3300 to 1/56,000. Three other studies report a range of 1/4500 to 1/12,500. Classification and coding of these disorders in the International Classification of Diseases, tenth edition, (ICD-10) is less than satisfactory, even when augmented by the Royal College of Pediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH). expansion. METHODS: The database of the Alberta Congenital Anomalies Surveillance System (ACASS) was used to review all cases (1980-2007) of the previously named disorders with special emphasis on the 1997-2007 cohort. The latter period was chosen because more complete ascertainment was likely due to the addition of terminations of pregnancy data beginning in 1997. This cohort was further analyzed into the three practical groups: I, limb only; II, limb plus non-central nervous system anomalies; and III, limb plus lethality, central nervous system anomalies, or both, with further syndrome identification in groups II and III. The ICD-10-RCPCH classification and codes were reviewed. RESULTS: The prevalence for multiple congenital contractures in Alberta is 1/8700 for 1980-1996 and 1/4300 for 1997-2007. Rates for the three groups were calculated. Specific diagnostic categories were found in groups II and III of 43% and 65%, respectively. Mortality is high, especially in the first month of life (45% total losses). New classification and coding systems are proposed."
10577638,"BACKGROUND:The prevalence of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and multiple system atrophy (MSA) in the general population is unknown. Clinicopathological studies of patients diagnosed as having Parkinson's disease suggest that the two disorders may be underdiagnosed. We investigated the population prevalence of these disorders. METHODS:We screened computerised records of 15 general practices in London, UK, for patients with specific diagnostic labels suggestive of Parkinson's disease or parkinsonism and all patients who had ever received antiparkinsonian medication. We assessed eligible patients by review of records, interview, physical examination, and video recordings of neurological signs for independent diagnostic confirmation. We diagnosed parkinsonian disorders according to published criteria and further reviewed patients with atypical features after 1 year. FINDINGS:The participation rate was 84%. The age-adjusted prevalence for PSP was 6.4 per 100,000 (five probable and one possible case [95% CI 2.3-10.6]) and for MSA 4.4 per 100,000 (two probable and two possible cases [1.2-7.6]). An additional four atypical patients were identified at 1 year but did not fulfil criteria for PSP or MSA. INTERPRETATION:Our results suggest that the true prevalence of PSP and MSA has been underestimated, since many patients in the community remain undiagnosed or misdiagnosed."
15637713,"Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) and Laurence-Moon syndrome (LMS) have a similar phenotype, which includes retinal dystrophy, obesity, and hypogenitalism. They are differentiated by the presence of spasticity and the absence of polydactyly in LMS. The aims of this study were to describe the epidemiology of BBS and LMS, further define the phenotype, and examine genotype-phenotype correlation. The study involved 46 patients (26 males, 20 females) from 26 families, with a median age of 44 years (range 1-68 years). Assessments were performed in 1986, 1993, and 2001 and included neurological assessments, anthropometric measurements, and clinical photographs to assess dysmorphic features. The phenotype was highly variable within and between families. Impaired co-ordination and ataxia occurred in 86% (18/21). Thirty percent (14/46) met criteria for psychiatric illness; other medical problems included cholecystectomy in 37% (17/46) and asthma in 28% (13/46). Dysmorphic features included brachycephaly, large ears, and short, narrow palpebral fissures. There was no apparent correlation of clinical or dysmorphic features with genotype. Two patients were diagnosed clinically as LMS but both had mutations in a BBS gene. The features in this population do not support the notion that BBS and LMS are distinct. The lack of a genotype-phenotype correlation implies that BBS proteins interact and are necessary for the development of many organs."
17122114,"PURPOSE: To map the gene that causes brittle cornea syndrome (BCS). METHODS: Five patients from four families, all of Jewish Tunisian origin, were recruited into the study. Four of the five patients had red hair. DNA from the five patients and 104 control chromosomes was typed with seven 16q polymorphic markers surrounding the hair color gene, MC1R. RESULTS: A common haplotype in the homozygous state, comprising five markers spanning 4.7 Mb on chromosome 16q24, was found in all five patients but in none of the control subjects (P < 0.00001). CONCLUSIONS: The gene that causes BCS maps to a 4.7-Mb interval, between the markers D16S3423 and D16S3425 on 16q24."
22835602,"Management of Hodgkin's lymphoma continues to develop. Outcomes for patients with favourable-risk, early-stage disease are excellent, and serial reductions in intensity of treatment have been made to retain the excellent prognosis while reducing the late effects of treatment. Prognosis is also very good in advanced-stage disease but the rate of relapse is higher than in early-stage disease, and the optimum first-line treatment is unclear. Workers are investigating the role of functional imaging to assess whether treatment can be tailored according to response, with the most intensive therapies reserved for patients predicted to have poor outcomes. In this Seminar we critically appraise the management of Hodgkin's lymphoma in early-stage disease, advanced-stage disease, and at relapse, with a focus on late effects of treatment."
22139816,"BACKGROUND: Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (WM) is a non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) subtype. Little is known about the incidence and trends for this disease in the United States. METHODS: Twenty-year data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program were used for this study. SEER*Stat was used for data analysis. RESULTS: Of the 95,797 cases of NHL diagnosed between 1988 and 2007 in 9 SEER registries, 1835 (1.9%) were new cases of WM. Median age at diagnosis of WM was 73 years. The overall annual age-adjusted incidence was 0.38 per 100,000 persons per year, which increased with age, ranging from 0.03 in patients aged <50 years to 2.85 in patients aged ≥80 years. The incidence of WM was higher in men (0.54) than in women (0.27; P < .001) and was higher in whites (0.41) than in African Americans (0.18) or other races (0.21; P < .05). The annual percentage change for the whole population was 1.01% (P > .05). The annual percentage change was 1.21% for whites (P < .05) and 0.80% (P > .05) for nonwhites. Significant annual percentage change increases were seen in the group aged 70 to 79 years (1.24%; P < .05) and in 3 geographic registries (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Although the overall incidence of WM remained steady over time, significant increases in incidence were seen over the past 20 years in whites, in those aged 70 to 79 years, and in 3 geographic registry areas."
19566661,"BACKGROUND: Bullous pemphigoid (BP), pemphigus vulgaris (PV) and pemphigus foliaceus (PF) are autoimmune bullous diseases characterized by the presence of tissue-bound and circulating autoantibodies directed against disease-specific target antigens of the skin. Although rare, these diseases run a chronic course and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. There are few prospective data on gender- and age-specific incidence of these disorders. OBJECTIVES: Our aims were: (i) to evaluate the incidence of BP and PV/PF in Swiss patients, as the primary endpoint; and (ii) to assess the profile of the patients, particularly for comorbidities and medications, as the secondary endpoint. METHODS: The protocol of the study was distributed to all dermatology clinics, immunopathology laboratories and practising dermatologists in Switzerland. All newly diagnosed cases of BP and pemphigus occurring between 1 January 2001 and 31 December 2002 were collected. In total, 168 patients (73 men and 95 women) with these autoimmune bullous diseases, with a diagnosis based on clinical, histological and immunopathological criteria, were finally included. RESULTS: BP showed a mean incidence of 12.1 new cases per million people per year. Its incidence increased significantly after the age of 70 years, with a maximal value after the age of 90 years. The female/male ratio was 1.3. The age-standardized incidence of BP using the European population as reference was, however, lower, with 6.8 new cases per million people per year, reflecting the ageing of the Swiss population. In contrast, both PV and PF were less frequent. Their combined mean incidence was 0.6 new cases per million people per year. CONCLUSIONS; This is the first comprehensive prospective study analysing the incidence of autoimmune bullous diseases in an entire country. Our patient cohort is large enough to establish BP as the most frequent autoimmune bullous disease. Its incidence rate appears higher compared with other previous studies, most likely because of the demographic characteristics of the Swiss population. Nevertheless, based on its potentially misleading presentations, it is possible that the real incidence rate of BP is still underestimated. Based on its significant incidence in the elderly population, BP should deserve more public health concern."
14967851,"To estimate the incidence and document the clinical characteristics of Williams-Beuren syndrome in the Hong Kong Chinese population.Cytogenetic analysis and retrospective study.Clinical Genetic Service, Department of Health, Hong Kong.Forty-one Chinese patients with Williams-Beuren syndrome.From 1 January 1995 to 30 June 2002, fluorescence in situ hybridisation was used to confirm diagnoses in 41 cases of Williams-Beuren syndrome by detecting chromosome 7q microdeletion. Case records were reviewed, the incidence of the condition in the local population was estimated, and the main clinical characteristics were determined.The minimal incidence of Williams-Beuren syndrome in this locality was estimated to be approximately 1 per 23500 live births. Common dysmorphic facial features included periorbital fullness (83%), full lips (80%), a long philtrum (51%), a flat nasal bridge (41%), and abnormal teeth (37%). No patients had a stellate iris. The majority (82%) had at least one documented cardiac anomaly; among these patients, peripheral pulmonary stenosis was diagnosed in 61% and supravalvular aortic stenosis in 45%. Nearly all (93%) of the study group exhibited developmental delay.As in the West, patients with Williams-Beuren syndrome in the Hong Kong Chinese population display craniofacial dysmorphism, cardiovascular anomalies, and mental deficiency. Supravalvular aortic stenosis-the cardiac defect most commonly associated with Williams-Beuren syndrome in western countries-is less common than peripheral pulmonary stenosis in this region. Studies involving periodic cardiovascular evaluation are needed to confirm if this difference is significant."
8407119,"The data of 750 consecutive uveitis patients who visited the uveitis department of the Rotterdam Eye Hospital were analysed by computer. Anterior uveitis was diagnosed most frequently (52%), mostly the acute form. We found a high percentage of Fuchs' heterochromic iridocyclitis and HLA-B27+ iridocyclitis. In the posterior uveitis group appeared the more recent clinical entities such as acute retinal necrosis, Birdshot retinochoroidopathy, CMV-retinitis, AMPPE and ocular candidiasis. Ocular Toxoplasmosis was still the leading cause in this group. These data will be compared with other studies of similar populations. Factors influencing frequency of subtypes of uveitis and bias of this study will be discussed."
25887961,"Patients with chronic abdominal pain occasionally suffer from the anterior cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome (ACNES). A substantial number of patients report previous visits to an emergency department (ED) with acute pain. Aim of this study was to obtain the incidence of ACNES in patients presenting with abdominal pain in the ED of a Dutch teaching hospital.In this observational study, data sets of all patients visiting Máxima Medical Center's (MMC) ED in 2011-2012 were searched for key terms 'ACNES', 'intercostal neuralgia' or 'abdominal wall pain'. Files of potential patients living within hospital's adherence area were checked using accepted criteria indicating the presence of ACNES. Disease incidence was calculated as a ratio to the hospital's adherence data. The ACNES MMC 2013's incidence in patients evaluated in the surgical outpatient department was also calculated.During the study period, 473 ED patient files met inclusion criteria. A total of 88 patients belonging to MMC's adherence area were diagnosed with ACNES leading to a mean 22/100.000 ACNES yearly incidence rate. About one of 50 patients with abdominal pain visiting the ED suffered from ACNES. A 35/100.000 outpatient department ACNES incidence rate was calculated in the year of 2013. Combining these two ratios, a 1:1800 ACNES incidence in the general population was obtained.In an ED setting of a Dutch teaching hospital, approximately 2% of patients presenting with acute abdominal pain suffered from ACNES. ED physicians should consider ACNES in abdominal pain patients with normal laboratory or imaging tests."
29048419,"PurposeFarber disease (OMIM 22800) is an ultrarare progressive multisystemic neurodevelopmental storage disorder caused by a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme acid ceramidase (AC). Hard clinical end points for future clinical trials remain to be defined.MethodsWe quantitatively analyzed published cases with Farber disease (N = 96). The main outcome variables were survival and diagnostic delay. As a potential predictor of survival, the influence of residual AC enzyme activity was investigated. The analysis was performed in compliance with STROBE criteria.ResultsThe median survival period of the study population was 3 years. The median age at disease onset was 3 months, and the median age at diagnosis was 17 months. The median diagnostic delay was 13.75 months. Patients with residual AC activity in fibroblasts at more than 5.1% of the normal level survived significantly longer than patients with residual AC activity below this threshold. In addition, higher residual AC activity was associated with a later onset of symptoms.ConclusionFarber disease onset is in infancy. Diagnostic delay is typically substantial. Our data suggest a phenotype-biomarker association with implications for future clinical and therapeutic trials. In the absence of a prospective multicenter natural-history study protocol, we believe that our modeling approach, based on published case descriptions, is the best and most timely approximation for generalizability."
12088082,"There are limited population-based data on the occurrence of Williams syndrome. We estimated its prevalence combining data from two investigations. One was an epidemiologic study originally designed to assess the prevalence and etiology of mental retardation among 30,037 Norwegian children born between 1980 and 1985 and living in Akershus County on January 1, 1993. The other investigation was a national survey of Williams syndrome. In the first study, 213 children were referred for evaluation, whereas the second study comprised 57 cases with Williams syndrome born between 1970 and 1992, who were referred for evaluation from all Norwegian counties. The epidemiologic study revealed three children with Williams syndrome, whereas one additional case complying with our demographic criteria was identified in the national survey, thus giving a prevalence of 1 in 7500. In all cases, a typical chromosome 7q11.23 deletion was detected. We also conclude that Williams syndrome is not an uncommon cause of mental retardation, with a prevalence of approximately 6% of patients with genetic etiology."
15659944,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW:Acute lung injury and its extreme manifestation, acute respiratory distress syndrome, complicate a wide variety of serious medical and surgical conditions, only some of which affect the lung directly. Despite recent evidence-based advances in clinical management, acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome are associated with significant mortality. Detailed epidemiology is essential in guiding the recruitment of patients into trials of new therapeutic interventions, thereby improving outcome and allowing directed allocation of scarce resources. RECENT FINDINGS:The incidence of acute lung injury in the United States overall (17-64 per 100,000 person-years) seems to be higher than in Europe, Australia, and other developed countries (17-34 per 100, 000 person-years). The mortality rates for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome range from 34 to 58%. The hypothesis that pulmonary and extrapulmonary acute respiratory distress syndromes are different disease entities continues to gain momentum. A genetic predisposition to acute respiratory distress syndrome may contribute to its pathogenesis and outcome. SUMMARY:Recent epidemiologic studies of the incidence of acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome have indicated a similar incidence in developed societies, and they confirm that mortality is falling in comparison with a decade ago. The awaited publication of new consensus guidelines for the definition of acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome may render new studies necessary."
15815000,"Between 1999 and 2002, 496 invasive group A streptococcal (GAS) isolates from clinical microbiological departments in Denmark and subsequently 487 (98%) questionnaires from the clinicians treating the patients were received as part of a national surveillance. emm types and streptococcal superantigen (SAg) genes were determined. The incidence of invasive GAS infections was on average 2.3 per 100,000 per year. Bacteremia with no focal symptoms (27%) was together with erysipelas (20%) the most prevalent clinical diagnoses. Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome occurred in 10% of patients, of which 56% died. The overall case fatality rate within 30 days was 23%. In total, 47 different emm types were identified, of which emm1, emm3, emm4, emm12, emm28, and emm89 were identified in 72% of the 493 available isolates. During the 4-year period the presence of emm1 increased from 16% in 1999 to 40% in 2002. Concurrently, the presence of emm3 decreased from 23% in 1999 to 2% in 2002. The emm1 isolates predominantly carried speA, although the frequency decreased from 94% in 1999 to 71% in 2002, whereas the emm1-specific prevalence of speC increased from 25 to 53%. In a historical perspective, this could be interpreted as a reemergence of emm1 and could indicate a possible introduction of a new emm1 subclone. However, this reemergence did not result in any significant changes in the clinical manifestations during the study period. Our results show the complexity of invasive GAS infections, with time-dependent variations in the incidence and distribution of emm and SAg genes, which emphasizes the need for continuous epidemiological and molecular investigations."
21134832,"BACKGROUND: Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is an uncommon autoimmune cholestatic disease that predominantly affects women. Certain human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) have been reported to be associated with susceptibility for PBC. We describe the profiles of PBC in Brunei Darussalam. METHODS: All patients with PBC (n = 10) were identified from our prospective databases. The HLA profiles (n = 9, PBC) were compared to controls (n = 65) and patients with autoimmune hepatitis (n = 13, AIH). RESULTS: All patients were women with a median age of 51 years (27-83) at diagnosis. The prevalence rate of the disease was 25.6/million-population and the estimated incidence rate varied from 0 to 10.3/million-population per year. Chinese (41.15/million) and the indigenous (42.74/million) groups had higher prevalence rates compared to Malays (22.62/million). The prevalence among female population was 54.6/million-population. All patients were referred for abnormal liver profiles. Five patients had symptoms at presentations: jaundice (20%), fatigue (20%), arthralgia (30%) and pruritus (20%). Serum anti-mitochondrial antibody was positive in 80% of the patients. Overlap with AIH was seen in 30%. Liver biopsies (n = 8) showed stage I (n = 2), II (n = 4) and III (n = 2) fibrosis. There were no significant differences in the HLA profiles between PBC and AIH. Compared to the controls, PBC patients had significantly more HLA class I alleles specifically B7 (P = 0.003), Cw7 (P = 0.002) and Cw12 (P = 0.007) but not the class II alleles. At a median follow-up of 23.5 months (2 to 108), all patients were alive without evidence of disease progression. CONCLUSIONS: PBC is also a predominant female disorder in our local setting and most had mild disease. The HLA profiles of our patients were different to what have been reported."
10209187,"Although there are now widely accepted diagnostic criteria for chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) there are few epidemiological data. A prevalence study was performed in the four Thames health regions, population 14 049 850. The prevalence date was 1 January 1995. Data were from a national consultant neurologist surveillance programme and the personal case series of two investigators. A diagnosis of CIDP was made according to definite, probable, possible, or suggestive diagnostic criteria. A wide difference in prevalence rates between the four health regions was noted, probably due to reporting bias. In the South East Thames Region, from which the data were most comprehensive the prevalence for definite and probable cases was 1.00/100 000; the highest total prevalence (if possible and suggestive cases were included) would have been 1.24/100 000. On the prevalence date 13% of patients required aid to walk and 54% were still receiving treatment."
15961947,"BACKGROUND: Primary hyperoxaluria (PH) is a heterogeneous disease with variable age of onset and inconsistent progression into renal failure (ESRF). AIMS: In 1994 we initiated a survey within our Pediatric Nephrology working group to ascertain epidemiologic data and current practices. Updates were performed in 2000 and 2004. RESULTS: Diagnosis of PH was made in 65 patients (42 with PH type I, 3 with PH type II, 12 unclassified and 8 reported dead), which suggests a minimum prevalence of 0.7 per 1 million of the population. First symptoms were urolithiasis, nephrocalcinosis, urinary tract infection or hematuria. Diagnosis was often delayed and was made only in ESRF in 11% of patients. Measurement of urine metabolites or plasma oxalate in ESRF was performed in 76 and 57%, respectively. Determination of enzyme activity in liver biopsy (55% overall) and mutation analysis have increasingly been performed since 2000 (84.2 and 51%). Treatment included high fluid intake, pyridoxine, citrate and magnesium preparations. Pyridoxine response was reported in 21% of patients. No genotype/phenotype correlation was seen. Most patients (39) do not require renal replacement therapy, 5 patients receive chronic hemodialysis. Preemptive liver (n = 5) and combined liver-kidney transplantation (n = 9) were the preferred transplantation procedures. CONCLUSION: Despite increasing knowledge and awareness, diagnosis of PH is still too often delayed and diagnosis only made in ESRF. Most German patients, however, do currently not require renal replacement therapy. Genotype/phenotype correlations were not found. Combined liver kidney transplantation is the preferred procedure, but has its specific risks. Additional treatment options are clearly needed."
1303629,"Estimates of the Apert syndrome birth prevalence and the mutation rate are reported for Washington State, Nebraska, Denmark, Italy, Spain, Atlanta, and Northern California. Data were pooled to increase the number of Apert births (n = 57) and produce a more stable birth prevalence estimate. Birth prevalence of the Apert syndrome was calculated to be approximately 15.5/1,000,000 births, which is twice the rate determined in earlier studies. The major reason appears to be incomplete ascertainment in the earlier studies. The similarity of the point estimates and the narrow bounds of the confidence limits in the present study suggest that the birth prevalence of the Apert syndrome over different populations is fairly uniform. The mutation rate was calculated to be 7.8 x 10(-6) per gene per generation. Apert syndrome accounts for about 4.5% of all cases of craniosynostosis. The mortality rate appears to be increased compared to that experienced in the general population; however, further study of the problem is necessary."
2351917,"This was a retrospective case-control study of hydrops fetalis due to Bart hemoglobinopathy at Ramathibodi Hospital between 1978-1987. The incidence was 0.61 per 1,000 deliveries. Hydrops fetalis tend to go into labour prematurely with smaller fetuses and larger placentae. When compared with the control group there were statistically significant differences in the history of previous perinatal loss and obstetric complications i.e. hypertensive disorder in pregnancy and postpartum hemorrhage. Early diagnosis and termination of pregnancy will avoid these complications."
23532946,"Fraser syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by cryptophthalmos, cutaneous syndactyly, laryngeal, and urogenital malformations. We present a population-based epidemiological study using data provided by the European Surveillance of Congenital Anomalies (EUROCAT) network of birth defect registries. Between January 1990 and December 2008, we identified 26 cases of Fraser syndrome in the monitored population of 12,886,464 births (minimal estimated prevalence of 0.20 per 100,000 or 1:495,633 births). Most cases (18/26; 69%) were registered in the western part of Europe, where the mean prevalence is 1 in 230,695 births, compared to the prevalence 1 in 1,091,175 for the rest of Europe (P = 0.0003). Consanguinity was present in 7/26 (27%) families. Ten (38%) cases were liveborn, 14 (54%) pregnancies were terminated following prenatal detection of a serious anomaly, and 2 (8%) were stillborn. Eye anomalies were found in 20/24 (83%), syndactyly in 14/24 (58%), and laryngeal anomalies in 5/24 (21%) patients. Ambiguous genitalia were observed in 3/24 (13%) cases. Bilateral renal agenesis was present in 12/24 (50%) and unilateral in 4/24 (17%) cases. The frequency of anorectal anomalies was particularly high (42%). Most cases of Fraser syndrome (85%) are suspected prenatally, often due to the presence of the association of renal agenesis and cryptophthalmos. In the European population, a high proportion (82%) of pregnancies is terminated, thus reducing the live birth prevalence to a third of the total prevalence rate."
20108378,"Data on the incidence of Parkinson's disease (PD) and atypical parkinsonian syndromes (APS) in East European countries and Asia are limited. The objective of this prospective population-based study was to determine the incidence of PD and APS in the Russian population. The study area was a large district of Moscow with a population of 1,237,900 inhabitants. Multiple sources of case ascertainment were used to identify incident cases of PD and APS between July 2006 and December 2008. All incident cases were examined by a specialist and followed up prospectively to confirm the diagnosis. The age-standardized incidence rates per 100,000/year were 9.03 [95% confidence interval (CI) 8.01-10.15] for PD, 0.11 (95% CI 0.03-0.23) for multiple system atrophy, 0.14 (95% CI 0.08-0.21) for progressive supranuclear palsy, and 0.02 (95% CI 0.01-0.12) for corticobasal degeneration. The age-standardized male-to-female ratio of PD was 0.87 for all ages and 1.46 for those aged 60 and older. A high proportion of new cases with PD (34%) and APS (50%) had comorbid depressive symptoms. Given the rapid growth of the elderly population in Eastern Europe and Asia, the epidemiology of PD and APS in these regions should be investigated in greater depth. The incidence of PD in our study was slightly lower than in studies of Western populations and the male-to-female ratio was closer to those reported in studies from Asia. The clinical implication of our study is that it highlights the need for better diagnosis and treatment of depression in early stages of PD."
10351930,"To determine the incidence and 90-d mortality of acute respiratory failure (ARF), acute lung injury (ALI), and the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), we carried out an 8-wk prospective cohort study in Sweden, Denmark, and Iceland. All intensive care unit (ICU) admissions (n = 13,346) >/= 15 yr of age were assessed between October 6th and November 30th, 1997 in 132 of 150 ICUs with resources to treat patients with intubation and mechanical ventilation (I + MV) >/= 24 h. ARF was defined as I + MV >/= 24 h. ALI and ARDS were defined using criteria recommended by the American-European Consensus Conference on ARDS. Calculation to correct the incidence for unidentified subjects from nonparticipating ICUs was made. No correction for in- or out-migration from the study area was possible. The population in the three countries >/= 15 yr of age was 11.74 million. One thousand two hundred thirty-one ARF patients were included, 287 ALI and 221 ARDS patients were identified. The incidences were for ARF 77.6, for ALI 17.9, and for ARDS 13.5 patients per 100,000/yr. Ninety-day mortality was 41.0% for ARF, including ALI and ARDS patients, 42.2% for ALI not fulfilling ARDS criteria, and 41.2% for ARDS."
21924570,"A research committee supported by the Japanese government conducted a nationwide survey on the epidemiology of acute encephalopathy in Japan using a questionnaire. A total of 983 cases reportedly had acute encephalopathy during the past 3 years, 2007-2010. Among the pathogens of the preceding infection, influenza virus was the most common, followed by human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) and rotavirus. Among syndromes of acute encephalopathy, acute encephalopathy with biphasic seizures and late reduced diffusion (AESD) was the most frequent, followed by clinically mild encephalitis/encephalopathy with a reversible splenial lesion (MERS), acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE) and hemorrhagic shock and encephalopathy syndrome (HSES). Influenza virus was strongly associated with ANE and MERS, HHV-6 with AESD, and rotavirus with MERS. Mortality was high in ANE and HSES, but was low in AESD, MERS and HHV-6-associated encephalopathy. Neurologic sequelae were common in AESD and ANE, but were absent in MERS."
23211574,"Twenty years ago, the groundbreaking discovery that rearranged during transfection (RET) mutations underlie multiple endocrine neoplasia 2 (MEN2) and familial medullary thyroid cancer (FMTC) ushered in the era of personalized medicine. MEN2-associated signs, taking time to manifest, can be subtle. This study sought to clarify to what extent conventional estimates of 1:200 000-500 000 underestimate the incidence of RET mutations in the population.Included in this retrospective investigation were 333 RET carriers born between 1951 and 2000 and operated on at the largest German surgical referral center (286 carriers) or elsewhere (47 carriers).To estimate the incidence of RET mutations, the number of RET carriers born in Germany in five decades (1951-1960, 1961-1970, 1971-1980, 1981-1990, and 1991-2000) was divided by the corresponding number of German live births.Owing to improved diagnosis and capture of FMTC and MEN2 patients, minimum incidence estimates increased over time: overall from 5.0 (1951-1960) to 9.9 (1991-2000) per million live births and year (P=0.008), and by American Thyroid Association/ATA class from 1.7 to 3.7 for ATA class C (P=0.008); from 1.8 to 2.7 for ATA class A (P=0.017); from 1.5 to 2.2 for ATA class B (P=0.20); and from 0 to 1.4 for ATA class D mutations per million live births and year (P=0.008). Based on 1991-2000 incidence estimates the prevalence in Germany is ∼1:80 000 inhabitants.The molecular minimum incidence estimate of ≈1:100 000 was two- to fivefold greater than conventional estimates of 1:200 000-500 000."
7829889,"Recent studies have suggested that in Tunisia, pemphigus foliaceus is more frequent in young women than expected. To confirm these findings, we compared the incidence rates of pemphigus in Tunisia as a whole and in a large area of France. New cases of pemphigus were detected retrospectively from dermatology departments and pathology laboratories over a 6-year period and classified as pemphigus vulgaris or foliaceus according to the pathology. In France, the incidence rate was 1.7 cases per million per year (95% confidence interval 1.4 to 2.1). Pemphigus vulgaris accounted for 73% of all cases, incidence increased with age, and the female-to-male sex ratio was 1.2. The incidence rate was significantly higher in Tunisia than in France: 6.7 cases per million per year (95% confidence interval 5.8 to 7.7); pemphigus foliaceus was more frequent (61%), the female-to-male sex ratio was 4.1, and the incidence rate was higher in young women. The incidence rate was 15.5 cases per million per year for pemphigus foliaceus among women aged 25 to 34 years and was even higher in some rural areas. No case was observed among household members or in neonates, and only one case occurred in childhood. Thus, we confirmed that the epidemiology of pemphigus in Tunisia is unusual. High rates of pemphigus foliaceus among young people living in rural areas are reminiscent of Brazilian pemphigus. However, the absence of cases among genetically related household members and during childhood, and the large predominance of women, contrast with Brazilian pemphigus."

9575454,"Screening for congenital hypothyroidism was carried out by measuring thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) on dried blood spots (mean + 2SD cut off value 12 microU/ml) by fluoroimmunoassay using DELFIA kits. A total of 20,021 infants were screened, and seven cases with congenital hypothyroidism were detected, giving an incidence of congenital hypothyroidism of 1:2860 (female:male ratio 6:1). In four of seven infants with congenital hypothyroidism (57%) the mother also had thyroid disease, supporting the importance of genetic factors as a cause of congenital hypothyroidism. Transient hyperthyrotropinaemia occurred in 654 infants (recall rate 3.3%). There was a significant association of transient hyperthyrotropinaemia only with cardiac failure at birth or caesarean section (p < 0.01). Family studies showed no predisposition to thyroid diseases associated with a transient increase of TSH."
25172239,"To date, only a small number of studies have examined the epidemiology of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) on a nation-wide basis. We used French national administrative databases to analyze the nation-wide prevalence and incidence rates of SLE within the largest French health insurance scheme, which covers 86% of the population (almost 58,200,000 individuals). Patients with SLE were identified if they had full coverage for a chronic disease with a code (ICD-10th M32) in the health insurance information system, or if they had a SLE code in the hospital discharge database as a primary or secondary diagnosis in 2010. We defined incident cases as patients who had a new long-term disease diagnosis of SLE in 2010. Overall, 27,369 individuals were identified as having SLE, of whom 88% were female. The crude 2010 prevalence of identified SLE was 47.0/100,000, and the WHO age-standardized rate was 40.8/100,000. The crude 2010 annual incidence of SLE was 3.32 cases per 100,000 with peaks in females aged 30-39 years old (9.11/100,000) and in males aged 50-59 years old (1.78/100,000). Major differences in regional age-standardized prevalence rates were observed, with the highest rates in the Caribbean oversea areas (up to 126.7/100,000), and the lowest rates in north-western metropolitan territories (down to 29.6/100,000). This is the largest nation-wide population-based study of SLE patients to date, based on more than 58 million beneficiaries of the French health insurance system. These data and subsequent analyses provide guidance to both clinicians and policymakers for improving care of SLE."
20347176,"Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease that mainly targets the cholangiocytes of the interlobular bile ducts in the liver. The condition primarily affects middle-aged women. Without treatment, PBC generally progresses to cirrhosis and eventually liver failure over a period of 10-20 years. PBC is a rare disease with prevalence of less than 1/2000. PBC is thought to result from a combination of multiple genetic factors and superimposed environmental triggers. The contribution of the genetic predisposition is evidenced by the familial clustering. Several risk factors, including exposure to infectious agents and chemical xenobiotics, have been suggested. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is currently the only FDA-approved medical treatment for PBC. When administered at doses of 13-15 mg/kg/day, a majority of patients with PBC have a normal life expectancy without additional therapeutic measures. One out of three patients does not adequately respond to UDCA therapy and may need additional medical therapy and/or liver transplantation. This review summarises current knowledge on the epidemiology, ethiopathogenesis, clinical, and therapeutic aspects of PBC."
1314763,"The incidence and prevalence rates of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) in Finland between 1961 and 1990 were estimated from Finnish polyposis registry data comprising 81 FAP families, including 251 affected patients. In addition, the effect of family screening on the occurrence of colorectal carcinoma was evaluated by comparing the call up and proband groups and calculating the proportion of FAP among all patients with colorectal carcinoma. The incidence of FAP was 0.62 to 2.38 per million and the prevalence increased steadily from 0.88 to 26.3 million during the study period suggesting improving prognosis. Altogether 76 of 116 probands (65.5%) had colorectal carcinoma compared with only five of 76 call up patients (6.6%). Consequently, the life expectancy of the call up patients was significantly better than that of the probands from the age of 31 years and above. However, at most, 0.53% of all colorectal carcinomas were associated with FAP in 1966-70, and the diminishing frequency of this proportion was more a result of an increase in sporadic colorectal carcinomas in Finland than of family screening for FAP. Family screening is very effective in FAP and must always be undertaken when a new proband is diagnosed."
19095780,"To estimate the incidence of nutritional rickets and the incidence and prevalence of hereditary rickets.Population-based retrospective cohort study based on a review of medical records.Patients aged 0-14.9 years referred to or discharged from hospitals in southern Denmark from 1985 to 2005 with a diagnosis of rickets were identified by register search, and their medical records were retrieved. Patients fulfilling the diagnostic criteria of primary rickets were included.We identified 112 patients with nutritional rickets of whom 74% were immigrants. From 1995 to 2005, the average incidence of nutritional rickets in children aged 0-14.9 and 0-2.9 years was 2.9 and 5.8 per 100,000 per year respectively. Among immigrant children born in Denmark, the average incidence was 60 (0-14.9 years) per 100,000 per year. Ethnic Danish children were only diagnosed in early childhood and the average incidence in the age group 0-2.9 years declined from 5.0 to 2.0 per 100,000 per year during 1985-1994 to 1995-2005. Sixteen cases of hereditary rickets were diagnosed during the study period giving an average incidence of 4.3 per 100,000 (0-0.9 years) per year. The prevalence of hypophosphatemic rickets and vitamin D-dependent rickets type 1 was 4.8 and 0.4 per 100,000 (0-14.9 years) respectively.Nutritional rickets is rare in southern Denmark and largely restricted to immigrants, but the incidence among ethnic Danish children was unexpectedly high. Hereditary rickets is the most common cause of rickets in ethnic Danish children, but nutritional rickets is most frequent among all young children."
20871439,"BACKGROUND: The incidence of diagnosed sporadic unilateral vestibular schwannomas (VS) has increased, due primarily to more widespread access to magnetic resonance imaging. OBJECTIVE: To present updated epidemiological data on VS incidence, as well as patient age, hearing acuity, tumor size, and localization at diagnosis for the last 4 decades in an unselected population, with emphasis on developments in recent years. METHODS: From 1976 to 2008, 2283 new cases of VS were diagnosed and registered in a national database covering 5.0 to 5.5 million inhabitants. Incidence during the period, patient sex and age, data on hearing (pure tone average and speech discrimination), and tumor size at diagnosis were retrieved from the database. RESULTS: The incidence increased from 3.1 diagnosed VS per million per year in 1976 to a peak of 22.8 VS per million per year in 2004, which was followed by a decrease to 19.4 VS per million per year in 2008. Mean tumor size at diagnosis decreased from 30 mm in 1979 to 10 mm in 2008, whereas hearing acuity at diagnosis has improved over the years. CONCLUSION: After a steady increase over the last 4 decades, the incidence of vestibular schwannomas appears to have peaked and decreased in recent years, stabilizing at about 19 tumors per million per year. Whereas the sex ratio and age at diagnosis have remained grossly unchanged over the years, hearing has improved, and tumor size has decreased considerably."
17024564,"Primary immunodeficiency disorders (PID) are a heterogeneous group of diseases, characterized by an increased susceptibility to infections. A total of 930 patients (573 males and 357 females) are registered in Iranian PID Registry (IPIDR) during three decades. Predominantly antibody deficiencies were the most common (38.4%), followed by congenital defects of phagocyte number and/or function (28.3%), other well-defined immunodeficiency syndromes (17.7%), combined T- and B-cell immunodeficiencies (11.0%), complement deficiencies (2.4%), and diseases of immune dysregulation (2.3%). Common variable immunodeficiency was the most frequent disorder (20.8%), followed by chronic granulomatous disease, ataxia-telangiectasia, btk deficiency, selective IgA deficiency, and T-B-severe combined immunodeficiency. The frequency of other PID disorders was less than 50 in number (<5%). There is an increasing trend in recognition of more PID in the recent years. Construction of such registry is not only important for its epidemiological aspect but also for its role in increasing the physician's knowledge about such disorders."
20571287,"BACKGROUND: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) is the most common inherited neuropathy. CMT is classified into 2 main subgroups: a demyelinating and an axonal type. Further subdivisions within these 2 main categories exist and intermediate forms have more recently been described. Inheritance can be autosomal dominant, recessive or X-linked. CMT is associated with more than 30 loci, and about 25 causative genes have been described thus far. METHODS: We studied epidemiological, clinical and genetic characteristics of CMT in the Cypriot population. RESULTS: The prevalence of CMT in Cyprus on January 15, 2009, is estimated to be 16 per 100,000. Thirty-three families and 8 sporadic patients were ascertained. CMT was demyelinating in 52%, axonal in 33% and intermediate in 15% of the patients. Thirteen families had PMP22 duplication, 3 families had the PMP22 S22F mutation, 4 families had GJB1/Cx32 mutations, 2 families had different MPZ mutations, 1 of them novel, and 2 families had different MFN2 mutations. Nine families and 8 sporadic patients were excluded from the common CMT genes. CONCLUSION: The most frequent CMT mutation worldwide, the PMP22 duplication, is also the most frequent CMT mutation in the Cypriot population. Five out of the 8 other mutations are novel, not reported in other populations."
24780148,"The muscular dystrophies are a broad group of hereditary muscle diseases with variable severity. Population-based prevalence estimates have been reported but pooled estimates are not available. We performed a systematic review of worldwide population-based studies reporting muscular dystrophies prevalence and/or incidence using MEDLINE and EMBASE databases. The search strategy included key terms related to muscular dystrophies, incidence, prevalence and epidemiology. Two reviewers independently reviewed all abstracts, full text articles and abstracted data using standardized forms. Pooling of prevalence estimates was performed using random effect models. 1104 abstracts and 167 full text articles were reviewed. Thirty-one studies met all eligibility criteria and were included in the final analysis. The studies differed widely in their approaches to case ascertainment, resulting in significant methodological heterogeneity and varied data quality. The pooled prevalence of DMD and BMD was 4.78 (95% CI 1.94-11.81) and 1.53 (95% CI 0.26-8.94) per 100,000 males respectively. The incidence of DMD ranged from 10.71 to 27.78 per 100,000. This is the first meta-analysis of worldwide prevalence estimates for muscular dystrophies. There is a need for more epidemiological studies addressing global estimates on incidence and prevalence of muscular dystrophies, utilizing standardized diagnostic criteria as well as multiple sources of case ascertainment."
1360971,"Takayasu arteritis is a disease on which many investigations have been conducted to determine its causes, clinical features and treatment, since 1908 when it was reported by Dr. Takayasu. The first nationwide epidemiological survey on Takayasu arteritis was conducted over 3 years from 1973 through 1975 by a research group on ""aortitis syndrome"", a disease specified by the Ministry of Health and Welfare. Another nationwide survey on this disease over a period of 3 years was carried out from 1982 through 1984 by a research group focusing on ""systemic vascular lesion"", another disease specified by the Ministry of Health and Welfare. The present study reports on the combined results of these two nationwide epidemiological surveys."
1456754,"BACKGROUND AND DESIGN: The incidence and prevalence of dermatitis herpetiformis has never been formally evaluated in any area of the United States. Several northern European studies have shown prevalence rates ranging from 1.2 per 100,000 to 39.2 per 100,000. The present study was performed to evaluate the incidence and prevalence of dermatitis herpetiformis in Utah. Information from 240 patients diagnosed with dermatitis herpetiformis was compiled from hospital records throughout Utah, as well as the sole private dermatopathologist in the state, and from the university referral center of the state. Criteria for inclusion in the study were a clinical diagnosis of dermatitis herpetiformis plus granular deposition of IgA in dermal papillae by direct immunofluorescence of uninvolved skin, or histopathologic findings consistent with the disease. Clinical diagnosis and response to dapsone alone was considered insufficient for inclusion in the study. On the basis of these criteria, as well as exclusion of non-Utah residents, 188 of the original 240 patients qualified for the study. RESULTS: The prevalence of dermatitis herpetiformis in Utah in 1987 was 11.2 per 100,000. The mean incidence for the years 1978 through 1987 was 0.98 per 100,000 per year. The mean age at onset of symptoms for male patients was 40.1 years, and that for female patients was 36.2 years. The male-female ratio was 1.44:1. CONCLUSIONS: This represents the first evaluation of the incidence and prevalence of dermatitis herpetiformis in the United States. These results are similar to those of the previous studies, probably because of Utah's largely northern European ancestry. This population base, plus a much smaller than average black and Oriental population, is likely to have produced a higher incidence and prevalence in Utah than would be seen in other areas of the United States."
9306338,"BACKGROUND:This study was conducted to examine prospectively the epidemiological profile of renal disease associated with microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) and classic polyarteritis nodosa (classic PAN) in Kuwait and its clinicopathological correlation. METHODS:Between 1 January 1993 and 31 December 1996, all patients referred to Al-Amiri renal centre were subjected to renal biopsy and/or arteriography if they manifested systemic manifestations of vasculitis or had rapid or unexplained renal failure with or without proteinuria. Patients who fulfilled the criteria of MPA and classic PAN, according to the Chapel Hill Consensus Conference (CHCC), were included in the study. RESULTS:Over those 4 years, 47 patients were diagnosed as having such vasculitides, 22 of whom were Kuwaiti nationals. This gave an average annual incidence of 45 cases/million adult Kuwaiti nationals (95% CI, 27-64). Histological examination revealed necrotizing glomerulonephritis (GN) in 11 patients and crescentic GN in 13, while isolated small- and/or medium-sized-arteritis were evident in six more patients. In 10 of the remaining patients; bands of fibrosis alternating with healthy renal tissue were seen and on arteriography non-atherosclerotic stenoses, infarctions, and/or microaneurysms were evident. The remaining seven patients were diagnosed by arteriography alone, five of whom had bilateral small kidneys. Constitutional manifestations of vasculitis were present in 32 patients (68%) and multisystem involvement in 19 (40%). ANCA levels were high in 24 (55%) of the 44 patients tested and seropositivity, as an antimyeloperoxidase, was a constant finding. Only six patients presented with rapidly progressive renal failure, while 31 presented with chronic renal disease, 18 of whom had protein excretion in excess of 2 g/day. CONCLUSIONS:These findings emphasize the limited role of clinical assessment in establishing a definite diagnosis of renal vasculitis and put in question its value in retrospective analysis of causes of ESRD in different populations."
20961759,"Mutations in the FKRP (Fukutin Related Protein) gene produce a range of phenotypes including Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy Type 2I (LGMD2I). In order to investigate the prevalence, the mutation spectrum and possible genotype-phenotype correlation, we studied a cohort of Norwegian patients with LGMD2I, ascertained in a 4-year period. In this retrospective study of genetically tested patients, we identified 88 patients from 69 families, who were either homozygous or compound heterozygous for FKRP mutations. This gives a minimum prevalence of 1/54,000 and a corresponding carrier frequency of 1/116 in the Norwegian population. Seven different FKRP mutations, including three novel changes, were detected. Seventy-six patients were homozygous for the common c.826C>A mutation. These patients had later disease onset than patients who were compound heterozygous - 14.0 vs. 6.1 years. We detected substantial variability in disease severity among homozygous patients."
18221464,"National immunodeficiency registers in several countries have reported prevalence but not incidence rates for severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). The objective of this study was to document the incidence and type of SCID in Australia, the age and clinical features at presentation and short-term management. The Australian Paediatric Surveillance Unit conducts active, monthly, national surveillance of rare disorders with reporting by child-health specialists. Between May 1995 and December 2001, clinicians provided clinical and laboratory data on children newly diagnosed with SCID. Thirty-three incident cases of SCID were identified [incidence 1.8/10(5) live births per annum; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2-2.5]. Twenty-six children had classical SCID (1.45/10(5) live births; 95% CI, 0.9-2.0) and 20 (77%) of these were boys. Classical SCID was X-linked in 13 children, autosomal recessive (AR), not further classified in four, and attributed to adenosine deaminase deficiency (ADA) in four, interleukin-7 receptor alpha chain deficiency in one, Ommen syndrome in two, and Di George syndrome in two. Twenty-one (81%) received bone marrow/stem cell transplantation, three of whom died between 1 and 4 months after transplantation (two ADA deficient, one AR). Seven children had atypical SCID, five of whom died within 1-4 yr of diagnosis. Most children with SCID presented with failure to thrive and recurrent infections and there was no significant delay between presentation and diagnosis. The reported national incidence of classical SCID in Australia (1.45/10(5) or approximately 4 cases per year or 1/69,000 live births) is consistent with the rate (1.4/10(5)) previously reported in Victoria. Diagnosis is rarely delayed, and transplantation is associated with good short-term survival."
1948373,"Diastrophic dysplasia is an autosomal recessive disorder of the skeleton, characterized by disproportionate short stature, generalized joint deformities, club feet, deformed ear pinnae, and, frequently, spinal deformity and cleft palate. Diastrophic dysplasia is more common in Finland than elsewhere. We studied 101 patients with an age range from newborns to 79 years to find out the frequency and type of spinal deformities, the early signs of progressive cases, and to follow the natural history of the disease. In the follow-up study, 17 patients were under 10 years, 21 under 21 years, and 63 over 21 years of age. One-third of the patients had cervical kyphosis; in the most severe case the kyphosis was 180 degrees and led to quadriplegia during anesthesia. In three patients, cervical kyphosis resolved spontaneously before the age of 5 years. The overall frequency of scoliosis was 37%; 49% in women and 22% in men. Only 13 patients had curves greater than 50 degrees; these curves constituted distinct rotation at the apex from the early evolution of the curve. The early signs of severe curves were detectable at the age of 2 to 4 years. Only two patients were operated on because of scoliosis; one with fusion in situ and the other instrumented with the pediatric Cotrel-Dubousset instrumentation. Three patients had a brace, which did not prevent the progression of the curve. Symptoms referring to a narrow spinal canal were registered in four patients, two of which were operated on; a lumbar posterior decompressive procedure was made at adult age."
8982563,"Congenital diaphragmatic hernia is a relatively common birth defect. It affects about 1114 babies a year in the United States. Reported survival averages 60% but may be significantly lower. We do not understand the etiology of CDH. Its association with other anomalies and several distinct patterns of presentation suggest that more than one cause may exist. There is a high degree of variability in both treatment and outcomes, but no data exist to allow a rigorous comparison of the efficacy of various treatment strategies. Stratification of patients into more homogeneous groups will be a necessary prerequisite for the design of meaningful comparative trials. The incidence of the lesion prevents any single institution from accruing sufficient patients to conduct such a trial. An ad hoc multicenter study group (the Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia Study Group) has been formed for this purpose. This organization has begun collecting data with an initial goal of developing a stratification scheme. Prospective data collection should allow verification of several of the estimates made in this article. Current data make it clear that CDH represents a major cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality."
10102157,"Seasonal variation in the incidence of congenital hypothyroidism (CHT) is reported by some centres. Also, the incidence of CHT varies with ethnic origin. We report our experience in the West Midlands, England. The overall incidence of CHT among 1128 632 neonates screened over 16 years in the West Midlands was 1:2924 live births, but was increased (1:2323; p<0.05) between October and December. In the city of Birmingham between 1981 and 1991, the incidence of CHT was 1:781, 1:5540 and 1:2257 in Pakistani, Indian and North-West European children, respectively; no cases were seen in those from other ethnic groups. Consanguinity among those of Pakistani descent could account for the increased incidence within this population. Identification of the cause of seasonal variation may aid development of preventative strategies."
27784735,"Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) is a rare disease characterized by elevated plasma levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and extremely high risk of premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. HoFH is caused by mutations in several genes, including LDL receptor (LDLR), apolipoprotein B (APOB), proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), and LDL protein receptor adaptor 1 (LDLRAP1). No epidemiological studies have assessed HoFH prevalence or the clinical and molecular characteristics of this condition. Here, we aimed to characterize HoFH in Spain.Data were collected from the Spanish Dyslipidemia Registry of the Spanish Atherosclerosis Society and from all molecular diagnoses performed for familial hypercholesterolemia in Spain between 1996 and 2015 (n=16 751). Clinical data included baseline lipid levels and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events. A total of 97 subjects were identified as having HoFH-of whom, 47 were true homozygous (1 for APOB, 5 for LDLRAP1, and 41 for LDLR), 45 compound heterozygous for LDLR, 3 double heterozygous for LDLR and PSCK9, and 2 double heterozygous for LDLR and APOB. No PSCK9 homozygous cases were identified. Two variants in LDLR were identified in 4.8% of the molecular studies. Over 50% of patients did not meet the classical HoFH diagnosis criteria. The estimated HoFH prevalence was 1:450 000. Compared with compound heterozygous cases, true homozygous cases showed more aggressive phenotypes with higher LDL-C and more atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events.HoFH frequency in Spain was higher than expected. Clinical criteria would underestimate the actual prevalence of individuals with genetic HoFH, highlighting the importance of genetic analysis to improve familial hypercholesterolemia diagnosis accuracy."
23425518,"Transthyretin amyloidosis is a progressive and eventually fatal disease primarily characterized by sensory, motor, and autonomic neuropathy and/or cardiomyopathy. Given its phenotypic unpredictability and variability, transthyretin amyloidosis can be difficult to recognize and manage. Misdiagnosis is common, and patients may wait several years before accurate diagnosis, risking additional significant irreversible deterioration. This article aims to help physicians better understand transthyretin amyloidosis--and, specifically, familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy--so they can recognize and manage the disease more easily and discuss it with their patients. We provide guidance on making a definitive diagnosis, explain methods for disease staging and evaluation of disease progression, and discuss symptom mitigation and treatment strategies, including liver transplant and several pharmacotherapies that have shown promise in clinical trials."
17245510,"INTRODUCTION: Anencephaly is a neural tube defect that is incompatible with life. Previous studies have suggested that there is a racial predilection for this condition. However, local studies have not shown a statistical difference between the races. The aim of this study is to examine the incidence and the demographical trend of this condition over a ten-year period. METHODS: Data of patients with anencephaly born from 1993 to 2002 were retrieved from the National Birth Defect Registry and analysed. RESULTS: There were a total of 267 cases of anencephaly in the ten-year period from 1993 to 2002, giving an overall incidence of 0.58 per 1,000 livebirths, with a decreasing trend noted. The incidence was highest among the Malay population, compared with the Chinese population (p-value equals 0.03) and other races. Abortion rates have also increased over the years, causing a reduction in livebirth rates for this condition. CONCLUSION: The overall incidence and birth incidence of anencephaly has seen a decreasing trend over the last ten years, with the latter being contributed significantly by early termination. More studies should be done to ascertain if improved folate supplementation has contributed to the drop in overall incidence. The incidence in the Malay population is significantly higher than other races and this phenomenon should be further examined."
18698630,"There have been no large population-based studies of the prevalence of achondroplasia and thanatophroic dysplasia in the United States. This study compared data from seven population-based birth defects monitoring programs in the United States. We also present data on the association between older paternal age and these birth defects, which has been described in earlier studies. The prevalence of achondroplasia ranged from 0.36 to 0.60 per 10,000 livebirths (1/27,780-1/16,670 livebirths). The prevalence of thanatophoric dysplasia ranged from 0.21 to 0.30 per 10,000 livebirths (1/33,330-1/47,620 livebirths). In Texas, fathers that were 25-29, 30-34, 35-39, and > or =40 years of age had significantly increased rates of de novo achondroplasia among their offspring compared with younger fathers. The adjusted prevalence odds ratios were 2.8 (95% CI; 1.2, 6.7), 2.8 (95% CI; 1.0, 7.6), 4.9 (95% CI; 1.7, 14.3), and 5.0 (95% CI; 1.5, 16.1), respectively. Using the same age categories, the crude prevalence odds ratios for de novo cases of thanatophoric dysplasia in Texas were 5.8 (95% CI; 1.7, 9.8), 3.9 (95% CI; 1.1, 6.7), 6.1 (95% CI; 1.6, 10.6), and 10.2 (95% CI; 2.6, 17.8), respectively. These data suggest that thanatophoric dysplasia is one-third to one-half as frequent as achondroplasia. The differences in the prevalence of these conditions across monitoring programs were consistent with random fluctuation. Birth defects monitoring programs may be a good source of ascertainment for population-based studies of achondroplasia and thanatophoric dysplasia, provided that diagnoses are confirmed by review of medical records."
18587690,"BACKGROUND: since 1999 data from pulmonary hypertension (PH) patients from all PH centres in Switzerland were prospectively collected. We analyse the epidemiological aspects of these data. METHODS: PH was defined as a mean pulmonary artery pressure of >25 mm Hg at rest or >30 mm Hg during exercise. Patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), PH associated with lung diseases, PH due to chronic thrombotic and/or embolic disease (CTEPH), or PH due to miscellaneous disorders were registered. Data from adult patients included between January 1999 and December 2004 were analysed. RESULTS: 250 patients were registered (age 58 +/- 16 years, 104 (41%) males). 152 patients (61%) had PAH, 73 (29%) had CTEPH and 18 (7%) had PH associated with lung disease. Patients <50 years (32%) were more likely to have PAH than patients >50 years (76% vs. 53%, p <0.005). Twenty-four patients (10%) were lost to followup, 58 patients (26%) died and 150 (66%) survived without transplantation or thrombendarterectomy. Survivors differed from patients who died in the baseline six-minute walking distance (400 m [300-459] vs. 273 m [174-415]), the functional impairment (NYHA class III/IV 86% vs. 98%), mixed venous saturation (63% [57-68] vs. 56% [50-61]) and right atrial pressure (7 mm Hg [4-11] vs. 11 mm Hg [4-18]). DISCUSSION: PH is a disease affecting adults of all ages. The management of these patients in specialised centres guarantees a high quality of care. Analysis of the registry data could be an instrument for quality control and might help identify weak points in assessment and treatment of these patients."
8333247,"One hundred four cases of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) in 52 families were identified within a defined area in northern Sweden corresponding to a prevalence rate of 20.1 cases per 100,000 (Dec 31 1991) for all subtypes. The prevalence of CMT type I was 16.2 per 100,000. The distribution of cases was not uniform. The prevalence rate is compared with previous prevalence studies focusing on Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease or hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy (HMSN). Three patients were classified as the distal spinal muscular atrophy type of CMT and one patient was not possible to classify. For seventy-five patients, available to clinical examination within the study, data were collected as to age at onset, symptoms, clinical findings and degree of disability."
23918458,"Although Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS, OMIM #130650) is the most common genetic overgrowth disorder, data on its epidemiology are scanty and the estimates of its occurrence show wide variability. The aim of this study is to assess its prevalence in Piedmont Region (Italy). We included in the study all patients diagnosed with BWS born in Piedmont from 1997 to 2009 through a search in the Italian Registry for Rare Diseases. This source was further validated with data from the network of Regional Clinical Genetics services and surveys in extra-regional Clinical Genetics centres, laboratories and the Italian BWS patients association. All cases were further ascertained through physical exam, medical history and specific molecular tests. The search identified 46 clear-cut cases of BWS born across the 13-year period, providing a prevalence of 1:10 340 live births (95% confidence interval 1:7,752-13,698 live births). Among the 41 patients who underwent molecular tests, 70.7% were positive, showing hypomethylation of the IC2 imprinting center (29.3%), paternal chromosome 11 uniparental disomy (pUPD11, 24.4%), IC1 hypermethylation (14.6%), CDKN1c mutation (2.4%), whereas 29.3% had negative molecular tests. The study provides an approximate BWS prevalence of 1:10,000 live birth, the highest reported to date."
19405011,"Behçet's disease (BD) is a rare, multisystem inflammatory disorder of unknown cause. Although well-documented in Eastern populations, epidemiologic data is scarce in North American countries. Here we describe the incidence and prevalence of BD in Olmsted County, Minnesota over 45 years.We identified an incidence cohort of subjects age >/=18 years who had a clinical diagnosis of and/or fulfilled the International Study Group (ISG) criteria for BD from January 1, 1960 to January 1, 2005. Age- and sex-specific incidence and prevalence were estimated and age- and sex-adjusted to the 2000 US total population.The study population was comprised of 13 subjects with BD; 11 fulfilled ISG criteria between 1960 and 2005. Mean +/- SD age was 31 +/- 9 years, and 69% were white. Point prevalence in 2000 was 5.2 per 100,000 population (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.64-9.84). The overall annual age- and sex-adjusted incidence of BD was 0.38 per 100,000 population (95% CI 0.17-0.59), with a higher incidence in women (0.51 per 100,000; 95% CI 0.17-0.84) than in men (0.26 per 100,000; 95% CI 0.004-0.52). Dermatologic lesions included oral ulcers (100%), genital ulcers (62%), erythema nodosum (46%), and papulopustular lesions (54%). Ocular lesions, vascular complications, and central nervous system involvement were present in 8, 3, and 3 subjects, respectively.Our study shows an overall incidence of 0.38 per 100,000 population, which is comparable with other Western populations. The prevalence of 5.2 per 100,000 population is similar to estimates reported in Western countries, but lower than that in countries along the Silk Road."
15816826,"Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS) is a blistering skin disorder caused by Staphylococcus aureus. The ""Dokumentationszentrum schwerer Hautreaktionen"", a unique population-based registry for severe skin reactions, included SSSS during a time period of 2 y in Germany. Statistical calculations indicated a low overall incidence between 0.09 and 0.13 cases per 1 million inhabitants per year with 95% confidence interval of [0-4]. The age distribution showed two clusters; one in young children and one in adults. The mortality rate was much lower in children than in adults. Young age was the main risk factor, whereas immunosuppression and consumptive infectious disease were the detected risk factors in adults."
22925539,"OBJECTIVES: To review clinical and epidemiologic data of orofacial clefts and to evaluate the efficacy and the impact of prenatal diagnosis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A population-based retrospective study was carried out on data from the Congenital Malformations of Alsace Registry (France) between 1995 and 2006. RESULTS: A total of 321 orofacial clefts were recorded (overall prevalence, 2.1 per 1000), divided into cleft lip (CL) or cleft lip palate (CLP) (204 cases) and cleft palate (117 cases). The cleft lip and cleft lip palate CL±P sex-ratio was 1.87, whereas the CP sex-ratio was 1. CLs were more often unilateral than CLPs (79% versus 59%). CLs were unilateral in 79% of the cases (60/76), bilateral in 20% of the cases (15/76), and median in 1% (1/76); 55% of the unilateral CLs were right and 45% were left. CLPs were unilateral in 59% of the cases (76/128), bilateral in 39% of the cases (50/128), and median in 2% (2/128); 45% of the unilateral CLPs were right and 55% were left. The 117 CPs were divided into 50 clefts of the total palate (43%) and 67 clefts of the posterior palate (57%); 25 cases (21%) of Pierre Robin sequence were collected. Sixty-six percent of CL±P (134/204) were associated with other congenital anomalies, including chromosome abnormality in 31 cases and identified monogenic syndrome or association in 12 cases. The most frequent chromosome abnormalities were 16 cases of trisomy 13 and 7 cases of trisomy 18. No cases of 22q11.2 microdeletion or duplication were detected among CL±P. Monogenic syndromes were identified in 6% (12/204) of CL±P cases: Van der Woude syndrome (2 cases); CHARGE syndrome (2 cases); ectrodactyly, ectodermal dysplasia, and cleft/lip palate (EEC) syndrome (2 cases); branchiooculofacial (BOF) syndrome (1 case); Treacher-Collins syndrome (1 case); Nager syndrome (1 case); Goldenhar syndrome (1 case); holoprosencephaly spectrum (1 case); and Meckel syndrome (1 case). Forty-two percent of CPs (49/117) were associated with other congenital anomalies; chromosome abnormality was identified in 12 cases and monogenic syndrome was diagnosed in 14 cases. The most frequent chromosome abnormality was 22q11 microdeletion (5 cases). Monogenic syndromes were recognized in 12% of the CP cases (14/117): fragile X syndrome (2 cases), Meckel syndrome (2 cases), Orofaciodigital syndrome type I (OFD1) (1 case), Stickler syndrome (1 case), Larsen syndrome (1 case), Kniest syndrome (1 case), Cornelia de Lange syndrome (1 case), thanatophoric dysplasia (1 case), other unknown bone chondrodysplasia (1 case), Fryns syndrome (1 case), fetal akinesia sequence (1 case), and Silver-Russel syndrome (1 case). Fifty-two percent of CL cases (106/204) were prenatally diagnosed. An increasing tendency was observed between the 1995-2000 and 2001-2006 periods with a detection rate increasing from 47% to 56%. During the whole period, only 1 case of CP was prenatally diagnosed. Eighty-two percent of all cases (263/321) were livebirths; 8 stillbirths were reported (2%); 50 syndromic or associated cases (16%) led to medical abortion (no termination of pregnancy was performed for isolated cleft). CONCLUSION: Orofacial clefts are a frequent malformation with a total prevalence of 2.1 per 1000 total births. Sonbographic prenatal diagnosis of orofacial clefts remains difficult with a mean detection rate about 50% for CL±P and is extremely rare for CP. Associated malformations and genetic syndromes are frequent and require a systematic survey. This study also highlights the different pathogenic background of CL±P compared to CP, regarding the sex-ratio and the proportion and type of associated malformations."
9137324,"Through register research 21 new cases (10 male, 11 female) of polymyositis/dermatomyositis during the period 1984-1993 in the county of Gävleborg, Sweden, were identified. The case records were studied retrospectively. Inclusion body myositis was found in three cases and overlap syndrome in seven cases. Three patients had associated malignant disease. The annual incidence was estimated to 7.6 cases/million people. The clinical features are described. 19 patients were given steroid treatment, and azathioprin was the most used additive immunosuppressive drug. All patients could be followed for at least two years, and during this period three patients died (all of cancer disease). Remission and withdrawal of medication were achieved in five cases. The results of the study corresponds to previous investigations with similar design."
15921174,"OBJECTIVE:To evaluate the results of the screening program for congenital hypothyroidism (CH) in the Greek Cypriot population. CHILDREN AND METHODS:During 1990-2000, 109,532 neonates were screened by TSH determination. Permanent CH was proven with biochemical findings after discontinuation of treatment for scintigraphy at the age of 3 years. RESULTS:Permanent CH was diagnosed in 61 infants, incidence 1/1800, with female/male ratio 2.05/1. The most common clinical findings were omphalocele (61%), large anterior fontanelles (49%) and edema of the eyelids (34%). The more delayed the bone maturation, the lower were initial T4 levels (p = 0.005). Bone maturation tended to be more advanced in thyroid hypoplasia and more delayed in thyroid agenesis (p = 0.049). Scintigraphy of the thyroid with TC99 revealed ectopia in 38%, thyroid agenesis in 36%, thyroid hypoplasia in 24% and dyshormonogenesis in 1.7%. Children with transient CH had significantly lower T4 and higher TSH values initially compared to those with permanent CH after birth; initial TSH level, however, failed to predict the nature of CH. Children with transient CH required less thyroxine dosage to maintain normal thyroid hormone levels and they had a normal thyroid gland on scintigraphy. The TSH level was normalized before the age of 2 months with a starting L-thyroxine dose of 10 microg/kg/daily. CONCLUSIONS:The incidence of primary CH in Greek Cypriots is 1/1800 live births. The most common etiology is thyroid dysgenesis. Initial T4 levels correlated with the degree of skeletal maturation and the etiology. Initial TSH level, although lower in children with transient CH, could not predict the nature of CH."
21167500,"OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review to assist the United States Secretary of Health and Human Services Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children (SACHDNC) to determine whether Hemoglobin H screening should be included among the core recommended conditions for newborn screening. STUDY DESIGN: We identified 21 articles in MEDLINE from 1989 to March 2010 that provided evidence regarding screening, treatment, and outcomes associated with Hemoglobin H disease. RESULTS: In California, newborn screening has identified 9 cases per 100 000 of deletional hemoglobin H disease and 0.6 cases per 100 000 of nondeletional hemoglobin H disease. Five cases of hemoglobin Bart's hydrops fetalis syndrome were also identified in over ten years of screening for Hemoglobin H disease. Although Hemoglobin H disease is associated with a wide range of morbidity, no studies were found that evaluated the benefits of early identification and treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The SACHDNC found the data insufficient to recommend that states adopt newborn screening for Hemoglobin H disease."
21860251,"BACKGROUND: To determine the annual incidence rate and clinical features of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in Møre and Romsdal County, Norway, in the 20-year period from 1988 to 2007. METHODS: We recruited ALS patients retrospectively from the patient database of the two neurological departments in Møre and Romsdal County, Norway. The patients were identified by use of the international classification code for diseases. We recorded gender, age, municipality, symptoms, clinical signs, time from onset to diagnosis and death. RESULTS: 105 patients met the inclusion criteria. The crude annual incidence was 2.17 per 100,000 for the period 1988-2007. Gender-specific incidence for men was 2.32 per 100,000, and for women 2.03 per 100,000. Mean age at symptom onset was 66.8 ± 10.5 years. Mean interval from onset of symptoms to diagnosis was 13.5 ± 11.0 months, and mean survival time from diagnosis was 18.0 ± 22.0 months. Prevalence rate estimated on December 31, 2007 was 4.06 per 100,000. CONCLUSION: The present study shows an annual incidence of ALS of similar magnitude to the previous studies from the Nordic countries during the past years. The short survival time corroborates prior studies, and is stable throughout the two studied decades."
23518150,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the thyroid cancer incidence trends and geographical patterns in the Latina Province of Lazio, Italy using the population-based cancer registry. METHODS: We extracted from the Latina cancer registry all cases of thyroid cancer from 1997 to 2006. Cases were classified according to morphological type and diameter. Data for diagnostic procedures for Latina Province residents from 2001 to 2006 were extracted from the regional outpatient procedures information system. RESULTS: A total of 982 cases were diagnosed, for a standardized incidence of 8.3 and of 27.9 per 100,000 in males (n, 220) and in females (n, 762), respectively. The annual percent change (APC) was +16.7% (95% CI +7.2, +27.2) and +10.5% (95% CI +6.5, +14.6) in males and females, respectively. The increase was mostly due to papillary (n, 759) and small (≤20 mm) cancers (n, 617), with no difference by age (<45 years; n, 431). The APC of neck ultrasound performed was +8.7% (95% CI +0.1, +18.1) and +9.0% (95% CI +1.1, +17.4) and that of biopsy/cytology was +17.0% (95% CI +13.0, +21.3) and +16.6% (95% CI +6.2, +28.1) in men and women, respectively. The geographic pattern of biopsy/cytology was similar to that of cancer incidence but not to that of neck ultrasound. CONCLUSIONS: In Latina, the increase in thyroid cancer incidence was more rapid than in the rest of Italy, particularly for types with a good prognosis. While tumor size and histotype suggest an increase in detection instead of an increase in disease occurrence, data on diagnostic procedure reimbursements cannot provide an explanation."

A population-based epidemiological analysis of sporadic ataxias in the Japanese population was described. The prevalence rate of SCAs in the Japanese population is estimated to be 18.5/100,000. Sporadic SCAs account for 67.2% of total SCAs including hereditary SCAs, with olivopontocerebellar atrophy (OPCA) being the most common form sporadic ataxia (64.7%). The natural history analysis conducted on the basis of International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS) showed that only 33% of patients with OPCA were able to walk at least with one stick 4-5 years after the onset of OPCA, which is much less than that of patients with cortical cerebellar atrophy (CCA). Similarly, 43% of patients with OPCA were able to stand alone 4-5 years after the onset, while 76% of patients with CCA were able to stand alone at the same disease duration. A population-based epidemiological analysis should provide essential information on the natural history of SCAs."
1558973,"No reports of the incidence rates for primary systemic amyloidosis (AL) have come to our attention. Records of all residents of Olmstead County, Minnesota, with a diagnosis of amyloidosis were obtained from the Mayo Clinic and its affiliated hospitals, as well as other medical groups that might have seen local patients for the period January 1, 1950 to December 31, 1989. Twenty-one patients fulfilled the criteria for the diagnosis of AL. The median age was 73.5 years, and 62% were men. In all but one patient the diagnosis was made ante mortem. The clinical data of the 21 patients were similar to those referral patients with AL seen at Mayo Clinic. Immunohistochemical stains were positive for monoclonal light chains in the amyloid deposits in 15 of the 21 cases. In six cases, tissue was not available for immunohistochemical studies. Three of the six patients without immunohistochemical stains had a free monoclonal lambda light chain in the urine, and the other three had a monoclonal serum protein. Immunoelectrophoresis/immunofixation detected a monoclonal (M)-protein in the serum of 16 of 17 patients tested. A monoclonal light chain was found in the urine of 10 of 15 patients. The overall sex- and age-adjusted rate per million person-years was 6.1 from 1950 to 1969 and 10.5 from 1970 to 1989. The similarity of these rates suggests no significant increase over time."
16765131,"Reports from case series have estimated the incidence of peripartum cardiomyopathy (PC) at 1 case/1,485 live births to 1 case/15,000 live births and probable mortality rates of 7% to 60%. The objective of this study was to produce the first population-based study of the incidence, mortality, and risk factors for PC. The National Hospital Discharge Survey was used. Discharge information was available for 3.6 million patient discharges from 1990 to 2002. There were an estimated 16,296 cases of PC from 1990 to 2002. During this period, there were 51,966,560 live births in the United States. Thus, the incidence of PC was 1 case/3,189 live births. There was a trend toward an increase in PC incidence during the study period, with an estimate for the years 2000 to 2002 of 1 case/2,289 live births. The in-hospital mortality rate was 1.36% (95% confidence interval 0% to 10.2%). The total mortality rate was 2.05% (95% confidence interval 0.29% to 10.8%). Patients with PC were older (mean age 29.7 vs 26.9 years), were more likely to be black (32.2% vs 15.7%), and had a higher incidence of pregnancy associated hypertensive disorders (22.5% vs 5.87%) compared with national data. In conclusion, the incidence of PC is relatively uncommon, occurring at an average frequency of 1 case/3,189 live births from 1990 to 2002. The estimated mortality of 1.36% to 2.05% (95% confidence interval 0.29% to 10.8%) is less than previously reported from most case series."
24188357,"In Colorado, USA, diagnoses coded as toxic shock syndrome (TSS) constituted 27.3% of infectious shock cases during 1993-2006. The incidence of staphylococcal TSS did not change significantly overall or in female patients 10-49 years of age but increased for streptococcal TSS. TSS may be underrecognized among all ages and both sexes."
9608092,"INTRODUCTION: We present the study of the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of Brachmann-de Lange syndrome in our population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this study we present the analysis of 13 cases of Brachmann-de Lange syndrome identified among 24,696 infants with congenital defects registered by the Spanish Collaborative Study of Congenital Malformations (ECEMC) between April 1976 and June 1996. RESULTS: The minimum estimation of the prevalence in our population is 0.97 per 100,000 live births. We have epidemiologically confirmed the presence of intrauterine growth retardation and have observed that parental ages tend to be relatively young. We have observed a wide range of clinical expression of this syndrome. One hundred percent of our cases have limb reduction defects, followed in frequency by craniofacial alterations (84.62%), abnormal hair distribution (76.92%) and genital defects (69.23%). Upper limbs are predominantly affected and one case of diaphragmatic hernia is worth mentioning. We underline the importance of the differential diagnosis with Fryns'syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: The cases studied correspond to the most severe form of the syndrome, reason for which the prevalence is a minimal estimate. However, the mild forms of the syndrome are more frequent and it is important to consider that the face, especially the form of the eyebrow, could be a good guide for the diagnosis of mild forms of the syndrome."
15557784,"Rare diseases are often associated with uninformed medical decisions and poorly executed treatments because of inexperience of the physicians. Desmoplastic small round-cell tumor is a rare disease that is a form of peritoneal surface malignancy usually affecting young males, with a mean survival of 29 months. In order to begin to build a more knowledgeable clinical pathway all 7 patients treated at the Washington Hospital Center were studied and compared to patients described in the medical literature. Clinical and pathological data, tumor distribution, cytoreductive surgery, completeness of cytoreduction and survival were recorded and analyzed. The first most common symptoms were pain, increased abdominal girth and palpable abdominal mass in our patients and in the literature review. The overall survival did not improve with cytoreductive surgery plus intraperitoneal chemotherapy (mean survival 32 months); however, 2 long-term survivors who responded to systemic chemotherapy of 55 and 101 months were recorded. The latter may be the longest survivor reported in the literature. No consistent response to chemotherapy was observed in our patients or in any literature review. Complete surgical removal of this malignancy did not correlate with survival in our patients. The absence of improved survival of our aggressively treated patients as compared to the literature was thought to be a consequence of an advanced stage of the disease. A new comprehensive approach that uses complete clearing of cancer by surgery and perioperative systemic and perioperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy as early as is possible in the natural history of the disease emerged as goals for future management."
8766141,"Limb reduction defects (LRD) gained special attention after the thalidomide tragedy in 1962. LRD are common congenital malformations which present as obvious congenital anomalies recognized at birth. Therefore it might be assumed that they are well documented. However classification of LRDs is disputed as the identification of the exact site of the reduction(s) is hindered by imprecise information. This study was undertaken in 6 European countries to evaluate the use of the new classification proposed by EUROCAT for the epidemiologic and genetic study of LRD. The total number of births including livebirths, still-births and terminations, surveyed during 7 years by the 6 registries of congenital anomalies participating to this study was 611.150. The total prevalence of LRD was 7.06 per 10.000 births including the following categories prevalence : terminal transverse, 3.97, longitudinal, 1.75, proximal-intercalary, 0.10, split hand/foot 0.54 and multiple types 0.70. The prevalence of LRD was statistically higher in Basque Country, Odense, Strasbourg and Groningen than in Belfast and Emilia Romagna. Six per cent of the cases were chromosomal anomalies, including 15 trisomies 18 out of 26 cases, 49.5% (201 cases) were isolated LRD and 50.5% (206 cases) had other major non LRD associated malformations. Sex ratio and maternal age were not statistically different between regions and from the normal population. Multiply malformed with LRD had statistically significantly lower birthweight and lower gestational age than isolated cases with LRD, where available prenatal detection of LRD was higher in multiple malformed children with LRD than in isolated cases, 19.9% and 4.8% respectively. The precurrence risk was 1 in 37."
3921756,"In our survey, 101 infants and children with cystinosis were registered in the Federal Republic of Germany. Ninety-five patients showed the infantile type of cystinosis, five the adolescent type and one possibly the adult type. The minimum incidence rate of infantile and adolescent cystinosis in the FRG was 1 patient per 179 000 live-births. In contrast to other countries, cystinotic patients were evenly distributed in the FRG. Patients with cystinosis originated more frequently from rural communities than from large cities. Before 1968 most patients died before reaching terminal renal failure, usually due to uncontrolled disturbances of water and electrolyte metabolism. Since 1976 the causes of death other than uraemia have been rare and most patients with terminal renal failure have entered a renal replacement program."
23252366,"PURPOSE:Most published data on infants presenting with epilepsy originate from hospital/specialist clinic settings and may therefore not be representative of the general population. We carried out a population-based study to estimate the incidence of epilepsy onset in infants, to characterize the range of phenotypes and associated structural brain abnormalities, and to determine whether specific epilepsy diagnoses could be established at onset. METHODS:Children between 1 and 24 months of age with new-onset epilepsy were ascertained over 13 months from the residents in 15 boroughs of North London. Classification based on clinical information, electroencephalography (EEG), and neuroimaging data was undertaken independently by two pediatric neurologists. Neuroimages were reviewed by two neuroradiologists blinded to clinical details. KEY FINDINGS:A total of 57 children were enrolled giving an ascertainment-adjusted incidence of 70.1 (95% CI [56.3, 88.5])/100,000 children ≤ 2 years of age/year (ascertainment 76%). The incidence was highest among Asian children. An electroclinical syndrome was identified in 24 (42%) cases of which 21 were epileptic encephalopathies. Magnetic resonance (MR) images of 51 cases (89% of the total cohort) were reviewed. These demonstrated positive findings in 37 (72%) of 51 cases, of which 26 (51%) of 51 were etiologically relevant, and included developmental malformations in 11 (21%) of 51. SIGNIFICANCE:In a population setting infantile onset epilepsy presents mostly with complex phenotypes commonly associated with structural brain abnormalities. Routine MR imaging at presentation is therefore justified. However, identification of specific electroclinical syndromes remains difficult at onset."
23286747,"Our objective was to determine the incidence and clinical-epidemiological characteristics of an ALS cohort patient in Catalonia (Spain). We conducted a population based registry for a three-year period (1999-2001) in Catalonia (6,361,365 inhabitants) using several sources of information. The original El Escorial diagnostic criteria (1994) for ALS were applied for the classification of patients. New cases diagnosed between 1 January 1999 and 31 December 2001 were 215 (118 males and 97 females), with an annual crude incidence rate of 1.4/100,000 (95% CI 1.3-1.8). This rate showed a peak age between 75 and 79 years. The incidence rate was 1.6 (95% CI 1.5-2.2) in males and 1.2 (95% CI 1.1-1.7) in females. Prevalence at the end of the period was 5.4/100,000 of the total population. Median age at onset was 64.3 years. Onset of symptoms was bulbar or generalized in 38% of cases. Mean disease duration at diagnosis was 11.0 months. Median time of survival from onset was 30.8 months. In conclusion, ALS incidence in Catalonia is within the range of other countries across Europe with different geographic, environmental and socioeconomic situations. However, as in other studies conducted in the Mediterranean area, Catalonia incidence is in the lower range of rates in Europe."
8533810,"The incidence rate and the death rate of cystic fibrosis (CF) in Japan were analyzed using Japanese Vital Statistics data for the period 1969-1992. The incidence rate was 3.1 per million live births during the period 1969-1980, where the rate was 1.5 times higher in rural than urban areas. The proportion of deaths from CF under 5 years old was 82% and under 20 years old was 94%. Overall death rates of CF per million population under 20 years of age were 0.15 for males and 0.10 for females, the difference being significant; the death rate was also significantly higher in males (2.2 per million) than females (1.3) in the first year of life. The death rate decreased from the period 1969-1973 to the period 1989-1992 for males. There were geographical variations in the incidence and the death rates among nine districts. These rates of CF were observed with the highest being in Hokkaido and the lowest in Okinawa. The death rate from CF was negatively correlated with the average temperature. The death rate was higher in rural than in urban areas during the period 1969-1985. The mean age at death from CF was 3 years for both sexes during the period 1969-1985, the value has been increased since 1979."
25084775,"The number of studies on the incidence of pituitary adenomas (PAs) is limited. The aim of this study was to evaluate the standardised incidence rate (SIR) of PAs in western Sweden.Data from adult patients diagnosed with PAs in 2001-2011, living in the Västra Götaland County, were collected from the Swedish Pituitary Registry (SPR). In addition, medical records on all patients diagnosed with PAs at the six hospitals in the region were reviewed. In total, 592 patients were included in the study.Age-SIR, given as rate/100 000 inhabitants (95% CI), was calculated using the WHO 2000 standard population as a reference.The total SIR for PAs was 3.9/100 000 (3.6-4.3); 3.3/100 000 (2.9-3.7) for men and 4.7/100 000 (4.1-5.3) for women. In men, SIR increased with age, while in women SIR peaked at 25-34 years, mainly due to prolactinomas. Non-functioning PA (NFPA) was the most common PA (54%, 1.8/100 000 (1.6-2.0)) followed by prolactinomas (32%, 1.6/100 000 (1.3-1.9)), acromegaly (9%, 0.35/100 000 (0.25-0.45)), Cushing's disease (4%, 0.18/100 000 (0.11-0.25)) and TSH-producing PA (0.7%, 0.03/100 000 (0.00-0.05)). The proportion of macroadenomas for NFPA was 82%, prolactinomas 37%, GH-producing PA 77%, ACTH-producing PA 28% and TSH-producing PA 100%. The lifetime risk for PAs was 0.27% (0.24-0.31) in men and 0.29% (0.26-0.33) in women.This study provides a reliable estimate on the overall incidence of PAs and confirms an increased incidence of PAs compared with studies conducted in the pre-magnetic resonance imaging era. The lower proportion of prolactinomas compared with previous studies is probably explained by the different criteria used."
23591685,"Haemoglobin C (HbC) is one of the commonest structural haemoglobin variants in human populations. Although HbC causes mild clinical complications, its diagnosis and genetic counselling are important to prevent inheritance with other haemoglobinopathies. Little is known about its contemporary distribution and the number of newborns affected. We assembled a global database of population surveys. We then used a Bayesian geostatistical model to create maps of HbC frequency across Africa and paired our predictions with high-resolution demographics to calculate heterozygous (AC) and homozygous (CC) newborn estimates and their associated uncertainty. Data were too sparse outside Africa for this methodology to be applied. The highest frequencies were found in West Africa but HbC was commonly found in other parts of the continent. The expected annual numbers of AC and CC newborns in Africa were 672,117 (interquartile range (IQR): 642,116-705,163) and 28,703 (IQR: 26,027-31,958), respectively. These numbers are about two times previous estimates."
19897550,"The current study aimed to investigate incidence, prevalence and regional distribution of sarcoidosis in Switzerland with respect to environmental exposures. All sarcoidosis patients hospitalised between 2002 and 2005 were identified from the Swiss hospital statistics from the Swiss Federal Office for Statistics (Neuchâtel, Switzerland). Regional exposure characteristics included the regional distribution of different industrial sectors, agriculture and air quality. Co-inertia analysis, as well as a generalised linear model, was applied. The prevalence of ""ever-in-life"" diagnosed sarcoidosis, currently active sarcoidosis and sarcoidosis requiring hospitalisation was 121 (95% CI 93-149), 44 (95% CI 34-54) and 16 (95% CI 10-22) per 100,000 inhabitants, respectively. The mean annual incidence of sarcoidosis was 7 (95% CI 5-11) per 100,000 inhabitants. The regional workforce in the metal industry, water supply, air transport factories and the area of potato production, artificial meadows (grassland) and bread grains were positively associated with the frequency of sarcoidosis. The prevalence of sarcoidosis was higher than assumed based on former international estimates. Higher frequency was found in regions with metal industry and intense agriculture, especially production of potatoes, bread grains and artificial meadows."
16960922,"OBJECTIVE: Studies of Wegener's granulomatosis (WG) since the late 1980s indicate a probable increase in incidence of unknown cause and significance, possibly related to antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) testing. To extend these observations and to include calendar periods before ANCA was introduced, we assessed time trends in the incidence of WG in Sweden in the period 1975-2001. METHODS: In the population-based Swedish Inpatient Register, we identified 1938 individuals diagnosed with WG in the period 1975-2001, and calculated the annual age and sex adjusted incidences. RESULTS: The incidence increased from 0.33 (95% CI 0.28-0.39) in the period 1975-85 to 0.77 (95% CI 0.69-0.85) in 1986-90, to 1.19 (95% CI 1.12-1.26) in 1991-2001, resulting in a mean incidence of 0.78 (95% CI 0.74-0.82). CONCLUSION: WG displays a strong temporal trend. While the increase coincides to some extent with the implementation of ANCA testing, suggestive of increased disease recognition, ANCA testing remains an incomplete explanation as increasing incidences were noted before as well as after their introduction."
20880124,"Using the Northern Ireland Huntington disease (HD) register, the number of prospectively recorded predictive tests was analysed over a 20-year period. Two hundred and twelve patients completed predictive testing. Ninety-two (43%) received mutation-positive results and 119 (56%) mutation negative. There was one intermediate allele result. There was no significant gender difference. One hundred and eighty affected cases confirmed by molecular genetic testing were alive on 1 January 2001. The uptake of predictive testing in the entire HD 50% at-risk population in 2001 was calculated by three methods giving a range of 12.3-14.6%. Uptake after 20 years was estimated to be 14.7%. The minimum prevalence of affected HD cases was calculated as 10.6/100,000 in 2001. The total uptake of predictive testing was calculated and it suggests that a substantial number of at-risk patients do not come forward for testing until symptomatic. Pre-symptomatic testing for this late-onset condition with no present treatment, and limited management options, still presents challenges for families."
16456139,"RATIONALE: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is an orphan disease for which the trend is for management in designated centers with multidisciplinary teams working in a shared-care approach. OBJECTIVE: To describe clinical and hemodynamic parameters and to provide estimates for the prevalence of patients diagnosed for PAH according to a standardized definition. METHODS: The registry was initiated in 17 university hospitals following at least five newly diagnosed patients per year. All consecutive adult (> or = 18 yr) patients seen between October 2002 and October 2003 were to be included. MAIN RESULTS: A total of 674 patients (mean +/- SD age, 50 +/- 15 yr; range, 18-85 yr) were entered in the registry. Idiopathic, familial, anorexigen, connective tissue diseases, congenital heart diseases, portal hypertension, and HIV-associated PAH accounted for 39.2, 3.9, 9.5, 15.3, 11.3, 10.4, and 6.2% of the population, respectively. At diagnosis, 75% of patients were in New York Heart Association functional class III or IV. Six-minute walk test was 329 +/- 109 m. Mean pulmonary artery pressure, cardiac index, and pulmonary vascular resistance index were 55 +/- 15 mm Hg, 2.5 +/- 0.8 L/min/m(2), and 20.5 +/- 10.2 mm Hg/L/min/m(2), respectively. The low estimates of prevalence and incidence of PAH in France were 15.0 cases/million of adult inhabitants and 2.4 cases/million of adult inhabitants/yr. One-year survival was 88% in the incident cohort. CONCLUSIONS: This contemporary registry highlights current practice and shows that PAH is detected late in the course of the disease, with a majority of patients displaying severe functional and hemodynamic compromise."
8082625,"We determined the average annual incidence of epilepsy characterized by infantile spasms (IS) in Iceland based on the 13 cases identified in a 10-year interval (1981-1990). The cumulative incidence was 3 in 10,000 live births. Males were more frequently affected than females. All patients responded completely (10) or partially (3) to ACTH or steroid therapy. At follow-up, all children with cryptogenic IS are seizure-free and have developed normally intellectually. One of the children with cryptogenic IS has mild spastic diplegia. All children in the symptomatic group are mentally retarded, and 5 of 7 continue to have unprovoked seizures. We detected no evidence for familial aggregation, and the incidence of seizures or epilepsy did not appear to be increased in first-degree relatives of cases. The proportion of cases with a favorable outcome was greater than that reported in most clinical series."
20814823,"Isolated long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (LCHADD) is associated with c.1528G>C substitution in the HADHA gene, since most patients have the prevalent mutation on at least one allele. As it is known that the disease is relatively frequent in Europe, especially around the Baltic Sea, and that the majority of Polish LCHADD patients originate from the coastal Pomeranian province, partly inhabited by an ancient ethnic group, the Kashubians, we aimed to determine the carrier frequency of the prevalent HADHA mutation in various districts of Poland with special focus on the Kashubian district. A total of 6,854 neonatal dried blood samples from the entire country, including 2,976 Pomeranian neonates of Kashubian origin, were c.1528G>C genotyped. Fifty-nine heterozygous carriers for the prevalent c.1528G>C substitution (41 Pomeranian children) were detected in the studied group. Our data reveal a geographically skewed distribution of the c.1528C allele in the Polish population; in the northern Pomeranian province the carrier frequency is 1:73, which is the highest frequency ever reported, whereas in the remaining regions it is 1:217. Hence, the incidence of LCHADD in Poland is predicted to be 1:118,336 versus 1:16,900 in the Pomeranian district. Despite the relative rarity of the disease, screening for LCHADD in neonates born in the northern part of Poland, especially those of Kashubian origin, is justified. Our data allow us to suggest a probable Kashubian origin of the prevalent c.1528G>C mutation."
22119351,"The RARECARE project aims at increasing knowledge of rare cancers in Europe. This manuscript describes the epidemiology (incidence, prevalence, survival) of rare urogenital cancers, taking into account the morphological characterisation of these tumours.We used data gathered by RARECARE on cancer patients diagnosed from 1995 to 2002 and archived in 64 European population-based cancer registries, followed up to December 31st, 2003 or later.The annual number of males that develop penile cancer in the EU is estimated at 3100, which is equivalent to an age standardised rate (ASR) of 12 per million males. The 5-year relative survival rate is 69%, while squamous cell carcinoma is the predominant morphological entity. Each year around 650 persons in the EU develop cancer of the urethra and 7200 develop cancer of the renal pelvis or ureter (RPU). The ASR for cancer of the urethra and RPU is 1.1 (males 1.6; females 0.6) and 12 (males 16; females 7) per million inhabitants, respectively. The 5-year relative survival rate for cancer of the urethra and RPU is 54% and 51%, respectively. Transitional cell carcinoma is the predominant morphological entity of cancer of the urethra and RPU.In view of the low number of cases and the fact that one third to one half of the patients die of their disease, centralisation of treatment of these rare tumours to a select number of specialist centres should be promoted."
15858962,"AIM:To determine the incidence amongst infants born at term or near-term of extreme hyperbilirubinaemia, i.e., with a serum concentration of unconjugated bilirubin exceeding the limit above which an exchange transfusion was indicated according to the authorized guidelines. METHOD:The investigation period covered 2 y, 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2001, and included all infants born alive at term or near-term in Denmark. All infants with extreme hyperbilirubinaemia admitted to paediatric departments were recorded. RESULTS:Thirty-two infants developed extreme hyperbilirubinaemia, i.e., an incidence of 25 per 100 000. The maximum total serum bilirubin concentration (TSB) was 492 (385-689) micromol/I (median (range)). The median value of the exchange transfusion limits was 450 micromol/l. Twelve infants had signs and symptoms of central nervous system involvement; 11 had acute bilirubin encephalopathy phase-1 symptoms; and one had phase-2 symptoms. Nineteen infants developed extreme hyperbilirubinaemia during primary admission to the maternity ward or neonatal department; the others after having been discharged. There was no difference in maximum TSB between those infants not discharged from hospital and those infants admitted to hospital from home. Maximum TSB appeared latest amongst those infants admitted from home (p < 0.01), and these more often had signs and symptoms of central nervous system involvement (p < 0.05). Ten infants were of non-Caucasian extraction. Less than half of all Danish mothers receive both verbal and written information after birth on jaundice in the infant. CONCLUSION:Twenty-five per 100 000 infants born at term or near-term developed extreme hyperbilirubinaemia, the majority of them whilst in hospital. Infants admitted from home more often had signs and symptoms of central system involvement."
9465547,"To estimate prevalence and incidence of adult Still's disease in Japan, and to describe the epidemiological features of the patients, a nationwide epidemiological survey was conducted in 1994. The study consisted of two questionnaires which were distributed to the heads of the relevant departments, randomly sampled, in hospitals throughout Japan. Following major epidemiological findings emerged from the study: (a) The total annual number of patients treated for adult Still's disease was estimated as 1,100 in 1993 in Japan. The estimated crude prevalence among those aged 16 years or older were calculated as 0.73 and 1.47 per 100,000 population for males and females, respectively, with the corresponding crude incidence rate of 0.22 and 0.34. (b) The sex ratio (female to male) of the reported patients was 2.1. This female predominance might be specific to Japan, though additional surveys in other countries will be warranted. The mean age of the patients was 38.1 years, and female patients tended to be older than male ones; 50% of the female patients aged 40 years or older, while so did only 28% of the male patients."
9187683,"Friedreich ataxia (FA) is an autosomal recessive, neurodegenerative disorder characterized by polypurine trinucleotide expansion. The (GAA)n motif is located in intron 18 of the STM7 gene (previously considered as intron 1 of the X25 gene) on chromosome 9q13. We studied the distribution profile of the polymorphic (GAA)n repetitive tract in 178 healthy individuals. The number of repeats of the trinucleotide block ranged from 7 to 29. In three individuals there were more than 29 repetitions of the GAA motif. While two of the individuals would be diagnosed as carriers of the FA mutation (GAA size > 90), the status of the third person, with a (GAA)58 tract, appears less clear at present. Thus an FA carrier rate of 1/60 to 1/90 can be assumed for the German population. In addition an intermediate-sized allele, (GAA)38 was identified in a mother with two affected children. The (GAA)38 allele appears to be expanded during transmission to at least (GAA)66 and (GAA) > 400 in her two FA-affected offspring. Therefore the shortest known STM7 allele conferring FA is (GAA)66. These novel facts have to be considered for differential diagnosis and definition of the FA carrier state."
14685153,"Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) are a group of inherited metabolic disorders individually considered as rare, and few data on its prevalence has been reported in the literature. The overall birth prevalence of the 29 different LSDs studied in the Portuguese population was calculated to be 25/100000 live births, twice the prevalence previously described in Australia and in The Netherlands. The comparison of the prevalence profile of the LSDs presenting a prevalence higher than 0.5/100000 in the Portuguese, Dutch and Australian populations showed, in the Portuguese, the existence of a higher prevalence of GM2 gangliosidoses (B variant), mucolipidoses (II and III), Niemman-Pick type C and metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD), and a lower prevalence of Pompe and Fabry. The highest prevalence value for a single LSD is the one of GM2 gangliosidoses (B variant), corresponding to 3/100000, a value which is significantly higher than the prevalence of the most frequent LSD in Dutch, Pompe disease (2/100000) and Australians, Gaucher's disease (GD) (1.8/100000). It is worth noting that the highest prevalence of GM2 gangliosidoses found in the Portuguese is mainly due to the existence of a unique subtype, the rare juvenile B1 variant."
25472774,"The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence rates of mucopolysaccharidoses in Poland and to compare them with other European countries. A retrospective epidemiological survey covering the period between 1970 and 2010 was implemented. Multiple ascertainment sources were used to identify affected patients. The overall prevalence of mucopolysaccharidoses in the Polish population was 1.81 per 100,000. Five different mucopolysaccharidoses were diagnosed in a total of 392 individuals. MPS III was the most frequent mucopolysaccharidosis, with a birth prevalence of 0.86 per 100,000 live births. A prevalence of approximately 0.22 cases per 100,000 births was obtained for MPS I. For MPS II, the prevalence was estimated as 0.45 cases per 100,000 births; for MPS IV A and B as 0.14 cases in 100,000 births; and that for MPS VI as 0.03 cases per 100,000 births. 1. The prevalence pattern of mucopolysaccharidosis in Poland is lower when compared to the prevalence reported for other European countries, such as the Netherlands, Czech Republic, or Germany, but similar to countries like Sweden and Denmark. 2. Different frequencies of the various forms of mucopolysaccharidosis were observed. 3. In the case of MPS VI, the incidence values for Poland were the lowest of all the studies previously published so far."
25344219,"BACKGROUND: Holt-Oram syndrome (HOS) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterised by upper limb anomalies and congenital heart defects. We present epidemiological and clinical aspects of HOS patients using data from EUROCAT (European Surveillance of Congenital Anomalies) registries. METHODS: The study was based on data collected during 1990-2011 by 34 registries. The registries are population-based and use multiple sources of information to collect data on all types of birth using standardized definitions, methodology and coding. Diagnostic criteria for inclusion in the study were the presence of radial ray abnormalities and congenital heart disease (CHD), or the presence of either radial ray anomaly or CHD, with family history of HOS. RESULTS: A total of 73 cases of HOS were identified, including 11 (15.1%) TOPFA and 62 (84.9%) LB. Out of 73 HOS cases, 30.8% (20/65) were suspected prenatally, 55.4% (36/65) at birth, 10.7% (7/65) in the first week of life, and 3.1% (2/65) in the first year of life. The prenatal detection rate was 39.2% (20/51), with no significant change over the study period. In 55% (11/20) of prenatally detected cases, parents decided to terminate pregnancy. Thumb anomalies were reported in all cases. Agenesis/hypoplasia of radius was present in 49.2% (30/61), ulnar aplasia/hypoplasia in 24.6% (15/61) and humerus hypoplasia/phocomelia in 42.6% (26/61) of patients. Congenital heart defects (CHD) were recorded in 78.7% (48/61) of patients. Isolated septal defects were present in 54.2 (26/48), while 25% (12/48) of patients had complex/severe CHD. The mean prevalence of HOS diagnosed prenatally or in the early years of life in European registries was 0.7 per 100,000 births or 1:135,615 births. CONCLUSIONS: HOS is a rare genetic condition showing regional variation in its prevalence. It is often missed prenatally, in spite of the existence of major structural anomalies. When discovered, parents in 45% (9/20) of cases opt for the continuation of pregnancy. Although a quarter of patients have severe CHD, the overall first week survival is very good, which is important information for counselling purposes."
1798430,"A comparison of epidemiological and clinical features of trigeminal neuralgia (TN) and glossopharyngeal neuralgia (GN) in Rochester, Minn., reveals several differences. The overall age- and sex-adjusted annual incidence rates were significantly higher for TN than for GN (4.7 vs. 0.8 per 100,000 population). The TN:GN ratio was increased for both men and women and was 5.9:1 for both sexes combined. This ratio is greater than reported in previous non-population-based studies. GN is a milder disease than TN, as indicated by the number of episodes, treatment, and characterization of pain. The right side is affected more often with TN than with GN. Bilaterality was noted less often in TN than in GN cases."
22258386,"OBJECTIVES: Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's) (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) are uncommon and have unknown aetiology. The aim of the study was to investigate the epidemiology of GPA and MPA in a stable, well-defined population looking for differences in the pattern of occurrence, which might suggest a different aetiology. METHODS: Since 1988, we have maintained a prospective register of all patients with systemic vasculitis attending the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital. Patients presenting with new-onset GPA and MPA as defined by the European Medicines Agency algorithm and registered with general practitioners in the former Norwich Health Authority area between 1988 and 2010 were identified. The population in 2008 was estimated to be 459 000 (221 000 males). RESULTS: One hundred and eleven GPA and 58 MPA incident cases were identified during 1988-2010. The overall annual incidence of GPA and MPA was 11.3/million and 5.9/million, respectively. There was evidence of a cyclical pattern of occurrence with a periodicity of 7.6 years for GPA with a peak incidence of 28.3/million in 2005 and the lowest in 2002 (2.2/million). Other lesser peaks occurred in 1990 and 1996. While the peak incidence of MPA was in 2008 (15.2/million), there was no convincing evidence of periodicity. The incidence of cANCA/PR3- or pANCA/MPO-positive vasculitis showed a similar pattern to GPA and MPA, respectively. CONCLUSION: This study lends support to the notion that the aetiology of GPA and MPA may be distinct conditions with different aetiologies. The cyclical incidence of GPA is possibly an indication for the influence of infection."
21047175,"Sex-linked dystonia parkinsonism (XDP, DYT3, ""Lubag"") is an adult-onset, progressive, debilitating movement disorder first described in Filipino males from Panay Islands in 1975. XDP manifests predominantly as torsion dystonia, later combined with or sometimes replaced with parkinsonism. Within the Island of Panay, the prevalence rate is highest in the province of Capiz, where 1:4000 men suffer from the disorder. There is a high degree of penetrance and generalization. While women often serve as carriers, XDP is not limited to men. An updated XDP Philippine registry (as of January 2010) has identified 505 cases, with 500 males and 5 females. While some report that females may carry a milder form of the disorder, in our experience, both sexes generally follow a similar progressive clinical course."
6601351,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) was diagnosed in 36 patients in Middle-Finland Central Hospital District during 1976-1981. The annual incidence of ALS was 2.4 per 100,000 population and the prevalence rate was 6.4 per 100,000 population. The age-specific incidences of ALS were similar for men and women with a maximum of 14/100,000/year in the age group 60-69 years. The initial symptoms originated in 37% of the patients from bulbar and in 63% from spinal levels. Bulbar onset was more common in patients aged 60 years or more compared with younger patients. Patients with bulbar onset had a significantly poorer prognosis than those with spinal onset, which explained the poorer prognosis of older patients. 4 matched controls were chosen for each ALS patient from the files of the Central Hospital. There was no difference between the patients and the controls with respect to previous injuries, surgical operations, malignant neoplasms, or exposure to domestic animals. An earlier observation that evacuees from Karelia ceded to USSR after World War II should have a prevalence twice that of the remaining population was not substantiated."
1018302,"A national distribution of 66 French patients, from 49 sibships, has been studied. Segregation analysis, using the maximum likelihood method, was found to agree with the theoretical values expected in recessive autosomal inheritance. The birthplaces of these patients show an unequal geographic distribution of cystinosis, the incidence being higher in Western France. Compared with the total number of live births during the period 1959 to 1972, the minimum incidence of the condition in the province of Brittany is 1 per 25 909, and the gene frequency 0.0062. In the rest of France, the minimum incidence is 1 per 326,440 and the gene frequency 0.0018. Application of Dahlberg's formula gives a similar result. The mean inbreeding coefficient is 530 X 10(-5), a figure 23 times higher than the mean coefficient of France. An indirect test of inbreeding, the distance between parental birthplaces, was studied, first using the French administrative boundaries, second by using kilometers. This distance was constantly smaller for the parents of patients than for the parents of controls. Analysis of two erythrocyte polymorphisms (ABO and Rh) showed a large excess of group A patients when compared with overall French data. These findings are difficult to interpret on genetic grounds. The genetic reasons for the unequal geographic distribution of cystinosis in France are discussed."
22396771,"BACKGROUND: The limited availability of prevalence data based on a representative sample of the general population, and the limited number of diseases considered in studies about co-morbidity are the critical factors in study of autoimmune diseases. This paper describes the prevalence of 12 autoimmune diseases in a representative sample of the general population in the South of Sardinia, Italy, and tests the hypothesis of an overall association among these diseases. METHODS: Data were obtained from 21 GPs. The sample included 25,885 people. Prevalence data were expressed with 95% Poisson C.I. The hypothesis of an overall association between autoimmune diseases was tested by evaluating the co-occurrence within individuals. RESULTS: Prevalence per 100,000 are: 552 rheumatoid arthritis, 124 ulcerative colitis, 15 Crohn's disease, 464 type 1 diabetes, 81 systemic lupus erythematosus, 124 celiac disease, 35 myasthenia gravis, 939 psoriasis/psoriatic arthritis, 35 systemic sclerosis, 224 multiple sclerosis, 31 Sjogren's syndrome, and 2,619 autoimmune thyroiditis. An overall association between autoimmune disorders was highlighted. CONCLUSIONS: The comparisons with prevalence reported in current literature do not show outlier values, except possibly for a few diseases like celiac disease and myasthenia gravis. People already affected by a first autoimmune disease have a higher probability of being affected by a second autoimmune disorder. In the present study, the sample size, together with the low overall prevalence of autoimmune diseases in the population, did not allow us to examine which diseases are most frequently associated with other autoimmune diseases. However, this paper makes available an adequate control population for future clinical studies aimed at exploring the co-morbidity of specific pairs of autoimmune diseases."
7969703,"Involuntary movements originate from different parts of the nervous system. The character of movements depends upon the site of the lesion and the type of pathological change. The presence of more than one type of involuntary movement in a patient can cause confusion and difficulty in the proper classification of movement disorders, which then leads to problems in the differential diagnosis and appropriate treatment. This work was planned to estimate the prevalence and to study the aetiological factors of chorea, dystonia, athetosis and hemiballismus in Assiut, a representative community of Upper Egypt. This study was carried out on 7,000 families (42,000 subjects) representing different types of communities (2,000 families from urban, 2,000 families from suburban and 3,000 families from rural communities). All members of these samples were personally interviewed at home. Full clinical assessment and special investigations required for the diagnosis of different types of chorea, dystonia and athetosis were carried out in Assiut University Hospital. The prevalence rate for rheumatic chorea was 62/100,000 population and it was significantly higher (p < 0.01) among rural than urban and suburban populations, whereas Huntington's chorea had a prevalence rate of 21/100,000 with no significant difference between different areas studied (urban, suburban and rural). The other two common types of chorea were reported with prevalence rates of 12/100,000 for the encephalitic type and 17/100,000 for the atherosclerotic type. No single case of generalized dystonia was recorded and all cases were of the focal type of dystonia with a prevalence rate of 26/100,000 population. No significant differences were recorded between the different areas studied (urban, suburban and rural).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
27603905,"The prevalence of phenotypic females with a 46,XY karyotype is low, thus current knowledge about age and clinical presentation at diagnosis is sparse even for the most frequent conditions, androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS), and gonadal dysgenesis.To estimate incidence, prevalence, age at diagnosis, and clinical presentation at diagnosis in 46,XY females.A nationwide study covering all known females with a 46,XY karyotype in Denmark since 1960. The diagnosis of 46,XY disorder of sex development (DSD) was determined by medical record evaluation, data from the Danish National Patient Registry, and genetic testing, if available.A total of 166 females registered as 46,XY females in the Danish Cytogenetic Central Registry were identified.A total of 124 females were classified as having 46,XY DSD, 78 with AIS and 25 with gonadal dysgenesis, whereas the remaining subjects had a variety of different diagnoses. The prevalence of 46,XY females was 6.4 per 100 000 live born females, and for AIS and gonadal dysgenesis, it was 4.1 and 1.5 per 100 000, respectively. Median age at diagnosis was 7.5 years (95% confidence interval, 4.0-13.5; range, 0-34 y) in AIS and 17.0 years (95% confidence interval, 15.5-19.0; range, 0-28 y) in gonadal dysgenesis (P = .001). Clinical presentation was dependent on cause of DSD.The first estimate on prevalence of 46,XY females is 6.4 per 100 000 live born females. The presentation of AIS and gonadal dysgenesis is distinctly different, with AIS being diagnosed during childhood and gonadal dysgenesis during pubertal years. The presenting phenotype is dependent on the cause of 46,XY DSD."
22719002,"Dravet syndrome is a severe infantile onset epileptic encephalopathy associated with mutations in the sodium channel alpha 1 subunit gene SCN1A. To date no large studies have systematically examined the prognostic, clinical and demographic features of the disease. We prospectively collected data on a UK cohort of individuals with Dravet syndrome during a 5-year study period and analysed demographic information based on UK population and birth figures. From structured referral data we examined a range of clinical characteristics including epilepsy phenotype, seizure precipitants, electroencephalography data, imaging studies, mutation class and response to medication. Predictors of developmental outcome were determined by logistic regression. We identified 241 cases with SCN1A mutation-positive Dravet syndrome, 207 of which were UK-based. The incidence of mutation-positive Dravet syndrome is at least 1:40 900 UK births. Clinical features predicting a worse developmental outcome included status epilepticus (odds ratio = 3.1; confidence interval = 1.5-6.3; P = 0.003), interictal electroencephalography abnormalities in the first year of life (odds ratio = 5.7; confidence interval = 1.9-16.8; P = 0.002) and motor disorder (odds ratio = 3.3; confidence interval = 1.7-6.4; P < 0.001). No significant effect was seen for seizure precipitants, magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities or mutation class (truncating versus missense). Abnormal magnetic resonance imaging was documented in 11% of cases, principally with findings of non-specific brain atrophy or hippocampal changes. Sodium valproate, benzodiazepines and topiramate were reported as being the most helpful medications at the time of referral. Aggravation of seizures was reported for carbamazepine and lamotrigine. The identification of factors influencing prognosis both aids counselling and encourages early, syndrome-specific therapy. Prevention of status epilepticus with regular medication and emergency protocols is important and may influence developmental outcome."
11008591,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of Huntington disease (HD) in New South Wales on Australian Census Day (6 August) 1996. DESIGN: Survey of records of the Huntington Disease Service and major hospitals, and of neurologists, psychiatrists, clinical geneticists and genetic counsellors. SUBJECTS AND SETTING: All patients in NSW who, on Census Day 1996, either had a definite diagnosis of HD (motor signs of chorea or ataxia and family history of HD or positive DNA test result) or would have had signs and later received a definite diagnosis (assessed 1 April 1997 to 1 July 1999). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence (HD patients per 100,000 population); patient characteristics; year and basis of diagnosis. RESULTS: 380 patients with definite HD were identified, giving a prevalence of HD in NSW in 1996 of 6.29 per 100,000 population (95% CI, 5.68-6.96). A third of HD patients were aged 60 years or older. Diagnosis was confirmed by DNA testing for 171 patients (45%), including 30 (8%) with no recorded family history. Average numbers of new diagnoses per year were 11.8 (1984-1988), 21.8 (1989-1993) and 28.6 (1994-1998). Estimated number of people with a 50% risk of inheriting the HD mutation was 25.2 per 100,000 population. Estimated incidence of HD in 1996 was 0.65 per 100,000 population. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of HD in NSW is similar to estimated prevalence in other Australian and Western populations. Increasing numbers of cases are being diagnosed, and the 18 chronic care beds currently designated for HD patients in NSW are unlikely to be sufficient."
11251990,"Exstrophy of the bladder (EB) and exstrophy of the cloaca (EC) are generally recognizable as distinct clinical entities. In patients with EB, the posterior bladder wall is exposed through a midline defect of the abdomen. The umbilicus is inferiorly displaced and located close to the superior margin of the exstrophic bladder. Genital abnormalities are common in boys and girls who may present epispadias and a small, split phallus or a split clitoris, a bifid uterus, and a duplicate or exstrophic vagina. In contrast to classic EB, EC is commonly associated with omphalocele, spinal defects, and incompletely formed external genitalia and is always associated with imperforate anus. Some authors state that EC and EB constitute two distinct disorders, but others consider them part of a ""continuum,"" representing different levels of severity within the same spectrum. The use of the acronym OEIS to refer to the combination of omphalocele, exstrophy, imperforate anus, and spinal defects, in our opinion, has not helped to clarify the clinical definition, pathogenesis, or cause of this multiple congenital anomaly (MCA) pattern, mostly because the term makes no distinction between EC or EB. Here we present the epidemiological analysis of a group of characteristics in infants with EC and infants with EB to determine if they constitute two different entities. We also analyze if the different combinations of omphalocele, imperforate anus, and spinal defects are more frequent in infants with EC than in infants with MCA patterns other than EC and EB. The prevalence in our data for EC was 1:200,233 live births and 1:35,597 for EB. The clinical analysis indicated that the study defects (omphalocele, spine defects, spina bifida, and imperforate anus) tend to occur together in the same child with a higher frequency if the child has the EC defect than in infants with MCA patterns that did not include EC or EB. Our findings of low birth weight, twinning, single umbilical artery, and preferentially associated malformations suggest that EC is the result of damage occurring very early in development and that EC and EB are two different expressions of a primary polytopic developmental field defect."
18403822,"Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) is an inherited, recessively transmitted inflammatory condition usually occurred in populations from Mediterranean descent (Armenian, Arab, Jewish, Greek, Turkish and Italian populations). Identification of MEFV gene mutations has been of tremendous help for early diagnosis of most cases. The frequency of FMF is different. The prevalence of heterozygous carriers of one of the mutations of MEFV gene is as high as 1 in 5 healthy individuals in Armenia. Genetic testing of this rare Mendelian disorder (MIM no 249100) is efficient for early and prenatal diagnosis of the disease, especially for atypic cases, for carrier screening and pregnancy planning since certain mutations have been shown to have significant correlation with renal amyloidosis (RA), the most severe possible manifestation of FMF. Also genetic testing is very important for colchicine therapy correction. Twelve MEFV mutations are identified in 7000 Armenian FMF patients. Investigation of MEFV mutations in FMF patients (heterozygotes, homozygotes and compound heterozygotes) in comparison with healthy individuals has revealed the most frequent mutations and genotypes, and the information was received about the heterozygous carriers and genotype-phenotype correlation. In heterozygote carriers the most prevalent and severe cases are caused by the presence of a single M694V mutation. Our results could confirm that the MEFV gene analysis provides the first objective diagnostic criterion for FMF (characterisation of the two MEFV mutated alleles in more than 90% of the patients). Molecular testing is also used to screen the MEFV gene for mutations in patients with a clinical suspicion of FMF. We also demonstrated the unfavourable prognostic value of the M694V homozygous genotype, and provided the first molecular evidence for incomplete penetrance and pseudo-dominant transmission of the disease. Overall, these data, which confirm the involvement of the MEFV gene in the development of FMF, should be essential in clinical practice, leading to new ways of managment and treatment of FMF patients."
12145748,"We studied 15 patients, from 10 families, who presented with severe spastic paralysis with an infantile onset and an ascending progression. Spastic paraplegia began during the first 2 years of life and extended to upper limbs within the next few years. During the first decade of life, the disease progressed to tetraplegia, anarthria, dysphagia, and slow eye movements. Overall, the disease was compatible with long survival. Signs of lower motor-neuron involvement were never observed, whereas motor-evoked potentials and magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a primitive, pure degeneration of the upper motor neurons. Genotyping and linkage analyses demonstrated that this infantile-onset ascending hereditary spastic paralysis (IAHSP) is allelic to the condition previously reported as juvenile amyotrophic lateral sclerosis at the ALS2 locus on chromosome 2q33-35 (LOD score 6.66 at recombination fraction 0). We analyzed ALS2, recently found mutated in consanguineous Arabic families presenting either an ALS2 phenotype or juvenile-onset primary lateral sclerosis (JPLS), as a candidate gene. In 4 of the 10 families, we found abnormalities: three deletions and one splice-site mutation. All the mutations lead to a truncated alsin protein. In one case, the mutation affected both the short and the long alsin transcript. In the six remaining families, absence of cDNA ALS2 mutations suggests either mutations in regulatory ALS2 regions or genetic heterogeneity, as already reported in JPLS. Alsin mutations are responsible for a primitive, retrograde degeneration of the upper motor neurons of the pyramidal tracts, leading to a clinical continuum from infantile (IAHSP) to juvenile forms with (ALS2) or without (JPLS) lower motor-neuron involvement. Further analyses will determine whether other hereditary disorders with primitive involvement of the central motor pathways, as pure forms of spastic paraplegia, could be due to alsin dysfunction."
19373260,"PURPOSE: To describe the incidence and survival rate of patients with retinoblastoma in Taiwan over a 25-year period, from 1979 to 2003. METHODS: Cases of retinoblastoma have been reported to the Taiwan National Cancer Registry (TNCR) since 1979. Retinoblastoma data from 1979 to 2003 were retrieved from the TNCR databank for analysis of both the incidence and survival rate. Trends in the incidence rate were estimated by calculating the annual percentage change (APC). RESULTS: From 1979 to 2003, a total of 380 patients (182 [47.9%] females) with retinoblastoma were identified. Of the 380 cases, 359 patients (94.5%) were diagnosed before 5 years of age. The average annual age-standardized incidence rate was 4.45 per million in children under 10 years of age and 8.58 per million in children under 5 years of age. There was a significant increasing trend in the incidence rate over the study period with an APC of 2.3% (P=0.035). Before the implementation of Taiwan's National Health Insurance (NHI) Program in 1995, the mean age at diagnosis was 4.8+/-13.3 years and the 5-year survival rate was 74.7%. After implementation of the NIH Program, the mean age at diagnosis decreased to 1.6+/-2.1 years (P<0.001) and the 5-year survival rate increased to 84.7% (P=0.063). CONCLUSIONS: We report the first population-based study on retinoblastoma in Taiwan. There was a significant increasing trend in the incidence rate from 1979 to 2003. Since the implementation of Taiwan's NHI, the mean diagnostic age decreased."
11581453,"OBJECTIVE:To provide health care providers, patients, and the general public with a responsible assessment of currently available data regarding screening for and management of phenylketonuria (PKU). PARTICIPANTS:A nonfederal, nonadvocate, 14-member panel representing the fields of pediatrics, genetics, human development, public policy, nursing, and molecular physiology and including patient representatives. In addition, 19 experts in pediatrics, medical genetics, psychology, pediatric neurology, biochemical and molecular genetics, and gene therapy presented data to the panel and to a conference audience of 312. EVIDENCE:The literature was searched using Medline for January 1980 through July 2000, and an extensive bibliography of 3394 references was provided to the panel. Experts prepared abstracts for their conference presentations with relevant citations from the literature. Scientific evidence was given precedence over clinical anecdotal experience. CONSENSUS PROCESS:The panel, answering predefined questions, developed its conclusions based on the scientific evidence presented in open forum and the scientific literature. The panel composed a draft statement, which was read in its entirety and circulated to the experts and the audience for comment. Thereafter, the panel resolved conflicting recommendations and released a revised statement at the end of the conference. The panel finalized the revisions within a few weeks after the conference. The draft statement was made available on the World Wide Web immediately after its release at the conference and was updated with the panel's final revisions. The statement is available at http://consensus.nih.gov. CONCLUSIONS:Genetic testing for PKU has been in place for almost 40 years and has been very successful in preventing severe mental retardation in thousands of children and adults. Metabolic control is necessary across the lifespan of individuals with PKU. A comprehensive, multidisciplinary, integrated system is needed to delivery of care to individuals with PKU. Greatly needed are consistency and coordination between screening, treatment, data collection, and patient support programs. There should be equal access to culturally sensitive, age-appropriate treatment programs. Ethically sound, specific policies for storage, ownership, and use in future studies of archived samples remaining from PKU testing should be established. Research into the pathophysiology of PKU and relationship to genetic, neural, and behavioral variation is strongly encouraged. Uniform policies must be established to remove financial barriers to the acquisition of medical foods and modified low-protein foods and to provide access to support services needed to maintain metabolic control in individuals with PKU. Research on nondietary alternative treatments for PKU is strongly encouraged. To achieve optimal statistical power and cross-cultural applicability, it will be beneficial to use data acquired via national and international collaboration.phenylketonuria, hyperphenylalanimea, phenylketonuria screening, phenylalanine-restricted diet, maternal phenylketonuria, newborn screening, phenylalanine monitoring, phenylketonuria outcomes."
19396827,"Previous studies on the incidence of the various types of mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) in different populations have shown considerable variation. However, information regarding the incidence of MPS in the Asian population is lacking. An epidemiological study of the MPS disorders in Taiwan using multiple ascertainment sources was undertaken, and incidences of different types of MPS during the period of 1984-2004 were estimated. We compared our data with previous reports in different populations. The combined birth incidence for all MPS cases was 2.04 per 100,000 live births. MPS II (Hunter syndrome) had the highest calculated birth incidence of 1.07 per 100,000 live births (2.05 per 100,000 male live births), comprising 52% of all MPS cases diagnosed. The birth incidences of MPS I (Hurler syndrome), III (Sanfilippo syndrome), IV (Morquio syndrome), and VI (Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome) were 0.11, 0.39, 0.33, and 0.14 per 100,000 live births, respectively, which accounted for 6%, 19%, 16%, and 7% of all MPS, respectively. No cases of MPS III D (Sanfilippo syndrome type D), MPS IV B (Morquio syndrome type B), MPS VII (Sly syndrome) or MPS IX were ascertained during the study period. Overall incidence of MPS in Taiwan was consistent with that reported in Western populations. However, in contrast to the higher incidence of MPS I in most Western populations, this study showed a higher incidence of MPS II in Taiwan. It remains to be investigated whether this discrepancy is attributed to the under-diagnosis of MPS I in Taiwan or to ethnic differences."
16001099,AIM: To present a retrospective and prospective epidemiological and clinical study on Darier disease in Slovenia. RESULTS: Data on 77 DD patients was collected in the period 1973 to 2003 from the major dermatological departments and outpatient units in Slovenia. The prevalence of Darier disease in Slovenia is calculated at 3.8/100000 inhabitants. The ratio of affected/unaffected family members is 0.355. The comparison of two groups of DD patients (younger and older than 19 years) for the onset of the disease did not differ significantly although in two thirds of patients DD appeared for the first time before the age of 19 years. CONCLUSION: The epidemiological and clinical data on Darier's disease in Slovenia conform to similar reports with the exception of the higher prevalence of the disease in Slovenia. UV radiation seems to be an important triggering factor and therefore it is reasonable to advise DD patients to avoid sun exposure.
7720834,"The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) have attracted great interest during the last decade. Unfortunately there is not much material published concerning the incidence of these conditions. We present epidemiologic data on MDS based on case registration of patients in a well-defined population and as a comparison similar data on acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Between the years 1978-1992 we registered 120 cases of MDS and 146 cases of AML. The median age for all the MDS cases was 74.1 years for men and 78.2 years for women. Among haematologists there is a suspicion that the incidence of MDS is rising. Our study does not support this opinion. We have divided the study period into 5-year periods and the crude incidence has been 3.2, 4.1 and 3.5/100,000/year for each period. In the age group over 70 years MDS was more frequent than AML and in the last 5-year period the incidence was 15.0/100,000/year for MDS compared to 10.2/100,000/year for AML. In conclusion MDS is quite common among elderly people and there is no evidence for a rising incidence during the last 15 years."

METHODS:The case records of patients with PSC seen at Changi General Hospital were analyzed in terms of demographic profile, clinical presentation, clinical course, treatment and complications. RESULTS:Ten cases of PSC were diagnosed over a 10-year period. The male:female ratio was 9:1. The median age of diagnosis was 49.5 years (mean: 50.9 years; range: 35-63 years). With regards to clinical presentation, seven patients had hepatobiliary sepsis, two patients had asymptomatic liver biochemistry abnormalities while one patient had cholestatic jaundice. Prevalence rate of perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (pANCA) was 20%. Symptomatic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) was diagnosed in 20% of PSC cases. Eight patients (80%) had intrahepatic ductal involvement while two patients (20%) had combined intrahepatic and extrahepatic ductal involvement on endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). The prevalence rate of recurrent cholangitis was 30% while that of recurrent liver abscess, cirrhosis and common bile duct stricture were all 10%. The mean duration of follow up was 6.6 years with one death from liver failure. CONCLUSION:The clinical profile of patients with PSC in Singapore appears to differ with other published data, with a greater number presenting with hepatobiliary sepsis and less frequent association with IBD and pANCA. It is hypothesized that this may be related to differences in environmental triggers and genetic susceptibility."
22375084,"The minimum prevalence of lethal Osteogenesis imperfecta type II, thanatophoric dysplasia and achondroplasia were derived following detailed case note review of all perinatal lethal skeletal dysplasias (SD) in Northern Ireland over a 12 year period. Multiple sources of ascertainment, including genetic notes, radiological reports and post mortem findings, were used. 39 cases were identified. Thanatophoric dysplasia was the commonest diagnosis made (22), followed by osteogenesis imperfecta type II (four children) and achondroplasia (two children). Eleven other diagnoses each occurred once in the 12 year period. The minimum prevalence range, per live births, of each of the common skeletal dysplasias in Northern Ireland has been calculated; thanatophoric dysplasia 0.80/10,000, osteogenesis imperfecta type II 0.15/10,000 and achondroplasia 0.07/10,000. The prevalence range for thanatophoric dysplasia is much higher than reported in previous studies. We discuss reasons for the prevalence figures obtained."
6203284,"Cases of epidermolysis bullosa (EB) were gathered from the hospital files of dermatological clinics and university pediatric clinics in Finland over a period of 10 years. 40 families were identified, containing 121 live sufferers from this condition, after which genealogical analysis revealed a further 55 patients. 11 out of the 17 subtypes of EB (1) were diagnosed in these families. The diseases found in two families were difficult to type according to the present classification, and were therefore handled separately. No regional accumulation was found and it seems that there is no type of EB which represents a peculiarly Finnish form. The most significant difference compared with the Norwegian material was the very much lower incidence of the recessive dystrophic subtype in Finland."
23661427,"OBJECTIVE: Systemic sclerosis sine scleroderma (ssSSc) is an infrequent SSc variant characterized by visceral and immunological manifestations of SSc in the absence of clinically detectable skin involvement. We sought to delineate the characteristics of ssSSc in a cohort of Brazilian patients and contrast them with those in the literature. METHODS: SSc patients seen at two academic medical centres in Brazil were retrospectively analysed. Patients were classified as ssSSc if they presented with RP, positive ANAs and at least one visceral involvement typical of SSc in the absence of skin thickening. Demographics, clinical and laboratory data were obtained by chart review. Literature review was performed by searching available original studies up until June 2012. RESULTS: Among the 947 consecutive patients with SSc, 79 (8.3%) were classified as ssSSc. Oesophagus was the most frequently affected organ (83.1%), followed by pulmonary involvement (63.2%). Compared with the limited cutaneous form of SSc, telangiectasia was the only variable significantly different after multivariate logistic regression analyses (odds ratio 0.46; 95% CI 0.27, 0.81). Compared with the diffuse cutaneous form of SSc, multivariate analyses revealed that ssSSc patients were less likely to be male (odds ratio 0.15; 95% CI 0.04, 0.57), have digital ulcers (odds ratio 0.26; 95% CI 0.13, 0.51) or anti-Scl70 antibodies (odds ratio 0.19; 95% CI 0.07, 0.55) and less frequently treated with CYC (odds ratio 0.23; 95% CI 0.12, 0.43). These features were comparable to those in the published literature. CONCLUSION: In this series, patients with ssSSc had a relatively mild disease with good prognosis."
9155958,"The prevalence of epidermolysis bullosa (EB) in Britain and most other countries is unknown. Patients suffering from the inherited forms of EB and living in Scotland have been traced. Two hundred and fifty-nine affected people from 76 families have been identified, of whom 211 were clinically assessed. One-third of these Scottish EB sufferers had never been seen by a dermatologist. In Lothian, where there appears to be a relatively high prevalence of EB, 75% of patients were unknown to their general practitioners. The point prevalence of all forms of EB at the outset of the study was 49.0 per million, comprising EB simplex 28.6 per million and dystrophic EB 20.4 per million. Extrapolation of accurate data available for the Lothians suggests that the point prevalence of all forms of EB in Scotland is in excess of these figures."
22002951,"Cloacal exstrophy presents as a complex abdominal wall defect thought to result from a mesodermal abnormality. Anatomically, its main components are Omphalocele, bladder Exstrophy and Imperforate anus. Other associated malformations include renal malformations and Spine defects (OEIS complex). Historically, the prevalence ranges from 1 in 200,000 to 400,000 births, with higher rates in females. Cloacal exstrophy is likely etiologically heterogeneous as suggested by its recurrence in families and occurrence in monozygotic twins. The defect has been described in infants with limb-body wall, with trisomy 18, and in one pregnancy exposed to Dilantin and diazepam. Due to its rarity, the use of a nonspecific diagnostic code for case identification, and lack of validation of the clinical findings, cloacal exstrophy remains an epidemiologic challenge. The purpose of this study was to describe the prevalence, associated anomalies and maternal characteristics among infants born with cloacal exstrophy. We used data from the International Clearinghouse for Birth Defects Surveillance and Research submitted from 18 birth defect surveillance programs representing 24 countries. Cases were clinically evaluated locally and reviewed centrally by two authors. Cases of persistent cloaca were excluded. A total of 186 cases of cloacal exstrophy were identified. Overall prevalence was 1 in 131,579 births: ranging from 1 in 44,444 births in Wales to 1 in 269,464 births in South America. Live birth prevalence was 1 in 184,195 births. Prevalence ratios did not vary by maternal age. Forty-two (22.6%) cases met the criteria for the OEIS complex, whereas 60 (32.3%) were classified as OEI and 18 (9.7%) as EIS (one with suspected VATER (0.5%)). Other findings included two cases with trisomy 13 (one without a karyotype confirmation), one with mosaic trisomy 12 (0.5%), one with mosaic 45,X (0.5%) and one classified as having amnion band sequence (0.5%). Twenty-seven (14.5%) infants had other anomalies unrelated to cloacal exstrophy. Cloacal exstrophy is a rare anomaly with variability in prevalence by geographic location. The proportion of cases classified as OEIS complex was lower in this study than previously reported. Among all cases, 54.8% were reported to have an omphalocele."
19452307,"Our objective was to assess the incidence of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and its temporal variations, between 1997 and 2007. The study was based on data prospectively gathered by the referral ALS 'expert centre' of the Regional University Hospital of Limousin (710,792 inhabitants). Patients were included if they were diagnosed with ALS according to the revised El Escorial criteria either at the time of diagnosis or at subsequent follow-up, and if they resided in Limousin when diagnosed. We identified a high crude incidence (2.5/100,000). When age-standardized for the 1999 French population, the mean annual incidence was 2.0/100,000 inhabitants (95% CI 1.8-2.3) overall and 4.4 (95% CI 3.6-5.2) in the 45-74 years age group. Crude incidence by age groups showed a progressive increase up to 85 years, followed by a sharp decrease thereafter. Age at diagnosis was particularly high in our population (median, 69.4 years). Incidence of ALS in Limousin was consistent with previous work published by European population-based registries. The atypical epidemiology was explained in part by Limousin's older aged population. It is proposed that our referral centre will become a population-based registry."
11701256,"AIM:To investigate and analyze the current epidemiological and clinical data for West syndrome (WS) in Korea, including treatments and outcome. METHODS:Prepared survey forms were sent to hospitals located all over Korea to collect data on cases of WS treated between January 1997 and June 2000. Data from 21 institutes were returned. RESULTS:Data were collected for 358 children (219 boys and 139 girls) who were diagnosed and treated for WS. The incidences of WS were 112 cases in 1997, 104 cases in 1998, 108 cases in 1999, and 34 cases in the first half of 2000. Based on these figures, the presumed annual incidence of WS in Korea was derived to be one in 4000 live births, although there was a great inter-district variability. Regarding the etiology, 138 cases (38.5%) were cryptogenic. For the 220 symptomatic cases, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) was the most common etiologic factor (50.8%), followed by central nervous system anomaly including malformation of cortical development (21.4%), and neurocutaneous syndrome (8.6%). Clinically flexor type spasms were most common (59.2%) and 199 cases (55.6%) revealed typical hypsarrhythmia, electroencephalographically. During 1997 and 1998, vigabatrin (VGB) was used most frequently for the treatment of WS, followed by valproic acid and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). In 1999 and 2000, the use of ACTH diminished and topiramate was used more frequently than ACTH. Spasms were controlled in 230 cases (64.2%) and evolution to other seizure types was observed in 44 cases (11.2%). Developmental and/or mental retardation were noticed in 270 cases (75.4%). CONCLUSIONS:The yearly incidence of WS did not show significant change in Korea between 1997 and 2000. Among symptomatic WS, HIE was the most common cause. During the period of this study, VGB was the most popular therapeutic regimen possibly because of shortage of ACTH. Recently, topiramate has showed promising signs as a therapy for WS."
22407836,"Currently accepted birth prevalence for osteochondrodysplasias (OCD) of about 2/10,000 is based on few studies from small series of cases. We conducted a study based on more than 1.5 million births. OCD cases were detected from 1,544,496 births occurring and examined in 132 hospitals of ECLAMC (Latin American Collaborative Study of Congenital Malformations) between 2000 and 2007. Cases were detected and registered according to a pre-established protocol, and then ranked in four diagnostic evidence levels (DEL), according to available documentation. For the analysis of risk factors, a healthy control sample born in the same period was used. OCD was diagnosed in 492 newborns, resulting in a prevalence per 10,000 of 3.2 (95% CI: 2.9-3.5). Perinatal lethality (stillbirths plus early neonatal deaths) occurred in 50% of cases. Prenatal ultrasound diagnosis was made in 73% of cases (n = 359). Among 211 cases from the best documented group (DEL-1) and according to international classification, 33% of cases fit into the G-25 (osteogenesis imperfecta), 29% in Group-1 (FGFR3), and 8% in Group-18 (Bent bones). The prevalence of the main OCD types were: OI-0.74 (0.61-0.89); thanatophoric dysplasia-0.47 (0.36-0.59); and achondroplasia-0.44 (0.33-0.55). Paternal age (31.2 ± 8.5), parity (2.6), and parental consanguinity rate (5.4%) were higher in cases than in controls (P < 0.001). In conclusion, the OCD overall prevalence of 3.2 per 10,000 found seems to be more realistic than previous estimates. This study also confirmed the high perinatal mortality, and the association with high paternal age, parity, and parental consanguinity rate."
18362409,"In order to compare the epidemiological aspects of tsutsugamushi disease (scrub typhus) between Korea and Japan, we analyzed the current state of tsutsugamushi disease outbreaks and related risk factors. The average prevalence rate of tsutsugamushi disease from 2001 to 2005 in Korea was higher than that in Japan (7.2 and 0.3 per 100,000 population, respectively) (P<0.01). The seasonal distribution in Korea showed that the incidence of tsutsugamushi disease in autumn (94.5% of total cases) was higher than in Japan (38.2%) (P<0.01), while the incidences of outbreaks in other seasons were much higher in Japan (P<0.01). In Korea, more females (64.8%) were infected than males (35.2%) (P<0.01), while there was no significant difference in Japan. The remarkable difference between the gender distribution in Korea and Japan is believed to reflect cultural differences between the two countries in terms of work, dress and ornamentation. In both countries, elderly people (over 60 years old), especially in rural areas, showed a very high prevalence rate (50%), which is possibly due to increased outdoor activities and a decreased number of young people in those areas. These differences in tsutsugamushi disease risk factors reflect the different influences of vectors/hosts, climate, and geographical and cultural characteristics between the two countries."
22893605,"BACKGROUND.: Prognostic factors and outcomes in patients with marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) have been studied in small cohort studies, which may not reflect the population at large. METHODS.: Clinical characteristics and survival outcomes of adult patients with MZL who were diagnosed between 1995 and 2009 were evaluated using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. The authors generated clinical prognostic models for subtypes of MZL and compared survival during the periods of 1995 through 2000, 2001 through 2004, and 2005 through 2009. RESULTS.: The prognosis was significantly better for patients with mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma (5-year relative survival rate of 88.7%; P < .0001) compared with those with the splenic MZL (SMLZ)or nodal MZL (NMZL) subtypes (5-year relative survival rates of 79.7% and 76.5%, respectively). There was evidence of improved outcomes in patients with NMZL and MALT lymphomas between 1995 and 2009 (P < .0001), with no difference noted in patients with SMZL (P = .56). Advancing age and the presence of B symptoms had prognostic significance in all MZL subtypes. Male sex and stage of disease were significant only for the NMZL and MALT categories. Survival in patients with MALT lymphomas varied depending on the site of origin, with a worse prognosis noted in those with gastrointestinal and pulmonary locations of origin (5-year incidence rate of lymphoma-related death, 9.5%-14.3%) compared with ocular, cutaneous, and endocrine sites (4.5%-7.8%; P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS.: The survival for patients with SMZL is similar to that for those with NMZL, and unlike the NMZL and MALT subtypes, it has not improved over the past decade. The prognosis of patients with MALT lymphoma varies according to the anatomical site of origin."
18668261,"This report demonstrates the prevalence of primary congenital hypothyroidism (CH) in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and summarizes the laboratory data. Neonatal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) was measured in whole blood drawn between the 3rd and 5th days of life and spotted on filter paper using the fluorometric assay. Among the 87,061 neonates, 22 had CH, 13 dysgenetic forms, and nine with thyroids in situ. No differences were found between the two types in terms of TSH and total T4 concentrations. However, thyroglobulin was significantly lower in patients with dysgenetic thyroid tissue (p=0.0023). We conclude that the prevalence of CH in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina is 1:3,957 newborns."
22461456,"The Utah Birth Defect Network (UBDN) collects population-based data for Utah on births from all resident women. The prevalence of skeletal dysplasias and epidemiologic characteristics/outcomes were evaluated. Cases categorized as a skeletal dysplasia from all live births, stillbirths, and pregnancy terminations (TAB) between 1999 and 2008 were reviewed by three clinical geneticists. After case review, 153 were included for analysis (88% live births, 3% stillborn, 9% TAB), and categorized by groupings defined by molecular, biochemical, and/or radiographic criteria as outlined in the 2010 Nosology and Classification of Genetic Skeletal Disorders. The overall prevalence for skeletal dysplasias was 3.0 per 10,000 births, and 20.0 per 10,000 stillbirths. The most common diagnostic groups were osteogenesis imperfecta (OI; n = 40; 0.79 per 10,000), thanatophoric dysplasia (n = 22; 0.43 per 10,000), achondroplasia (n = 18; 0.35 per 10,000), and cleidocranial dysplasia (n = 6; 0.12 per 10,000). The most common groups based on the 2010 Nosology and Classification of Genetic Skeletal Disorders were the FGFR3 chondrodysplasia group (n = 41; 0.81 per 10,000), the OI/decreased bone density group (n = 40; 0.79 per 10,000), and the type 2 collagen group (n = 10; 0.2 per 10,000). Median age of postnatal diagnosis was 30 days (range 1-2,162). Of those deceased, 88% were prenatally suspected; of those alive 29% prenatally suspected. Median age of death for live born individuals was 1 day (range 1-1,450 days). Previously reported prevalence rates vary, but our data provide a population-based approach not limited to the perinatal/neonatal period. Understanding the range for survival within each group/diagnosis is beneficial for health care providers when counseling families."
19845775,"The objectives of this paper were to study the reported haemophilia A prevalence (per 100 000 males) on a country-by-country basis and address the following: Does the reported prevalence of haemophilia A vary by national economies? We collected prevalence data for 106 countries from the World Federation of Hemophilia (WFH) annual global surveys and the literature. We found that the reported haemophilia A prevalence varied considerably among countries, even among the wealthiest of countries. The prevalence (per 100 000 males) for high income countries was 12.8 +/- 6.0 (mean +/- SD) whereas it was 6.6 +/- 4.8 for the rest of the world. Within a country, there was a strong trend of increasing prevalence over time--the prevalence for Canada ranged from 10.2 in 1989 to 14.2 in 2008 (R = 0.94 and P < 0.001) and for the United Kingdom it ranged from 9.3 in 1974 to 21.6 in 2006 (R = 0.94 and P < 0.001). Prevalence data reported from the WFH compared well with prevalence data from the literature. Patient registries generally provided the highest quality of prevalence data. The lack of accurate country-specific prevalence data has constrained planning efforts for the treatment and care of people with haemophilia A. With improved information, healthcare agencies can assess budgetary needs to develop better diagnostic and treatment facilities for affected patients and families and work to ensure adequate supplies of factor VIII concentrates for treatment. In addition, this information can help manufacturers plan the production of concentrates and prevent future shortages."
9447611,"An epidemiological study of hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) was carried out in south western Finland, with a population of 435,000. The diagnosis was established in 69 patients from 23 unrelated families through family and medical history, clinical neurological and neurophysiological examinations and with documentation of the deletion at gene locus 17p11.2 in at least one member of each family. This gave a prevalence of at least 16/100,000, which is remarkably high. However, due to the insidious nature of HNPP, most probably it is still an underestimation. This is the first population-based prevalence figure reported for HNPP. The prevalence is somewhat lower than that obtained for CMT in the same population, which agrees with the proposal that HNPP and CMT 1A are reciprocal products of the same unequal crossing-over. The clinical pictures of our patients were, in general, similar to those previously described in HNPP."
18808419,"BACKGROUND: Studies from different countries have reported an increased incidence of primary cutaneous lymphomas over the last decades. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the incidence rates of primary cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) and mycosis fungoides (MF)/Sézary syndrome (SS) in Norway, and to compare these rates with those reported from other countries. METHODS: Data from the Cancer Registry of Norway on non-Hodgkin lymphomas during the period 1980-2003 were analysed. RESULTS: In total, 337 cases of CTCL were reported to the Cancer Registry during the study period, of which 262 cases were classified as MF/SS. The incidence rate of CTCL increased significantly (P(trend) < 0.001) from 0.16 (95% confidence interval, CI 0.11-0.20) per 100,000 person-years in 1980-84 to 0.29 (95% CI 0.22-0.36) per 100,000 person-years in 2000-2003. The incidence of MF/SS also increased during the same period (P(trend) = 0.05) from 0.15 (95% CI 0.10-0.19) per 100,000 person-years to 0.18 (95% CI 0.13-0.24) per 100,000 person-years. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of both CTCL and MF/SS increased in Norway during the period 1980-2003."
16186547,"The authors identified 298 diagnoses of moyamoya in California and Washington from hospital discharge databases during the period 1987 to 1998. The incidence was 0.086/100,000 persons. The ethnicity-specific incidence rate ratios compared to whites were 4.6 (95% CI: 3.4 to 6.3) for Asian Americans, 2.2 (95% CI: 1.3 to 2.4) for African Americans, and 0.5 (95% CI: 0.3 to 0.8) for Hispanics. The incidence of moyamoya in Washington and California was lower than reported in Japan, but the rate among US Asians is similar."
3264051,"The epidemiology of generalized and focal dystonias was investigated in the Rochester, Minnesota, population over the period 1950-1982. The crude incidence of generalized dystonia was 2 per million persons per year, and for all focal dystonias combined, 24 per million per year. The crude prevalence rate was 34 per million persons for generalized dystonia and 295 per million persons for all focal dystonias. Torticollis was the most common focal dystonia; essential blepharospasm, oromandibular dystonia, spasmodic dysphonia, and writer's cramp were less common and had roughly equal incidence and prevalence rates."
17432547,"Ecuador is one of the Latin American countries where cystic fibrosis has not been thoroughly studied. The goal of this study was to establish the incidence of this specific pathology and the incidence of the 29 most common European CF mutations in Ecuador's population. We performed a prospective-descriptive study with the intention of including patients registered at the Ecuadorian Cystic Fibrosis Foundation as well as the main pediatric hospitals in Ecuador. The inclusion criteria were clinical manifestations of cystic fibrosis plus two positive pilocarpine iontophoresis sweat tests (CI >60 mEq/L). We tested F508del mutation by heteroduplex method and then, we confirmed these results and searched for other 28 frequent European-mutations aside from F508del by a reverse dot blot technique (INNO-LiPA CFTR 29 + Tn). Sixty two unrelated patients were included. Both heteroduplex and reverse dot blot methods identified 53.22% of all mutations. The estimated Ecuadorian cystic fibrosis incidence was 1:11,252. The mutations found and their incidence were F508del (37.1%), G85E (8.9%), G542X (2.4%), N1303K (2.4%), G551D (1.6%) and R334W (0.8%). The incidence of cystic fibrosis in Ecuador is closely similar to other Latin American countries where there is a large ""mestizo"" population. We are reporting one of the highest incidences of G85E in the world."
15476442,"OBJECTIVE:To undertake a multicentre epidemiological study reflecting acromegaly in Spain. DESIGN:Voluntary reporting of data on patients with acromegaly to an online database, by the managing physician. METHODS:Data on demographics, diagnosis, estimated date of initial symptoms and diagnosis, pituitary imaging, visual fields, GH and IGF-I concentrations (requested locally), medical, radiotherapy and neurosurgical treatments, morbidity and mortality were collected. RESULTS:Data were included for 1219 patients (60.8% women) with a mean age at diagnosis of 45 years (s.d. 14 years). Reporting was maximal in 1997 (2.1 cases per million inhabitants (c.p.m.) per year); prevalence was globally 36 c.p.m., but varied between 15.7 and 75.8 c.p.m. in different regions. Of 1196 pituitary tumours, most were macroadenomas (73%); 81% of these patients underwent surgery, 45% received radiotherapy and 65% were given medical treatment (somatostatin analogues in 68.3% and dopamine agonists in 31.4%). Cures (GH values (basal or after an oral glucose tolerance test) <2 ng/ml, normal IGF-I, or both) were observed in 40.3% after surgery and 28.2% after radiotherapy. Hypertension (39.1%), diabetes mellitus (37.6%), hypopituitarism (25.7%), goitre (22.4%), carpal tunnel syndrome (18.7%) and sleep apnoea (13.2%) were reported as most frequent morbidities; 6.8% of the patients had cancer (breast in 3.1% of the women and colon in 1.2% of the cohort). Fifty-six patients died at a mean age of 60 years (s.d. 14 years), most commonly of a cardiovascular cause (39.4%); mortality was greater in patients given radiotherapy (hazard ratio 2.29; 95% confidence interval 1.03 to 5.08; P=0.026), and in those in whom GH and IGF-I concentrations were never normal (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS:This acromegaly registry offers a realistic overview of the epidemiological characteristics, treatment outcome and morbidity of acromegaly in Spain. As active disease and treatment with radiotherapy are associated with an increase in mortality, efforts to control the disease early are desirable."
8921488,"BACKGROUND:Anophthalmia and microphthalmia are serious eye malformations which recently have been associated with exposure to Benomyl. Data on these malformations are scarce in the literature and reported prevalences at birth vary strongly. METHODS:Data from three large registers of congenital malformations were analysed and comprised 849 malformed infants based on close to 5.7 million births. RESULTS:This is the largest available epidemiological study on anophthalmia and microphthalmia. The prevalence at birth was 1.50 per 10,000, varying between 0.92 and 2.29 between registers but no varying significantly between races in the California register. The variation in rates was mainly due to different inclusion of chromosomally abnormal infants (mainly trisomy 13) and of infants with microphthalmia occurring with major non-eye malformations. On the other hand, rates of anophthalmia and isolated microphthalmia were similar. Other major non-eye malformations were found in 73% of infants without a known chromosome anomaly. The malformation was bilateral in 53-60% of infants except when microphthalmia existed without any other malformations when only 27% were bilateral. Sex distribution was normal, there was a slight excess of twins, and an increased risk at high maternal age. CONCLUSIONS:In analytical studies searching for the cause of these malformations, it may be useful to restrict the analysis to infants with anophthalmia or isolated microphthalmia as the recording of such cases seems to be more reliable than of microphthalmia occurring with other malformations. The conclusions presented in the literature on the possible effect of Benomyl are partly based on data with apparent very incomplete ascertainment."
23046562,"BACKGROUND: Clinical features, complications and treatments of Gaucher's disease (GD), a rare autosomal-recessive disorder due to a confirmed lysosomal enzyme (glucocerebrosidase) deficiency, are described. METHODS: All patients with known GD, living in France, with ≥ 1 consultations (1980-2010), were included in the French GD registry, yielding the following 4 groups: the entire cohort, with clinical description; and its subgroups: patients with ≥ 1 follow-up visits, to investigate complications; recently followed (2009-2010) patients; and patients treated during 2009-2010, to examine complications before and during treatment. Data are expressed as medians (range) for continuous variables and numbers (%) for categorical variables. RESULTS: Among the 562 registry patients, 265 (49.6%) were females; 454 (85.0%) had type 1, 22 (4.1%) type 2, 37 (6.9%) perinatal-lethal type and 21 (3.9%) type 3. Median ages at first GD symptoms and diagnosis, respectively, were 15 (0-77) and 22 (0-84) years for all types. The first symptom diagnosing GD was splenomegaly and/or thrombocytopenia (37.6% and 26.3%, respectively). Bone-marrow aspiration and/or biopsy yielded the diagnosis for 54.7% of the patients, with enzyme deficiency confirming GD for all patients. Birth incidence rate was estimated at 1/50,000 and prevalence at 1/136,000. For the 378 followed patients, median follow-up was 16.2 (0.1-67.6) years. Major clinical complications were bone events (BE; avascular necrosis, bone infarct or pathological fracture) for 109 patients, splenectomy for 104, and Parkinson's disease for 14; 38 patients died (neurological complications for 15 type-2 and 3 type-3 patients, GD complications for 11 type-1 and another disease for 9 type-1 patients). Forty-six had monoclonal gammopathy. Among 283 recently followed patients, 36 were untreated and 247 had been treated during 2009-2010; 216 patients received treatment in December 2010 (126 with imiglucerase, 45 velaglucerase, 24 taliglucerase, 21 miglustat). BE occurred before (130 in 67 patients) and under treatment (60 in 41 patients) with respective estimated frequencies (95% CI) of first BE at 10 years of 20.3% (14.1%-26.5%) and 19.8% (13.5%-26.1%). CONCLUSION: This registry enabled the epidemiological description of GD in France and showed that BE occur even during treatment."
29516584,"AIM:Umbilical cord ulceration (UCU) is a disease in which an ulcer forms in the umbilical cord in the pregnant uterus and is accompanied by hemorrhaging from the same site. UCU occurs in fetuses with congenital upper-intestinal atresia (CUIA); however, its onset mechanism remains unclear. Here, we report our investigation of cases of UCU in our hospital. METHODS:Among the 9825 deliveries performed between 2007 and 2016 at this hospital, 20 fetuses were diagnosed with CUIA, 4 (20%) of which had UCU. There was no difference in the backgrounds of the fetuses with UCU (UCU group: 4 fetuses) and those without (non-UCU group: 16 fetuses). RESULTS:There was no intergroup difference in gestational age at delivery. Four cases in the UCU group had maternal age 35 weeks (26-39), weeks of delivery 35 weeks (35-36) and weight 2178.5 g (1600-2640); three out of four fetuses were female; and the location of gastrointestinal obstruction was in the duodenum in one case and in the jejunum in three cases. Death occurred in three of four fetuses in the UCU group versus none in the non-UCU group. CONCLUSION:We performed a retrospective statistical investigation on the risk of UCU onset in cases from this hospital; however, we could not identify any prognostic factors for its onset. We investigated a total of 27 past reported UCU cases and the 4 cases in this study. Mean gestational age at onset was 33.3 ± 2.7 for all 27 cases. Various methods for the early discovery of UCU have been reported in the past; however, there is currently no gold standard. Based on this report and a review of past papers, for CUIA, it is desirable to perform in-hospital management from gestational week 30 onward and decide proper delivery timing on a case-by-case basis."
12095924,"The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma is increasing in many countries. The estimated number of new cases annually is over 500,000, and the yearly incidence comprises between 2.5 and 7% of patients with liver cirrhosis. The incidence varies between different geographic areas, being higher in developing areas; males are predominantly affected, with a 2:3 male/female ratio. The heterogeneous geographic distribution reflects the epidemiologic impact of the main etiologic factors and environmental risk, which are the hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis C (HCV) viruses. The percentage of cases of hepatocellular carcinoma attributable to HBV worldwide is 52.3% and is higher in Asia where the seroprevalence of HBsAg in the population is high. However, the vaccination campaign against this virus in some eastern countries has tended to lower the incidence of new cases of hepatocellular carcinoma. The percentage of cases of hepatocellular carcinoma attributable to HCV is 25%, and it is more prevalent in Japan, Spain, and Italy where the association between hepatocellular carcinoma and antibodies to HCV ranges between 50 and 70%. In most cases hepatocellular carcinoma develops in cirrhotic livers, where the persistent proliferation of liver cells represents the key factor of progression to hepatocellular carcinoma independent of the etiology. Another minor risk factor is aflatoxin B1 consumption, which is responsible for most cases of hepatocellular carcinoma in Africa, where the consumption of contaminated foods is common. Other known risk factors are some hereditary diseases, such as hemochromatosis, porphyria cutanea tarda, hereditary tyrosinemia, and alpha1 anti-trypsin deficiency. The natural history of hepatocellular carcinoma is heterogeneous and is influenced by nodule dimension, the mono- or plurifocality of lesions at diagnosis, the growth rate of the tumor, and the stage of the underlying cirrhosis. Available data to date suggest that tumor growth in a cirrhotic liver is variable and that the time in which a lesion in undetectable until it becomes 2 cm is between 4 and 12 months. Therefore, the suggested interval for surveillance screening with ultrasound in patients with liver cirrhosis has been set at 6 months. Patients who should benefit from screening programs are those who would be treated with curative therapy if diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma. Thus, the ideal target population should be limited to Child-Pugh's class A cirrhotic patients without significant comorbidity."
22827594,"Paracetamol is the most common cause of acute liver failure (ALF) in many countries. Much data on paracetamol toxicity originate from liver transplant centers and tertiary referral institutions. The authors analyzed the population-based annual incidence of paracetamol overdoses and ALF, and described the risk factors for hepatotoxicity.A search was undertaken for the diagnosis of paracetamol overdoses in the diagnoses registry of the National University Hospital of Iceland from 2004 to 2009 serving a population of 219,249 inhabitants. Relevant information was collected from medical records.A total of 1913 drug-related poisoning episodes were identified and reviewed, 352 (18%) involved paracetamol overdoses. The annual incidence of paracetamol overdoses declined from 30.0 (2004) to 16.0/100,000 per year (2009) (p < 0.05). The female/male ratio was 3.0 and the largest age group was 16-25 years. After the initial examination, 26% were discharged home. Hospitalized index visits were 182 with accidental overdoses constituting 16 (9%) with no gender difference. Compared with intentional overdose the accidental group had higher aminotransferases (p < 0.005). ALF occurred in 3.8% (7/182) of the index visits and the incidence was 0.7/100,000 per year. In the intentional group, 1.2% (2/163) developed ALF versus 25% (4/16) of the accidental group (p = 0.001). Only one patient died from ALF and none underwent liver transplantation.The annual incidence of paracetamol overdoses was high in this population-based study but declined. Young females with intentional overdose accounted for most of the cases, whereas accidental overdoses were more common in older patients. The occurrence of ALF was low and mostly associated with accidental overdose."
16406649,"We studied 28 Polish hereditary fructose intolerant (HFI) patients (26 unrelated) by direct sequencing of the ALDOB coding region/splice sites. Eight different mutations were found including two novel ones (each found in two unrelated individuals): c.250delC (frameshift) and c.522 C > G (p.Y174X). The most frequent mutation c.448 G > C (p.A150P, 67% of chromosomes) was screened for in a group of 1049 randomly selected unrelated individuals. Eight (1:131) carriers were found allowing to estimate the HFI prevalence in Poland as 1:31,000."
2225525,"All the cases of Friedreich's ataxia (FA) diagnosed between 1945 through 1984 among residents of a defined area of northwestern Italy were ascertained (N = 59). Cases were diagnosed according to the criteria of the ""Quebec Cooperative Study on Friedreich's Ataxia (QCSFA)"" with minor modifications. We identified 39 families with 47 probands and 12 secondary cases. Therefore ascertainment probability was 80%. Male to female ratio was 1:1. Pedigrees were compatible with autosomal recessive inheritance. Segregation ratio was 0.28 with both Weinberg's method and the ""singles"" method (under incomplete ascertainment). Point prevalence ratio was 1.2/100,000 population. Birth incidence rate was 1/36,000 live births. Gene frequency was estimated to be 1/191. The ratio of first-cousin marriages observed among parents of FA patients (3%) was lower than expected from Dahlberg's formula (8%). This finding is not compatible with the hypothesis of genetic heterogeneity for FA."
17512233,"Mandated screening of newborns for congenital hypothyroidism (CH) in NYS was initiated in l978. Currently, every newborn screening program in the U.S. includes CH in its panel. Between 1978 and 2005, 7.4 million newborns were screened for CH in NYS. In NYS, between 1978 and 2005, the incidence of CH has increased by 138%. Nationwide (excluding NYS data), with nearly 58 million infants screened between 1987 and 2002, the incidence has increased 73% between 1987 and 2002. These data and possible reasons for the increases are discussed, though no definitive causes are identified."
23725136,"The aim of this paper was to present the incidence rates of leukemia and multiple myeloma (MM) in Golestan province located in northeastern Iran during 2004-2009.This was a descriptive cross-sectional study. Data on newly diagnosed (incident) leukemia and MM cases were obtained from collected from Golestan population-based cancer registry. Data was entered into CanReg-4 software. Age standardized incidence rates (ASR) (per 100000 person-years) for leukemia and MM were calculated. Data on Golestan population was obtained from the data of Iranian national census in 2006.Totally, 11036 new cancer cases were registered in GPRC from 2004-2009. Leukemia and MM accounted for 693 and 124 of cases, respectively. The mean age in patients with leukemia and MM was 43.8 and 62.4 years, respectively. The ASRs for leukemia among men and women were 10.4 and 7.8, respectively (p<0.001). The ASRs for MM were 2.1 and 2 in men and women, respectively (p=0.93). The rate of leukemia was significantly higher in rural areas (p=0.02) whereas the incidence of MM was higher in urban areas (p<0.001).Our results showed a high incidence rate of leukemia in Golestan province of Iran. The incidence of leukemia was significantly higher in males and residents of rural areas. High exposure to pesticides and other agricultural related products may be a possible explanation for epidemiological pattern of leukemia in this area. Determining and controlling important risk factors, especially environmental factors, of leukemia may lead to decrease in its burden in Golestan province of Iran."
17498805,"PURPOSE: To estimate incidence rates of uveal melanoma in Europe from 1983 to 1994. DESIGN: Incidence analysis of data from cancer registries adhering to the European Cancer Registry-based study on survival and care of cancer patients (EUROCARE) (cases diagnosed from 1983 to 1994). PARTICIPANTS: Data of 6673 patients with ocular melanoma (as defined by International Classification of Diseases for Oncology morphology codes 8720 to 8780 [melanoma] and International Classification of Diseases 9 (ICD9) codes 190.0 [iris and ciliary body], 190.5 [retina], 190.6 [choroid], and 190.9 [unspecified ocular location]) from 33 cancer registries of 16 European countries. METHODS: Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were obtained from a multilevel Poisson regression model. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence rates and IRRs associated with demographic and geographic variables. RESULTS: Standardized incidence rates increased from south to north across registries, from a minimum of <2 per million in registries of Spain and southern Italy up to >8 per million in Norway and Denmark. The inclusion of tumors with unspecified ocular location (code 190.9) increased incidence rates in most United Kingdom registries, but not in the other geographic areas, where this code was seldom used for uveal melanomas. Incidence increased noticeably up to age 55 (IRR, 1.46 per 5 years; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.36-1.57) but leveled off after age 75 (IRR, 0.99 per 5 years; 95% CI, 0.93-1.05), with intermediate levels midway (IRR, 1.18 per 5 years; 95% CI, 1.12-1.23). It was also higher in males (IRR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.16-1.28). Rates were stable during the study period, but a cohort effect was evidenced, accounting for higher incidence rates in people born during the period 1910 to 1935 (P = 0.005). Incidence increased with latitude (P = 0.008), which explained most differences in rates among areas. CONCLUSIONS: In this large series of uveal melanomas, we found stable incidence during the years 1983 to 1994. The north-to-south decreasing gradient supports the protective role of ocular pigmentation. European ophthalmologists should develop guidelines to standardize the coding of tumors treated conservatively using the ICD classification to improve the registration and surveillance of uveal melanoma by cancer registries."
17345612,"BACKGROUND: Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) became reportable to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program (the United States cancer surveillance program) in 2001. This provided the first opportunity to examine the incidence and survival of patients with MDS in the United States using a large, population-based database. METHODS: The SEER 17 regions public-use database (November 2005 submission) was accessed to obtain data on the frequency, incidence, and survival of patients with MDS. Geographic areas were selected for inclusion in the SEER Program based on their ability to operate and maintain a high-quality, population-based cancer reporting system and for their epidemiologically significant population subgroups. RESULTS: SEER data from 2001 through 2003 indicated that the risk of MDS increased with age, and approximately 86% of MDS cases were diagnosed in individuals aged > or =60 years (median age at diagnosis = 76 years). Men had a significantly higher incidence rate than women (4.5 vs 2.7 per 100,000 per year). Among racial groups, white individuals had the highest incidence rate. In 2003, approximately 10,300 incident cases of MDS were diagnosed in the United States. The survival of MDS patients was poor, with an observed 3-year survival rate of only 35% (5-year survival data were not available at the time of the current report). Male patients and patients who were diagnosed at an older age had significantly worse survival. MDS survival also varied by clinical subtype, and the survival of patients who had refractory anemia was somewhat worse than reported previously. The availability of descriptive epidemiologic data on MDS can be used now to facilitate much needed research on the etiology and outcome of MDS. CONCLUSIONS: The current results indicated that >10,000 incident cases of MDS are diagnosed annually in the United States, and the survival of patients with MDS is poor. The availability of descriptive epidemiologic data on MDS can be used now to facilitate much needed research on the etiology and outcomes of MDS."
7776710,"OBJECTIVE:To determine the frequency of fetal urinary tract anomalies and to characterize the types of such abnormalities detected on ultrasonography and the outcome of affected patients during a 15-year period at our institution. DESIGN:We retrospectively reviewed the findings on maternal prenatal ultrasound examinations and the postnatal medical records of 56 children with urinary tract abnormalities detected by prenatal ultrasound examination at Mayo Clinic Rochester from November 1979 to June 1994. RESULTS:Of the 56 children, 18 (32%) had severe urinary tract anomalies in conjunction with oligohydramnios, pulmonary hypoplasia, and perinatal death (Potter's syndrome). The other 38 infants had various urinary tract abnormalities--most commonly, isolated hydronephrosis and multicystic dysplasia of the kidney. Six of the 38 children had more than one renal abnormality detected prenatally. Reflux was noted in association with prenatally detected urinary tract abnormalities in 4 of 32 newborns (12%) who underwent voiding cystourethrography. In fetuses with normal amniotic fluid volume, the perinatal outcome was good. Children with lower urinary tract obstruction had evidence of more severe renal dysfunction than did those with involvement at more proximal levels. The presence or absence of urinary tract obstruction postnatally could not be determined reliably on the basis of prenatal ultrasound appearance. CONCLUSION:In this study, more than half of all prenatally detected urinary tract abnormalities were isolated hydronephrosis or multicystic dysplasia of the kidney. Postnatal renal function could not be reliably predicted on the basis of prenatal ultrasound findings."
8645532,"Systemic mastocytosis is a rare pathology that can affect most systems of the human organism. Although diagnosis is often fortuitous and prognosis good in a very high percentage of cases, it can sometimes present in extremely severe and occasionally fatal forms. With the aid of the available literature, we discuss the most recent classifications, clinical features and diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to this disease. We then do an epidemiological review of the cases reported in Reggio Emilia over the past 9 years. Due to the lack of symptoms of this pathology, its reported incidence of about 0.3 new cases per 100,000 inhabitants per year is obviously underestimated. Drug therapy is purely symptomatic and does not affect its clinical evolution."
9787927,"The incidence and age distribution of bronchiectasis is at present poorly known. The aim here was to describe the use made of hospital services by bronchiectasis patients in Finland over ten years and to estimate the incidence of this disease. Data on hospital admissions for bronchiectasis were obtained from the register maintained by the National Research and Development Centre for Welfare and Health. Admissions and new cases during the period 1983-1992 were calculated by age and sex in relation to the total population. There were 5,710 admissions for bronchiectasis and 1,928 new cases. The occurrence of cases treated in hospital was 4.9 per million person-years at age 0-14 years, 103.8 at 65 years or over and 38.9 in the total population. The estimated incidence of bronchiectasis is low in Finland, especially in childhood, and efforts aimed at its treatment should now be directed specifically at the elderly population, which continues to exert considerable pressure on even a relatively well developed health service in this respect."
29656928,"INTRODUCTION:Migraine variant disorders of childhood include benign paroxysmal torticollis of infancy (BPTI) and benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood (BPVC). This study aimed to review our experience with BPTI and BPVC and determine the incidence of children transitioning between each of these disorders and to vestibular migraine (VM). METHODS:We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients seen at the Balance and Vestibular Program at Boston Children's Hospital between January 2012 and December 2016 who were diagnosed with BPTI, BPVC, and/or VM. RESULTS:Fourteen patients were diagnosed with BPTI, 39 with BPVC, and 100 with VM. Abnormal rotary chair testing was associated with progression from BPTI to BPVC (n = 8, p = 0.045). Eight (57.1%) patients with BPTI and 11 (28.2%) with BPVC had motor delay. Eleven (78.6%) patients with BPTI and 21 (53.8%) with BPVC had balance impairment. Six BPTI patients developed BPVC (42.9%), six BPVC patients developed VM (15.4%), and two patients progressed through all three disorders (2%). One BPTI patient progressed directly to VM. DISCUSSION:Most patients with BPTI will experience complete resolution in early childhood, but some will progress to BPVC, and similarly many patients with BPVC will progress to VM. Parents of children with these disorders should be made aware of this phenomenon, which we refer to as ""the vestibular march."" Children with BPTI and BPVC should also be screened for hearing loss, otitis media, and motor delay."
26813285,"Recently, mutations in transmembrane protein 240 (TMEM240) were identified as the cause of spinocerebellar ataxia type 21 (SCA21) in several French families. Clinically, SCA21 is characterized as an early-onset, slowly progressive cerebellar syndrome typically associated with cognitive impairment. To date, molecular screening of SCA21 has not been reported among patients of other ethnic origins or in other areas. Here we used Sanger sequencing to detect mutations in exons of TMEM240 in 340 unrelated probands with spinocerebellar ataxia for whom commonly known causative mutations have been excluded (96 probands of autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia families and 244 patients with sporadic spinocerebellar ataxia). As a result, a de novo missense mutation (c.509C > T/p.P170L) was identified in one sporadic SCA patient. The condition manifested as early-onset (30 years old), slowly progressive cerebellar ataxia accompanied by mild early evidenced mental retardation, mild frontal behavior disorders and intentional hand tremors. Although rare, a SCA21 case was identified and described in mainland China, thus broadening the ethnic distribution of SCA21 beyond French families."
9463329,"PLO-SL (polycystic lipomembranous osteodysplasia with sclerosing leukoencephalopathy) is a recessively inherited disorder characterized by systemic bone cysts and progressive presenile frontal-lobe dementia, resulting in death at <50 years of age. Since the 1960s, approximately 160 cases have been reported, mainly in Japan and Finland. The pathogenesis of the disease is unknown. In this article, we report the assignment of the locus for PLO-SL, by random genome screening using a modification of the haplotype-sharing method, in patients from a genetically isolated population. By screening five patient samples from 2 Finnish families, followed by linkage analysis of 12 Finnish families, 3 Swedish families, and 1 Norwegian family, we were able to assign the PLO-SL locus to a 9-cM interval between markers D19S191 and D19S420 on chromosome 19q13. The critical region was further restricted, to approximately 1.8 Mb, by linkage-disequilibrium analysis of the Finnish families. According to the haplotype analysis, one Swedish and one Norwegian PLO-SL family are not linked to the chromosome 19 locus, suggesting that PLO-SL is a heterogeneous disease. In this chromosomal region, one potential candidate gene for PLO-SL, the gene encoding amyloid precursor-like protein 1, was analyzed, but no mutations were detected in the coding region."
10478959,"Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is characterized by a burning sensation in the oral cavity although the oral mucosa is clinically normal. The syndrome mostly affects middle-aged women. Various local, systemic and psychological factors have been found to be associated with BMS, but its etiology is not fully understood. Oral complaints and salivary flow were surveyed in 669 men and 758 women randomly selected from 48,500 individuals between the ages 20 and 69 years. Fifty-three individuals (3.7%), 11 men (1.6%) and 42 women (5.5%), were classified as having BMS. In men, no BMS was found before the age group 40 to 49 years where the prevalence was 0.7%, which increased to 3.6% in the oldest age group. In women, no BMS was found in the youngest age group, but in the age group 30 to 39 years the prevalence was 0.6% and increased to 12.2% in the oldest age group. Subjective oral dryness, age, medication, taste disturbances, intake of L-thyroxines, illness, stimulated salivary flow rate, depression and anxiety were factors associated with BMS. In individuals with BMS, the most prevalent site with burning sensations was the tongue (67.9%). The intensity of the burning sensation was estimated to be 4.6 on a visual analogue scale. There were no increased levels of depression, anxiety or stress among individuals with more pain compared to those with less pain. It was concluded that BMS should be seen as a marker of illness and/or distress, and the complex etiology of BMS demands specialist treatment."
23551862,"AIM: Cardiac arrhythmias are an important cause of morbidity in infants. Although the spectrum of types of arrhythmia has been reported, there has been no previous population-based study of the incidence of arrhythmias in infancy. Our aim was to define the population incidence of arrhythmia in infants. METHODS: We based this study on the Northern Region of England with a resident population of 3.1 million and an annual live birth rate of 33,000. We identified all clinically significant arrhythmias in infants in 1991-2010 from the regional cardiac database. All diagnoses were based on analysis of the electrocardiogram. Infants with only the substrate for arrhythmia (such as QT prolongation or ventricular pre-excitation) were excluded. RESULTS: In 20 years, there were 662,698 live births. We identified 162 cases of newly diagnosed arrhythmia of which 22 had associated structural cardiovascular malformations. The incidence of arrhythmia was 24.4 per 100,000 live births. The most common arrhythmia was atrioventricular re-entry tachycardia with an incidence of 16.3 per 100,000. Complete atrioventricular block and atrial flutter both occurred at 2.1 cases per 100,000 live births, and other arrhythmias were rare. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to report a population incidence of arrhythmia in infants."
15127914,"BACKGROUND:Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and hemolytic uremic syndrome are rare disorders characterized by platelet aggregation, microthrombi, and resulting tissue damage. We studied the incidence and possible risk factors for these diseases in 3 large populations in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada. METHODS:Data were derived from a large health insurer in the United States, general practices in the United Kingdom, and the Province of Saskatchewan. We identified potential cases of thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura and hemolytic uremic syndrome in computerized data and verified them by medical record review. We estimated incidence rates for thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura and hemolytic uremic syndrome together and separately, and we conducted a case-control study to evaluate potential risk factors. RESULTS:The age-sex standardized incidence of thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura and hemolytic uremic syndrome was higher than previously reported (6.5, 2.2, and 3.2 per million per year in the United States, United Kingdom, and Saskatchewan, respectively), but there was no secular trend. The incidence of thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura and hemolytic uremic syndrome was higher in women than men. Most cases of hemolytic uremic syndrome occurred before 20 years of age. We confirmed several known risk factors for thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura and hemolytic uremic syndrome (cancer, bone marrow transplantation, pregnancy). CONCLUSION:The incidence of thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura and hemolytic uremic syndrome is higher than previously reported but does not appear to be rising. Apparent international differences in incidence could be the result of imprecision in identifying thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura and hemolytic uremic syndrome in large research databases."
24499825,"Although neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are rare, the number of patients with NET is increasing. However, in Japan, there have been no epidemiological studies on NET since 2005; thus, the prevalence of NET remains unknown.We reported the epidemiology of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) [pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs) and gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumors (GI-NETs)] in Japan in 2005. Here, we conducted the second nationwide survey on patients with GEP-NETs who received treatment in 2010.A total of 3,379 patients received treatment for PNETs in 2010, representing a 1.2-fold increase in the number of patients from 2005 to 2010. The prevalence was estimated to be 2.69/100,000, with an annual onset incidence of 1.27/100,000 in 2010. Non-functioning tumor (NF)-PNETs comprised 65.5% of cases followed by insulinoma (20.9%) and gastrinoma (8.2%). Interestingly, the number of patients with NF-PNETs increased ~1.8 fold since 2005. A total of 19.9% of patients exhibited distant metastasis at initial diagnosis; 4.3% had complications with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN-1), and only 4.0% had NF-PNETs associated with MEN-1. Meanwhile, an estimated 8,088 patients received treatment for GI-NETs, representing a ~1.8-fold increase since 2005. The prevalence was estimated to be 6.42/100,000, with an annual onset incidence of 3.51/100,000. The locations of GI-NETs varied: foregut, 26.1%; midgut, 3.6%; and hindgut, 70.3%. Distant metastasis and complications with MEN-1 were observed in 6.0 and 0.42% at initial diagnosis, respectively. The frequency of carcinoid syndrome in patients with GI-NETs was 3.2%.We clarified the epidemiological changes in GEP-NETs from 2005 to 2010 in Japan."
20104599,"The wide variation in cerebral and facial phenotypes and the recognized etiologic heterogeneity of holoprosencephaly (HPE) contribute to the observed inter-study heterogeneity. High lethality during the early stages of embryonic and fetal development makes HPE detection age dependent. By reviewing 21 HPE epidemiologic articles, the observed prevalence rate differences can be largely explained by the pregnancy outcome status of the studied cohort: livebirth, stillbirth, and terminations of pregnancy (TOPs): lower than 1 per 10,000 when live and still births were included, higher when TOPs were included, and between 40 and 50 per 10,000 in two classical Japanese studies on aborted embryos. The increasing secular trend observed in some studies probably resulted from an increasing use of prenatal sonography. Ethnic variations in birth prevalence rates (BPRs) could occur in HPE, but the available data are not very convincing. Higher BPRs were generally observed in the less favored minorities (Blacks, Hispanics, Pakistanis), suggesting a bias caused by a lower prenatal detection rate of HPE, and consequently less TOPs. Severe ear defects, as well as microstomia, were part of the spectrum of HPE. Non-craniofacial anomalies, more frequently associated with HPE than expected, were genital anomalies (24%), postaxial polydactyly (8%), vertebral defects (5%), limb reduction defects (4%), and transposition of great arteries (4%). The variable female predominance, found in different HPE studies, could also depend on the proportion of early conceptions in each study sample, as males are more likely to be lost through spontaneous abortions."
2919526,"In Finland a nationwide screening programme for congenital hypothyroidism (CHT) has operated since 1980 with complete coverage. Among the total of 307,000 newborns screened, the incidence per 100,000 was 24.6 for thyroid dysgenesis and 4.0 for dyshormonogenesis. We conclude that, when screening is based on cord serum TSH, the false-positive results are caused mainly by difficult delivery. The most important factors associated with dyshormonogenesis were CHT in the family, origin from a geographic risk area, and origin of both mother and father from the same community. These reflect the autosomal recessive inheritance. The risk factors for dysgenesis were female gender, CHT in the family, birth in a geographic risk area, and birth during a risk period of the year."
22140002,"Spina bifida refers to a collection of neural tube defects, including myelomeningocele, meningocele, and myelocele (SB(M) ), as well as lipomyelomeningocele and lipomeningocele (SB(L) ). Maternal race/ethnicity has been associated with an increased risk for spina bifida among offspring. To better understand this relationship, we evaluated different spina bifida subtypes (SB(M) vs. SB(L) ) and sub-phenotypes (anatomic level or presence of additional malformations) by maternal race/ethnicity using data from the National Birth Defects Prevention Study. This study is a large, multisite, population-based study of nonsyndromic birth defects. Prevalence estimates were obtained using data from spina bifida cases (live births, fetal deaths, and elective terminations) and total live births in the study regions. From October 1997 through December 2005, 1,046 infants/fetuses with spina bifida were delivered, yielding a prevalence of 3.06 per 10,000 live births. Differences in the prevalences of SB(M) vs. SB(L) , isolated versus non-isolated SB(M) , and lesion level in isolated SB(M) among case offspring were observed by maternal race/ethnicity. Compared to non-Hispanic (NH) White mothers, offspring of Hispanic mothers had higher prevalences of each subtype and most sub-phenotypes, while offspring of NH Black mothers generally had lower prevalences. Furthermore, differences in race/ethnicity among those with isolated SB(M) were more pronounced by sex. For instance, among male offspring, the prevalence of isolated SB(M) was significantly higher for those with Hispanic mothers compared to NH White mothers [prevalence ratio (PR): 1.55, 95% confidence interval: 1.23-1.95]. These findings provide evidence that certain spina bifida subtypes and sub-phenotypes may be etiologically distinct."
9797590,"BACKGROUND:Medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency is a common disorder of fatty acid oxidation in north west Europe. It is very variable in its clinical consequences and is believed to be considerably underdiagnosed. OBJECTIVE:To investigate the diagnosis and outcome of MCAD deficiency in the UK. METHOD:A prospective surveillance study through the British Paediatric Surveillance Unit. RESULTS:Of 62 affected individuals identified, 57 were from England, giving an incidence of 4.5 cases/100,000 births. Forty six cases presented with an acute illness (10 of whom died), 13 cases were identified because of family history, and three for other reasons. Six of the survivors were neurologically impaired. CONCLUSIONS:Despite increased clinical awareness, the mortality and morbidity from MCAD deficiency remain high. The frequency and severity of the disease support the case for the introduction of universal neonatal screening in England and Scotland."
19577011,"Data on secular trends and outcomes of eosinophilic esophagitis (EE) are scarce. We performed a population-based study to assess the epidemiology and outcomes of EE in Olmsted County, Minnesota, over the last 3 decades.All cases of EE diagnosed between 1976 and 2005 were identified using the Rochester Epidemiology Project resources. Esophageal biopsies with any evidence of esophagitis and/or eosinophilic infiltration were reviewed by a single pathologist. Clinical course (treatment, response, and recurrence) was defined using information collected from medical records and prospectively via a telephone questionnaire. Incidence rates per 100,000 person years were directly adjusted for age and sex to the US 2000 population structure.A total of 78 patients with EE were identified. The incidence of EE increased significantly over the last 3 of the 5-year intervals (from 0.35 [95% confidence interval (CI)], 0-0.87] per 100,000 person-years during 1991-1995 to 9.45 [95% CI, 7.13-11.77] per 100,000 person-years during 2001-2005). The prevalence of EE was 55.0 (95% CI, 42.7-67.2) per 100,000 persons as of January 1, 2006, in Olmsted County, Minnesota. EE was diagnosed more frequently in late summer/fall. The clinical course of patients with EE was characterized by recurrent symptoms (observed in 41% of patients).The prevalence and incidence of EE is higher than previously reported. The incidence of clinically diagnosed EE increased significantly over the last 3 decades, in parallel with endoscopy volume. Seasonal incidence was greatest in late summer and fall. EE also appears to be a recurrent relapsing disease in a substantial proportion of patients."
26607790,"In July 2014, an outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) started in Pujehun district, Sierra Leone. On January 10th, 2015, the district was the first to be declared Ebola-free by local authorities after 49 cases and a case fatality rate of 85.7%. The Pujehun outbreak represents a precious opportunity for improving the body of work on the transmission characteristics and effects of control interventions during the 2014-2015 EVD epidemic in West Africa.By integrating hospital registers and contact tracing form data with healthcare worker and local population interviews, we reconstructed the transmission chain and investigated the key time periods of EVD transmission. The impact of intervention measures has been assessed using a microsimulation transmission model calibrated with the collected data.The mean incubation period was 9.7 days (range, 6-15). Hospitalization rate was 89%. The mean time from the onset of symptoms to hospitalization was 4.5 days (range, 1-9). The mean serial interval was 13.7 days (range, 2-18). The distribution of the number of secondary cases (R 0  = 1.63) was well fitted by a negative binomial distribution with dispersion parameter k = 0.45 (95% CI, 0.19-1.32). Overall, 74.3% of transmission events occurred between members of the same family or extended family, 17.9% in the community, mainly between friends, and 7.7% in hospital. The mean number of contacts investigated per EVD case raised from 11.5 in July to 25 in September 2014. In total, 43.0% of cases were detected through contact investigation. Model simulations suggest that the most important factors determining the probability of disease elimination are the number of EVD beds, the mean time from symptom onset to isolation, and the mean number of contacts traced per case. By assuming levels and timing of interventions performed in Pujehun, the estimated probability of eliminating an otherwise large EVD outbreak is close to 100%.Containment of EVD in Pujehun district is ascribable to both the natural history of the disease (mainly transmitted through physical contacts, long generation time, overdispersed distribution of secondary cases per single primary case) and intervention measures (isolation of cases and contact tracing), which in turn strongly depend on preparedness, population awareness, and compliance. Our findings are also essential to determine a successful ring vaccination strategy."
12111650,"Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) is a rare B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder. Previous epidemiological studies have mainly focused on cases derived from single institutions or from localized cancer registries. This is the first study in which all cases diagnosed nationwide over a long period of time in a well defined population are analysed. We report the epidemiology of all HCL patients in Iceland, their clinical characteristics, treatment and follow-up.: All patients diagnosed with HCL in Iceland over a 20 year period, were included in this study. Data was collected retrospectively.Sixteen patients, 13 males and three females were diagnosed with HCL in Iceland from 1981-2000, giving a mean incidence of 4.7/million/year (95% CI: 2.7-7.6) in the population 20 years and older. Eleven patients were treated with a purine analogue, 10 of whom achieved CR. One other patient obtained CR following splenectomy and IFN, giving a total CR rate of 69%. Three other patients (19%) obtained PR, giving a total response rate of 88%. One patient had a variant of HCL and did not respond to any therapy and one patient died of sepsis before any chemotherapy could be given. Six patients with HCL have died, one from complications of HCL. Three patients developed a second malignancy (19%).The mean incidence of HCL in Iceland is 4.7/million/year. This is slighty higher than the reported incidence in England and Wales, although not significantly higher. The incidence is based on a nationwide information from a well defined stable and racially homogenous island population. Other results are in accordance with previously published studies."
3423207,"Six thousand three hundred and six cases of achalasia were admitted to hospital in Britain and Ireland over a 10-year period. The majority (4920) came from England. The disease was significantly more common in Eire than England, Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland. The prevalence in a 10-year period of 13.4/10(5) in Eire was based on 453 cases. Checks on the accuracy of prevalences collected in this manner showed them to be within 2.5 per cent of the actual figure. Studies of age-specific incidence in Scotland and Oxford showed a close correlation between the regions and between men and women. Achalasia is most common in Eire and its incidence increases with age."
19968031,"Epidemiological data concerning pituitary adenomas are very scarce and in some cases reports are even conflicting. This opinion is at present disputed. The aim of this study was, therefore, to evaluate in the urban area of Fribourg, the prevalence of relevant clinical pituitary adenoma. General practitioners, endocrinologists and gynaecologists were questioned concerning any patient within this agglomeration presenting with a pituitary micro- or macro-adenoma. Among the 44 adenomas, we observed 13 non secreting macro-adenomas, 16 micro- and 9 macro-prolactinomas, 4 cases of acromegaly and 2 ACTH-dependant Cushing diseases. In the studied area we found a prevalence of 80.5 pituitary adenomas per 100,000, or 1 case per 1241 corroborating a greater prevalence of pituitary adenomas than previously believed."

19197972,"BACKGROUND:Osteosarcoma, which is the most common primary bone tumor, occurs most frequently in adolescents, but there is a second incidence peak among individuals aged > 60 years. Most osteosarcoma epidemiology studies have been embedded in large analyses of all bone tumors or focused on cases occurring in adolescence. Detailed descriptions of osteosarcoma incidence and survival with direct comparisons among patients of all ages and ethnicities are not available. METHODS:Frequency, incidence, and survival rates for 3482 patients with osteosarcoma from the National Cancer Institute's population-based Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program between 1973 and 2004 were investigated by age (ages 0-24 years, 25-59 years, and 60 to > or = 85 years), race, sex, pathology subtype, stage, and anatomic site. RESULTS:There were large differences in incidence and survival rates by age. There was a high percentage of osteosarcoma with Paget disease and osteosarcoma as a second or later cancer among the elderly. There was a high percentage of osteosarcoma among patients with Paget disease and osteosarcoma as a second or later cancer among the elderly. Tumor site differences among age groups were noted. Survival rates varied by anatomic site and disease stage and did not improve significantly from 1984 to 2004. CONCLUSIONS:This comprehensive, population-based description of osteosarcoma, identified important differences in incidence, survival, pathologic subtype, and anatomic site among age groups, and quantified the impact of osteosarcoma in patients with Paget disease or as a second cancer on incidence and mortality rates. These findings may have implications in understanding osteosarcoma biology and epidemiology."
8825928,"The incidence of phenylketonuria (PKU) in Finland is extremely low, probably below 1 in 100,000. We describe the mutations and haplotypes in all four presently known patients. Mutation R408W was found on four mutant chromosomes (all haplotype 2), and IVS7nt1, R261Q, and IVS2nt1 were each found on a single chromosome. No mutation was found on the remaining chromosome. These findings support a pronounced negative founder effect as the cause of the low incidence of PKU in Finland, and are consistent with existing data regarding the European and Baltic origin of Finnish genes."
25198372,"BACKGROUND: Posterior urethral valves (PUV) are a common cause of chronic kidney disease in young children, yet there is a paucity of knowledge about etiology and incidence. We sought to determine the incidence in Australia and to explore whether any demographic features were associated with incidence. METHODS: PUV cases born between 2004 and 2009 in New South Wales (NSW) were identified by linkage analysis of two registries. The incidence rate was compared to registries from two other states. An audit was then performed at two pediatric centers. RESULTS: Seventy-one boys were born and diagnosed in NSW with PUV, giving a live-birth incidence of 1.28 per 10,000. Fifty-one cases were treated at the two participating centers. Fifty-three percent of these were suspected on antenatal ultrasound. Of the remaining cases, 45% were detected in the neonatal period, with 50% of all postnatal cases presenting with urinary tract infection. No association was observed between maternal factors or socioeconomic status and PUV incidence. CONCLUSION: PUV was found in 1 in 7,800, a similar rate to international studies. Although almost half of cases are antenatally detected, a significant proportion present outside the neonatal period. Birth incidence was not associated with maternal or demographic factors."
24326217,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Population-based studies of the clinical course of autoimmune hepatitis are scarce. We conducted a nationwide study of incidence, prevalence, prognosis, and causes of death of autoimmune hepatitis in Denmark. METHODS: From nationwide healthcare registries we identified all Danish citizens diagnosed with autoimmune hepatitis in 1994-2012 and their liver biopsy data. We followed patients through January 2013 and examined age-standardized incidence and prevalence, mortality, prognostic factors, risk of hepatocellular carcinoma, and causes of death. We used Cox regression to compare patients' mortality relative to a gender- and age-matched general population sample. RESULTS: We included 1721 autoimmune hepatitis patients. The incidence rate was 1.68 (95% confidence interval 1.60 to 1.76) per 100,000 population per year, and it doubled during the study period. Of the 1318 patients who were biopsied at diagnosis, 28.3% had cirrhosis. The 10-year cumulative risk of hepatocellular carcinoma was 0.7% (95% confidence interval 0.3 to 1.5). Male gender and cirrhosis were associated with high mortality and development of hepatocellular carcinoma. In the first year after diagnosis, patients with autoimmune hepatitis had six-fold higher mortality than the general population; later, their mortality remained two-fold higher. Their 10-year cumulative mortality was 26.4% (95% confidence interval 23.7 to 29.1). 38.6% of deaths were liver-related including 3.6% from hepatocellular carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: This nationwide population-based study of autoimmune hepatitis showed that the incidence increased during 1994-2012, and that the disease remains associated with a high mortality, particularly in the first year after diagnosis. Male gender and cirrhosis were adverse prognostic factors."
12051967,"Research on alkaptonuria (AKU; OMIM # 230500) in Slovakia started in 1968 by the Research Laboratory (later on the Institute) for Clinical Genetics at Martin. Its first stage was focused on clinical, biochemical, genetic and epidemiologic questions and on the reasons for the high prevalence of AKU in Slovakia. Based on a screening programme of now over 611,000 inhabitants (509,000 newborns) the world-wide highest incidence of AKU (1 in 19,000) was recorded, and a total of 208 patients (110 children) were registered. Extensive genealogical studies (sometimes over two centuries) resulted in the fusion of several ""unrelated"" nuclear families into larger pedigrees and enabled tracing most AKU ancestors to their original geographic localities, predominantly in remote mountain areas. A likely founder effect was detected among the shepherd population of the so-called Valachian colonization that resulted in a high degree of inbreeding and persisting genetic isolation. These epidemiologic data formed the basis for molecular studies in collaboration with the Würzburg group. The AKU locus was mapped to human chromosome 3q2 by orthology to the mouse locus aku. Following the cloning of the homogentisate-1,2 dioxygenase (HGD) genes from human and mouse, nine different mutations were identified in 21 AKU index patients. These include 4 missense, 2 splice-site, 2 single-base insertion and 1 deletion mutation. The most frequent mutations among the 42 AKU chromosomes of the index cases are c.648G > A (Gly161Arg; 42.9%), and c.1278insC (Pro370fs; 19.1%). To date, the genotypes of 29 patients and of 74 gene carriers from 21 families have been established. The highest prevalence and allelic heterogeneity were observed in the Kysuce district with five different mutations. Molecular epidemiology studies by haplotyping were carried out to uncover the original geographic localities of all AKU index chromosomes. This strongly suggests that several founders have contributed to the HGD gene mutation pool. While there is no straightforward explanation for the clustering of independent mutations, the genetic isolation in the past is likely to be responsible for the high prevalence of AKU in Slovakia."
25432123,"Infective endocarditis (IE) is a life-threatening disease associated with serious complications. The GBD 2010 (Global Burden of Disease, Injuries, and Risk Factors) study IE expert group conducted a systematic review of IE epidemiology literature to inform estimates of the burden on IE in 21 world regions in 1990 and 2010. The disease model of IE for the GBD 2010 study included IE death and 2 sequelae: stroke and valve surgery. Several medical and science databases were searched for IE epidemiology studies in GBD high-, low-, and middle-income regions published between 1980 and 2008. The epidemiologic parameters of interest were IE incidence, proportions of IE patients who developed stroke or underwent valve surgery, and case fatality. Literature searches yielded 1,975 unique papers, of which 115 published in 10 languages were included in the systematic review. Eligible studies were population-based (17%), multicenter hospital-based (11%), and single-center hospital-based studies (71%). Population-based studies were reported from only 6 world regions. Data were missing or sparse in many low- and middle-income regions. The crude incidence of IE ranged between 1.5 and 11.6 cases per 100,000 people and was reported from 10 countries. The overall mean proportion of IE patients that developed stroke was 0.158 ± 0.091, and the mean proportion of patients that underwent valve surgery was 0.324 ± 0.188. The mean case fatality risk was 0.211 ± 0.104. A systematic review for the GBD 2010 study provided IE epidemiology estimates for many world regions, but highlighted the lack of information about IE in low- and middle-income regions. More complete knowledge of the global burden of IE will require improved IE surveillance in all world regions."
24398797,"Sickle cell disease (SCD) does not occur in the indigenous German population. However, with the increasing numbers of immigrants its prevalence is steadily rising. Nevertheless, robust epidemiological data is not available for Germany and, consequently, the German newborn screening (NBS) program does not include SCD. Between 1 September 2011 and 30 November 2012, an unselected cohort of 34,084 Berlin newborns was tested for SCD. The results of 14 newborns were consistent with SCD and 265 babies were identified as hemoglobin S (Hb S) carriers. These data indicate a 95% probability that the incidence of SCD in Berlin is at least 2.5/10,000."
24439603,"PURPOSE: This study evaluates the incidence trends and clinical outcomes of children with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and assesses factors predictive of patient survival. METHODS: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registry was queried from 1973 to 2009 for all patients between ages 0 and 19 with primary HCC. Demographics, tumor histology, surgical intervention, and patient survival were collected. RESULTS: Overall, 218 patients were identified. The annual age-adjusted incidence was 0.05 cases per 100,000 in 2009. Fibrolamellar subtype tumors were exclusive to children >5years old and exhibited greater survival compared to non-fibrolamellar subtype (57% vs. 28%, respectively, p=0.002). Tumor extirpation for patients with resectable disease significantly improved overall survival at 5years compared to no surgery (60% vs. 0%, respectively, p<0.0001). Overall 5-, 10- and 20-year survival for the entire cohort was 24%, 23%, and 8%, respectively. Independent prognostic factors of lower mortality according to multivariate analysis were surgical resection (hazard ratio (HR)=0.18), non-Hispanic ethnicity (HR=0.52), and local disease at presentation (HR=0.46). CONCLUSION: Over the past four decades, the incidence of HCC has remained relatively stable. Children of Hispanic ethnicity have high mortality rates. However, HCC resection for curative intent significantly improves outcomes."
10617747,"OBJECTIVE:To determine how many children with specific types of inborn errors of metabolism are born each year in British Columbia, Canada. This population provides a relatively unique setting for collection of accurate and uniform incidence data because the diagnoses are all made through one laboratory in a population with universal access to government-funded medical care. METHODOLOGY:We used the records of the Biochemical Diseases Laboratory, Children's Hospital, Vancouver (the central referral point for all metabolic diagnoses in British Columbia) to identify all patients diagnosed with the metabolic diseases defined below. We obtained incidence figures by including only the children diagnosed with the diseases covered in this article who were confirmed as having been born within the province for the years 1969 to 1996. The diseases covered were diseases of amino acids, organic acids, the urea cycle, galactosemia, primary lactic acidoses, glycogen storage diseases, lysosomal storage diseases, and diseases involving specifically peroxisomal and mitochondrial respiratory chain dysfunction. Because the technology needed for diagnosis of specific disease groups was in place at different times our data for the different disease groups correspond to different time frames. We have also adjusted the time frames used to allow for the likelihood that some diseases may not come to medical attention for some time after birth. For instance the incidence of amino acid diseases was assessed throughout the whole of this time frame but the incidence of peroxisomal diseases was restricted to 1984 to 1996 because this was the time frame during which the technology needed for diagnosis was in place and reliable. Most disease group statistics included at least 400 000 births. RESULTS:The overall minimum incidence of the metabolic diseases surveyed in children born in British Columbia is approximately 40 cases per 100 000 live births. This includes phenylketonuria (PKU) and galactosemia which are detected by a newborn screening program. Metabolic diseases, which were not screened for at birth, ie, those with PKU and galactosemia subtracted from the total, have a minimal incidence of approximately 30 cases per 100 000 live births. This diagnostic dilemma group would present to pediatricians for diagnosis. Not all metabolic diseases have been surveyed and our data are restricted to the following metabolic disease groups. Approximately 24 children per 100 000 births (approximately 60% of the total disease groups surveyed) have a disease involving amino acids (including PKU), organic acids, primary lactic acidosis, galactosemia, or a urea cycle disease. These children all have metabolic diseases involving small molecules. Approximately 2.3 children per 100 000 births ( approximately 5%) have some form of glycogen storage disease. Approximately 8 per 100 000 births (20%) have a lysosomal storage disease; approximately 3 per 100 000 births (7%-8%) have a respiratory chain-based, mitochondrial disease and approximately 3 to 4 per 100 000 (7%-8%) of births have a peroxisomal disease. The diseases involving subcellular organelles represent approximately half of the diagnostic dilemma group. The incidence of each of the specific diseases diagnosed, including apparently rare diseases such as nonketotic hyperglycinemia, is to be found in the text. The metabolic diseases reported in this survey represent over 10% of the total number of single gene disorders in our population. CONCLUSIONS:Our data provide a good estimate of metabolic disease incidence, for the disease groups surveyed, in a predominantly Caucasian population. Incidence data for metabolic diseases are hard to collect because in very few centers are diagnoses centralized for a population with uniform access to modern health care and this has been the case for our population during the course of the study.

10636128,"OBJECTIVE:To estimate the incidence of meningiomatosis and schwannomatosis, and their familial occurrences and relation to type 2 neurofibromatosis (NF2) in a well-defined population. METHODS:Patients with histologically verified intracranial, spinal, or peripheral schwannomas or meningiomas, who were residents of the Helsinki University Hospital catchment area (population, 1,713,000) from January 1, 1985, to December 31, 1995, were included in the study. The Population Register Center was used to identify relatives of all the patients, and their data were linked further to the Finnish Cancer Registry to find NF2-related tumors. Detailed pedigrees were constructed for the patients with NF2, schwannomatosis, meningiomatosis, patients with relatives with histologically verified schwannomas or meningiomas, and patients younger than 25 years of age at the time of diagnosis. RESULTS:Approximately 3% (12 of 455) of the schwannoma patients had multiple schwannomas in association with NF2, and 2% (11 of 455) had schwannomatosis without NF2. Two of the patients with schwannomatosis (2 of 11) had familial schwannomatosis. Approximately 1% (7 of 823) of the patients with meningioma had multiple meningiomas in association with NF2, and 4% (29 of 823) had meningiomatosis without NF2. No families with meningiomatosis were found among the 823 patients with meningioma studied. The birth occurrence of NF2 was 1 in 87,410. CONCLUSIONS:The current diagnostic criteria of type 2 neurofibromatosis (NF2) seem valid because NF2 patients were differentiated rather easily from patients with sporadic schwannomatosis and meningiomatosis. Familial meningiomatosis, if it truly exists, is very rare, and familial schwannomatosis is uncommon."
18463126,"Mucopolysaccharidosis type 1 (MPS1) is an autosomal recessive disorder with severe, moderate and mild phenotypes: Hurler, Hurler-Scheie and Scheie syndromes. We estimated incidence (2001-2006) and prevalence (2002 census) of MPS1 in the Irish Republic (ROI) using population data, database and chart review of all live MPS1 patients attending two specialised centres. Patient genotypes, ethnicity, province of origin, age at diagnosis and presenting features were recorded. Thirty-one patients (14 females, 17 males) were alive, 27 of whom were <15 years. Twenty-six patients had Hurler syndrome, four had Hurler-Scheie and one had Scheie syndrome. The birth incidence was 1 in 26 206 births with a carrier frequency of 1 in 81. Of note, 19/26 (73%) Hurler patients were Irish Travellers. Amongst Irish Travellers the incidence was 1 in 371 with a carrier frequency of 1 in 10. This is the highest recorded incidence worldwide. Given the morbidity and mortality associated with delayed treatment we recommend targeted newborn screening for this population."
20108376,"The differential diagnosis of parkinsonian disorders is difficult, especially early in the course of the diseases. The clinical subtypes of Parkinson's disease (PD) have not so far been described in newly diagnosed patients. We present a prospective incidence cohort study of patients with idiopathic parkinsonian syndromes in the Umeå region in northern Sweden identified over a 4-year period. The clinical diagnoses were re-evaluated at follow-up visits at 12 months. We found 138 patients with parkinsonism: 112 PD, 12 multiple system atrophy with predominant parkinsonism (MSA-P), six progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and eight unclassifiable patients. The crude incidences for all age ranges per 100,000 were: PD 19.7 (95% confidence interval 16.1-23.3); MSA-P 2.1 (1.1-3.7); PSP 1.1 (0.4-2.4); idiopathic parkinsonism 24.3 (20.2-28.4). Age-standardized to the average Swedish population 2004-2007: PD 22.5 (18.3-26.7); MSA-P 2.4 (1.2-4.2); PSP 1.2 (0.4-2.6); idiopathic parkinsonism 27.5 (22.9-32.1). The crude annual incidence rate for PD, with exclusion of patients with normal dopamine receptor uptake (FP-CIT-SPECT), was 18.8 per 100,000 (95% confidence interval 15.2-22.4), age-adjusted to the average Swedish population 2004 to 2007: 21.5 (17.4-25.6). The incidence rates did not differ significantly between men and women. The cumulative incidence of PD up to 89 years of age was for men 3.4%, for women 2.6%, and for both sexes combined 2.9%. The annual incidence rates found for PD, idiopathic parkinsonism, MSA-P and PSP are among the highest reported."
17826651,"OBJECTIVE: To examine trends in the incidence of primary, malignant penile cancer in the United States. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 1,817 men with primary, malignant penile cancer diagnosed between 1973 and 2002 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program Public-use data were used for analysis. Incidence rates were calculated by clinical and demographic variables of interest and decade of diagnosis (1973-1982, 1983-1992, and 1993-2002) using Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results-Stat 6.1, and trends were examined using the annual percent change statistic. Additional incidence calculations were performed to examine further racial/ethnic differences. RESULTS: The overall incidence of primary, malignant penile cancer from 1973 to 2002 was 0.69 per 100,000. Incidence decreased significantly over time: 0.84 per 100,000 in 1973-1982 to 0.69 per 100,000 in 1982-1992 to 0.58 per 100,000 in 1993-2002. Incidence increased with increasing age at diagnosis. The majority of cases had squamous cell carcinomas, graded as I or II, and originated at the glans penis. Incidence of unknown grade primary, malignant penile cancer decreased significantly over the last 30 years, as did incidence of primary site penis, not otherwise specified primary, malignant penile cancer. The incidence of regional stage disease also increased over time. From 1993 to 2002, White Hispanics had the highest incidence rates (1.01 per 100,000) followed by Alaska Native/American Indians (0.77 per 100,000) and Blacks (0.62 per 100,000). CONCLUSIONS: The overall incidence of primary, malignant penile cancer in the United States has decreased, and these rates varied by race/ethnicity. Incidence rates increased with increasing age at diagnosis, and the incidence of regional stage disease increased over time, while incidence of unknown grade primary, malignant penile cancer decreased over the last 30 years."
10466417,"A molecular genetics-based epidemiological investigation was carried out in 1997 in the territory of North-West Tuscany, central Italy, to calculate incidence and prevalence rates of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD). Results were compared with a previous epidemiological study conducted in the same area in 1981, in the pre-dystrophin era. Routine adoption of methods of molecular diagnosis determined an increase in prevalence of BMD from 1.06 x 10(-5) to 2.42 x 10(-5) inhabitants, while cumulative incidence of DMD was markedly decreased from 23.12 x 10(-5) during the period 1965-1976 to 10.71 x 10(-5) male live births during the period 1977 1994. The combined reduction of DMD/BMD diagnostic error rate and familial recurrence could explain these results, providing the bases for a consistent redefinition of dystrophinopathy carrier frequency in the area considered."
17190629,"Acrodermatitis enteropathica is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of zinc deficiency. The genetic defect has been mapped to 8q24 and the defective gene identified as SLC39A4, which encodes the zinc transporter Zip4. The diagnosis is made by way of clinical presentation together with histopathology and laboratory tests. Here we provide an overview of zinc metabolism and a description of inherited and acquired zinc deficiency."
9724012,"OBJECTIVES:To assess the prevalence of Kennedy's disease in the Vasa region of Western Finland. PATIENTS AND METHODS:Verification of diagnosis by molecular genetic techniques since 1995. RESULTS:Within 2 years we have been able to identify a large number of families with this disorder. We have arrived at a point prevalence of Kennedy's disease in the district of Vasa Central Hospital of 13 patients per 85,000 male inhabitants. Assuming an even distribution throughout the country, this would suggest hundreds of patients with this disorder in Finland. CONCLUSION:Kennedy's disease is the most common motor neuron disorder in the Vasa region, exceeding the prevalence of ALS by a factor of two, and far more common than any of the other motor neuron disorders. The fact that none of our patients, despite previous examinations, had correct diagnoses before 1995, indicates that Kennedy's disease still might be relatively underdiagnosed."
8275976,"Each year, about 150,000 children and adolescents in the United States will come to medical attention for evaluation of a newly occurring seizure disorder of some type. Between 2% and 4% of all children in Europe and the United States experience at least one convulsion associated with a febrile illness before the age of 5 years. The cumulative incidence of febrile convulsions among children ranges from about 1% in China to more than 8% in Japan and 14% in Guam. The peak incidence of a first febrile convulsion occurs in the second year of life. Between 0.5% and 1% of children and adolescents experience a seizure associated with other acute metabolic or neurologic insults; most of these occur in the neonatal period. The incidence of epilepsy (recurrent unprovoked seizures) in children and adolescents seems relatively consistent across all populations studied, ranging from 50 to 100/100,000. The highest incidence of epilepsy is in the first year of life. West syndrome accounts for about 2% of all childhood epilepsy. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome for 1-2%, childhood absence epilepsy (pyknolepsy) for 10-15%, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy for 5%, and idiopathic localization-related epilepsy for 10%. Between 0.5 and 1% of children experience a nonrecurrent, single, unprovoked convulsive episode. Following are the estimated numbers of children and adolescents with newly diagnosed convulsive disorders in the United States for the year 1990: febrile seizures, 100,000; neonatal seizures, 4,000; other provoked seizures, 6,000; single unprovoked seizures, 10,000; and epilepsy, 30,000."
20565885,"BACKGROUND: The aim was to collate all myasthenia gravis (MG) epidemiological studies including AChR MG and MuSK MG specific studies. To synthesize data on incidence rate (IR), prevalence rate (PR) and mortality rate (MR) of the condition and investigate the influence of environmental and technical factors on any trends or variation observed. METHODS: Studies were identified using multiple sources and meta-analysis performed to calculate pooled estimates for IR, PR and MR. RESULTS: 55 studies performed between 1950 and 2007 were included, representing 1.7 billion population-years. For All MG estimated pooled IR (eIR): 5.3 per million person-years (C.I.:4.4, 6.1), range: 1.7 to 21.3; estimated pooled PR: 77.7 per million persons (C.I.:64.0, 94.3), range 15 to 179; MR range 0.1 to 0.9 per millions person-years. AChR MG eIR: 7.3 (C.I.:5.5, 7.8), range: 4.3 to 18.0; MuSK MG IR range: 0.1 to 0.32. However marked variation persisted between populations studied with similar methodology and in similar areas. CONCLUSIONS: We report marked variation in observed frequencies of MG. We show evidence of increasing frequency of MG with year of study and improved study quality. This probably reflects improved case ascertainment. But other factors must also influence disease onset resulting in the observed variation in IR across geographically and genetically similar populations."
23232683,"OBJECTIVE: To present the incidence and spectrum of anorectal malformations (ARMs) and associated anomalies, and to compare the findings with published literature. METHODS: This is a retrospective study conducted during the period January 2011 to December 2011. We reviewed the medical charts of all cases with ARMs admitted to Al-Madinah Maternity and Children Hospital, Madinah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia during 1998-2010. The incidence and spectrum of ARMs, associated regional anomalies, and those with a positive family history of ARMs were identified. The 95% confidence interval and Chi square trend test were used to quantify the significance of variation in annual incidence. RESULTS: One hundred and eighty-eight cases of ARMs were detected from 189,145 live births with an incidence of approximately 1/1000 live births with a male-to-female ratio of 1.9:1. The incidence showed yearly stability (p=0.3509). The most common ARMs was perineal fistula (32.9%). There was a statistically significant gender difference (p=0.000). The most common in boys was rectourethral fistula (47.2%) and in girls was vestibular fistula (46.2%). Isolated non-familial ARMs was found in 106 (56.3%), isolated familial 9 (4.7%), and associated ARMs in 73 (38.8%) cases. In terms of associated anomalies, genitourinary (34%), and cardiovascular (19.2%) systems reported a high incidence. CONCLUSION: The incidence of ARMs in Madinah Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, is higher than the reported data. Isolated ARMs was more common than the associated category, and the familial one was rarely reported."
24572009,"BACKGROUND: Transthyretin-associated Familial Amyloid Polyneuropathy (TTR-FAP) is an autosomal dominant disease caused by the deposition of abnormal transthyretin that results from a gene mutation. Although rare worldwide, there are descriptions of several endemic foci, such as in Majorca, Balearic Islands, Spain. We aimed at describing a contemporary series of TTR-FAP patients in Son Llàtzer Hospital in Majorca from an epidemiological point of view in order to report their main clinical and laboratory characteristics. METHODS: A retrospective, observational study was performed. Medical records from adult patients diagnosed with TTR-FAP from a single hospital were reviewed. RESULTS: Out of a total of 107 cases, 75 subjects were included: asymptomatic carriers (52.3%) and symptomatic patients (47.7%). Mean age was 58.3 years at the time of the study, and 50.7% were men. Mean age at diagnosis was 49.8 years. In addition, 42 patients (39.2%) had received a liver transplant, and time to liver transplantation was on average 29.56 months from the initial diagnosis. They all had the Val30Met mutation. The organs of the nervous system were those most frequently impaired (57.3%), and 83.9% of the symptomatic patients were fully ambulant (stage 1). Family history was reported in 69.3% of the cases, with the patient's father being the most commonly affected relative. Comorbidities were frequent, with high blood pressure being the most common. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide additional information on this condition and are useful for describing the demographic features, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and natural course of TTR-FAP in Majorca."
11953730,"OBJECTIVE:To estimate at the national level the overall and disease-specific incidence of inborn errors of metabolism not mass screened at birth. STUDY DESIGN:Prospective nonconcurrent study (1985-1997) on patients 0 to 17 years of age, diagnosed in 23 Italian pediatric reference centers. RESULTS:Cases (n = 1935) were recruited representing an incidence of 1:3707 live births for approximately 200 diseases. In the last 5 years the incidence was 1:2758, reflecting improved diagnostic facilities, better coverage, increased medical awareness, and newly discovered diseases. In this period, the most frequent classes of diseases were lysosomal storage disease, 1:8275; disorders of carbohydrate metabolism, 1:19,532; organic acidopathies, 1:21,422; and primary lactic acidemias, 1:27,106. The most frequent individual diseases were Gaucher type I, 1:40,247; glycogenosis type 1a, 1:57,746; methylmalonic acidurias, 1:61,775; and ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency, 1:69,904. The incidence of diseases potentially identifiable with the use of a new neonatal mass screening technique is 1:6200. Of surviving patients, 11% reached adulthood by the end of the study. CONCLUSIONS:Inborn errors of metabolism constitute a highly heterogeneous category of rare diseases, representing a relevant cause of morbidity and mortality in childhood. This study quantifies the minimum size of the disease burden, providing useful tools for public health and health policy planning."
20880179,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: The etiology of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is unknown, and limited epidemiological data are available. Our aim was to perform a population based epidemiological study of AIH in Canterbury, New Zealand. METHODS: To calculate point prevalence, all adult and pediatric outpatient clinics and hospital discharge summaries were searched to identify all cases of AIH in the Canterbury region. Incident cases were recruited prospectively in 2008. Demographic and clinical data were extracted from case notes. Both the original revised AIH criteria and the simplified criteria were applied and cases were included in the study if they had definite or probable AIH. RESULTS: When the original revised criteria were used, 138 cases (123 definite and 14 probable AIH), were identified. Prospective incidence in 2008 was 2.0/100,000 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.8-3.3/100,000). Point prevalence on 31 December 2008 was 24.5/100,000 (95% CI 20.1-28.9). Age-standardized (World Health Organization standard population) incidence and prevalence were 1.7 and 18.9 per 100,000, respectively. Gender-specific prevalence confirmed a female predominance, while ethnicity-specific prevalence showed higher prevalence in Caucasians. 72% of cases presented after 40 years of age and the peak age of presentation was in the sixth decade of life. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first and largest population-based epidemiology study of AIH in a geographically defined region using standardized inclusion criteria. The observed incidence and prevalence rates are among the highest reported. The present study confirms that AIH presents predominantly in older women, with a peak in the sixth decade, contrary to the classical description of the disease."
18713229,"To estimate the population-based incidence of erythromelalgia. Background Only one report describing the incidence of erythromelalgia has been published previously.A population-based analysis of data from the Rochester Epidemiology Project.Tertiary care medical centre in Olmsted County, Minnesota (a rural county in the south-eastern portion of the state).Thirty-three residents of Olmsted County with a diagnosis of erythromelalgia during the study period.Age- and sex-specific incidence rates of erythromelalgia were determined.None.Population-based incidence rate.The overall age- and sex-adjusted incidence rate (95% confidence interval, 95% CI) was 1.3 (0.8-1.7) per 100,000 people per year. The incidence of primary and secondary erythromelalgia was 1.1 (0.7-1.5) and 0.2 (0.02-0.4) per 100,000 people per year, respectively. The age-adjusted incidence rates (95% CI) were 2.0 (1.2-2.7) per 100,000 women and 0.6 (0.1-1.1) per 100,000 men. The study was limited by the small sample size and potential variability in recognition of erythromelalgia.The population-based incidence of erythromelalgia has increased with each decade in Olmsted County over the past three decades; overall incidence was 1.3 per 100,000 people per year, approximately 5 times higher than previously reported."
16308995,"BACKGROUND: The epidemiology of primary biliary cirrhosis has changed significantly over the last decade, with a trend towards increasing prevalence in many places around the world. OBJECTIVES: To determine the overall prevalence of PBC in southern Israel and the specific rates for different immigrant groups between January 1993 and October 2004. METHODS: Multiple case-finding methods were used to identify all cases of PBC in the study region. Age-adjusted prevalence rates were compared among the different immigrant groups. RESULTS: A total of 47 cases of PBC were identified with an overall prevalence of 55 cases per million. All patients were women, and all except for a Bedouin Arab were Jewish. Foreign-born patients comprised 70% of our PBC cohort even though they represent only 45.4% of the regional population. This predominance of immigrants did not change when the rates were adjusted for age (P < 0.001). The prevalence rates were 40, 177, and 58 cases per million for those born in Israel, North Africa or Asia, and Eastern Europe, respectively. The age-specific prevalence rate for women older than 40 years varied from 135 cases per million among those born in Israel to 450 among immigrants from Eastern Europe and the former USSR to 700 cases per million among immigrants from North Africa and Asia. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of PBC in southern Israel is similar to that reported from some European countries. The rate is much higher among Jews than Arabs and among immigrants to Israel compared to native Israelis."
22894767,"Zellweger syndrome (ZS) is a peroxisome biogenesis disorder due to mutations in any one of 13 PEX genes. Increased incidence of ZS has been suspected in French-Canadians of the Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean region (SLSJ) of Quebec, but this remains unsolved.We identified 5 ZS patients from SLSJ diagnosed by peroxisome dysfunction between 1990-2010 and sequenced all coding exons of known PEX genes in one patient using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) for diagnostic confirmation.A homozygous mutation (c.802_815del, p.[Val207_Gln294del, Val76_Gln294del]) in PEX6 was identified and then shown in 4 other patients. Parental heterozygosity was confirmed in all. Incidence of ZS was estimated to 1 in 12,191 live births, with a carrier frequency of 1 in 55. In addition, we present data suggesting that this mutation abolishes a SF2/ASF splice enhancer binding site, resulting in the use of two alternative cryptic donor splice sites and predicted to encode an internally deleted in-frame protein.We report increased incidence of ZS in French-Canadians of SLSJ caused by a PEX6 founder mutation. To our knowledge, this is the highest reported incidence of ZS worldwide. These findings have implications for carrier screening and support the utility of NGS for molecular confirmation of peroxisomal disorders."
11202238,"This study represents the first national epidemiological survey of primary immunodeficiency diseases in Norway. Uniform questionnaires were sent out in April 1998 to all hospital departments considered relevant. As of February 1999, a total of 372 patients have been registered, of whom 69 patients are deceased. With a population of 4.45 million people, the total prevalence of primary immunodeficiency diseases in Norway February 1, 1999 is 6.82 per 100000 inhabitants. Distribution between the main immunodeficiency diagnoses is (a) antibody deficiencies 50.8%, (b) combined deficiencies included other immunodeficiency syndromes 12.4%, (c) complement deficiencies 21.0%, (d) phagocytic disorders 6.7%, (e) and immunodeficiency associated with other congenital diseases 9. 1%. Compared to previous reports from other European countries, there is a smaller proportion of antibody deficiencies due to few IgA deficiencies registered and a large proportion of complement deficiencies due to many patients with hereditary angioedema."
18565211,"Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a genetic disorder that manifests as pulmonary emphysema, liver cirrhosis and, rarely, as the skin disease panniculitis, and is characterized by low serum levels of AAT, the main protease inhibitor (PI) in human serum. The prevalence in Western Europe and in the USA is estimated at approximately 1 in 2,500 and 1 : 5,000 newborns, and is highly dependent on the Scandinavian descent within the population. The most common deficiency alleles in North Europe are PI Z and PI S, and the majority of individuals with severe AATD are PI type ZZ. The clinical manifestations may widely vary between patients, ranging from asymptomatic in some to fatal liver or lung disease in others. Type ZZ and SZ AATD are risk factors for the development of respiratory symptoms (dyspnoea, coughing), early onset emphysema, and airflow obstruction early in adult life. Environmental factors such as cigarette smoking, and dust exposure are additional risk factors and have been linked to an accelerated progression of this condition. Type ZZ AATD may also lead to the development of acute or chronic liver disease in childhood or adulthood: prolonged jaundice after birth with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia and abnormal liver enzymes are characteristic clinical signs. Cirrhotic liver failure may occur around age 50. In very rare cases, necrotizing panniculitis and secondary vasculitis may occur. AATD is caused by mutations in the SERPINA1 gene encoding AAT, and is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. The diagnosis can be established by detection of low serum levels of AAT and isoelectric focusing. Differential diagnoses should exclude bleeding disorders or jaundice, viral infection, hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease and autoimmune hepatitis. For treatment of lung disease, intravenous alpha-1-antitrypsin augmentation therapy, annual flu vaccination and a pneumococcal vaccine every 5 years are recommended. Relief of breathlessness may be obtained with long-acting bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids. The end-stage liver and lung disease can be treated by organ transplantation. In AATD patients with cirrhosis, prognosis is generally grave."
12213856,"Newborn screening for congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is justified by the sometimes difficult clinical diagnosis and the risks associated with missed diagnosis, particularly the life-threatening salt-wasting crisis. In Switzerland, nationwide screening for CAH by measuring 17-hydroxyprogesterone levels in dried blood spots was introduced in 1992. At the Zurich University Children's Hospital, 50% of the population of Switzerland is screened. The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficiency of the Zurich screening program. Between January 1, 1993, and May 31, 2001, 333,221 newborns were screened for CAH. Thirty-one newborns had CAH (incidence, 1 in 10,749); 30 were detected through screening (sensitivity, 97%). A recall for suspected CAH was performed in only 60 cases, corresponding to a very low recall rate (0.0018%). In 30 recalls CAH was confirmed (positive predictive value, 50%; specificity, 99.99%). Fifteen of 31 patients profited from screening, as CAH had not been recognized clinically. The timely availability of screening results made therapy possible within the first week of life in most cases and helped in preventing salt-wasting crisis in all patients. With a sensitivity of 97%, a specificity of 99.99%, and a positive predictive value of 50%, the Zurich neonatal screening program for CAH can be considered highly reliable."
1395082,"Two hundred and twenty-nine symptomatic patients with retinitis pigmentosa were ascertained in Slovenia between 1986 and 1990. Twenty-three further patients were identified while data from 63 families (82 patients) were being collected. After correction for underascertainment, a prevalence of 1 in 6023 was estimated in the Slovene population (1,999,477 in 1990). The highest prevalence of 1 in 1902 was found in the age group 65 years and older. Of 63 analysed families, 17 (27%) showed autosomal dominant, 13 (21%) autosomal recessive, and one family (1.5%) X-linked inheritance; in 30 families (47.5%) isolated cases were found; and in two families the mode of inheritance was impossible to determine."
6807042,"Ninety-six persons, living in Gothenburg, Sweden, on the first of January 1978 and known by the health services as cases of neurofibromatosis, were investigated concerning clinical and genetic aspects of the disease. Close relatives were also interviewed and examined. The diagnostic criteria were operationally defined according to number of café-au-lait spots and/or neurofibromas. The prevalence of neurofibromatosis was estimated to be 0.02%. The following findings were made in the patients: axillary freckling (48%), neurological symptoms (30%), epilepsy (3-9%), sarcoma (4%), pheochromocytoma (3%), osseous dysplasias (12%), subnormal intelligence (45%) and psychiatric symptoms (33%). The genetic analysis revealed a dominantly inherited disease with full penetrance and a very high mutation frequency, at least 4.3 X 10(-5). Questions commonly encountered during counselling are discussed."
10232748,"A craniomaxillofacial unit was established recently in Western Australia, and a study was carried out to provide some baseline characteristics of primary craniosynostosis in Western Australia and to investigate whether there has been any significant temporal change in birth prevalence. A case control study was conducted, using cases identified from a population-based register of birth defects, and a random sample of all births without a birth defect formed the control group. All subjects were born in Western Australia over the period 1980-1994 inclusive. The prevalence of craniosynostosis over the period 1980-1994 in Western Australia was 5.06 per 10,000 births. There was a significant linear increase in lambdoid synostosis over this period of 15.7% per year. Craniosynostosis was significantly more common among male infants, infants born preterm (<37 weeks gestation), breech presentation or presentations other than vertex, and infants born to fathers 40 years of age or older, even after accounting for known autosomal dominant syndromes. Other major birth defects were found in 11.2% of children with nonsyndromic craniosynostosis. Only 43 children (25.3%) with craniosynostosis were reported to have been seen by a geneticist. Thus, the prevalence of craniosynostosis in Western Australia is among the lowest reported. There is no current explanation for the increase in lambdoid synostosis. The increased risk of so-called nonsyndromic craniosynostosis with paternal age raises the possibility of undiagnosed new dominant mutations. This, along with the excess of other birth defects in children with craniosynostosis emphasises the need to ensure that these families are offered genetic counseling."
23481450,"BACKGROUND: Since 2005, a newborn screening program for congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) by measuring 17-alpha-hydroxyprogesterone (17OHP) in dried blood spots was introduced in Cuba. METHODS: The hormone was measured by the 17OHP Neonatal UMELISA method, in samples collected on the 5th day as average. Confirmatory test was performed to those neonates with 17OHP values above 55 nmol/l. Some perinatal factors that can influence on 17OHP levels were studied. RESULTS: From January 2005 to December 2010, 621,303 newborns were screened and 39 CAH cases were detected. Coverage of the program reached 98%. The incidence of CAH in Cuba was 1:15,931, similar to that reported by other programs. A recall for suspected CAH was performed in 10,799 cases (1.74%). Therapy in classical CAH patients was started at the mean age of 22 days. 17OHP levels were significantly higher in newborns with lower birth-weight (BW) and/or gestational age (GA). In addition, 17OHP values were affected by the gender, twin status or mode of delivery. CONCLUSIONS: In Cuba, the nationwide newborn screening program has allowed the early detection of CAH. The use of an optimized cut-off level for BW or GA could lead to a reduction in the percentage of recalled babies."
11701260,"The incidence of West syndrome (WS) was determined by a search of reports of electroencephalograms (EEG) recorded in 1998 and 1999 in all public hospitals in Singapore. Amongst records of patients born in 1998, nine were found with EEG features of hypsarrhythmia or modified hypsarrhythmia with onset of seizures between January 1,1998 and December 31, 1999. The medical records of these patients were reviewed. The population of children born in 1998 was 43,664. In 1998 and 1999, 67% of all hospital admissions for patients 2 years or younger in Singapore were in public hospitals. The cumulative incidence of WS in Singapore corrected for the percentage of hospital admissions to public hospitals was 3.1/10,000 live births. The corrected cumulative incidences in Chinese, Malays and Indians were 2.7, 3.1 and 3.3 per 10,000, respectively. Three cases were idiopathic; three were due to congenital structural lesions of the brain; one each had periventricular leucomalacia, intracranial hemorrhage and severe intrauterine growth retardation. None of the patients were normal at follow up. The three patients with idiopathic WS had mild global developmental delay and the other six cases had cerebral palsy and severe mental retardation. With the best modern medical treatment, possibly only two of the nine cases of WS may have been prevented."
1756603,"Otological, ophthalmological and genetic studies were performed in 46 patients with Usher syndrome, identified through a screening program in Colombia. Of them, 69.6% had Usher syndrome type I, 26.1% type II, and 4.3% type III. Thirty-three patients showed profound deafness (71.7%), while 13 (28.3%) had moderate to severe hearing loss. The ophthalmologic manifestations showed marked variability. Although the majority of the patients had serious ocular impairment before age 20, 32.6% had good central visual acuity. The prevalence of Usher syndrome in Colombia, estimated at 3.2/100,000, warrants the implementation of screening programs in schools for the deaf and for the blind. Our study confirms that Usher syndrome shows no geographic or racial variation and that the disorder has a wide variability of expression and genetic heterogeneity. The large size of the families we have detected may provide important opportunities for further genetic studies, particularly in terms of the assignment of the locus and gene mapping."
28890442,"OBJECTIVES:Precocious puberty seems to be increasing but epidemiological data are scarce. Our objective was to improve the epidemiologic knowledge on this disease. We analyzed the national incidence and spatial trends of idiopathic central precocious puberty in France in 2011-2013 in a cross-sectional descriptive study. DESIGN:We used an indicator based on treatment reimbursements recorded in the national insurance database, in girls under the age of nine years and in boys under the age of 10 years. We considered a time lag of up to one year from the onset of puberty to first drug delivery. We tested four different predictive spatial models at the département scale, selecting the model best fitting the data. We carried out semi-structured interviews with qualified hospital teams in five selected regions to investigate spatial differences in medical practices. RESULTS:The national annual incidence was 2.68 (95% CI: 2.55, 2.81) per 10 000 girls under the age of 9 years and 0.24 (95% CI: 0.21, 0.27) per 10 000 boys under the age of 10 years. Incidence rates conformed to a purely spatial heterogeneity model in girls, consistent between age groups, with a large incidence range. A similar pattern was observed for boys, with peaks in the South West and Center East. Differences in medical practices may have slightly affected incidence locally, but could not entirely explain the marked geographic pattern. CONCLUSIONS:The results suggest that the risk factors are similar for boys and girls and justify further investigations of the role of the environment."
20700078,"BACKGROUND: Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is a rare inherited phagocytic disorder resulting in an increased susceptibility to infections including invasive fungal diseases (IFDs) and inflammatory complications. This study is aimed at assessing the incidence, prevalence, and outcome of IFDs among CGD patients followed in France. METHODS: CGD patients were identified through the French national registry for primary immunodeficiencies (PID) held by the French national reference Centre of PID (Centre de Référence Déficits Immunitaires Héréditaires), which comprises a total of 3083 patients including 155 with CGD followed between 1976 and 2008. A questionnaire was filled out for each episode of IFD. Information retrieved included a description of the IFD using the 2008 European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group IFD definition criteria. RESULTS: Of CGD patients, 42.6% (66/155) developed at least 1 episode of IFD. Overall incidence of IFD was 0.040/patient-years (1862 patient-years of total follow-up). IFD incidence was found to be significant while receiving itraconazole prophylaxis compared with no prophylaxis (0.027 vs. 0.053 IFD/patient-years; P < 0.01). Median age at IFD diagnosis was 6.5 years (3.3-11.3). The most common fungal genus was Aspergillus sp. accounting for 40% of all IFDs. Of the IFDs, 42.5% were proven, 30.0% probable, and 27.5% possible. Of all IFD episodes, 52.5% were treated by antifungal monotherapy, mostly by amphotericin B. Survival was reduced in IFD patients compared with those without it (log-rank 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: IFDs are a frequent and life-threatening complication in CGD patients. Itraconazole significantly reduces its incidence and should be recommended in absence of better alternatives."
18794710,"To investigate the epidemiology of systemic sclerosis (SSc) in southern Europe, we assessed the incidence, prevalence, clinical spectrum, and survival of patients diagnosed with SSc in the Lugo region of northwestern Spain. Between January 1988 and December 2006, SSc was diagnosed in 78 Lugo residents according to the criteria proposed by LeRoy and Medsger and/or the 1980 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) preliminary criteria for the classification of SSc. However, only 44 (56.4%) of the 78 patients fulfilled the 1980 ACR criteria for the classification of SSc. The mean age at the time of disease diagnosis was 59.8 +/- 13.3 years. Twenty-three (29.5%) met definitions for diffuse SSc (dSSc), and 55 (70.5%) for limited SSc (lSSc). Patients with lSSc had a longer disease duration before the diagnosis (10.2 +/- 12.0 yr) than those with dSSc (3.7 +/- 3.2yr) (p < 0.001). Based on the criteria proposed by LeRoy and Medsger and/or the 1980 ACR criteria for the classification of SSc, the overall age- and sex-adjusted annual incidence rate over the 19-year study period was 2.3 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.6-2.5) per 100,000 population aged 15 yr and older (women: 3.5 [95% CI, 2.3-3.9]; men: 1.0 [95% CI, 0.5-1.4]; p < 0.001). Using only the 1980 ACR criteria for SSc, the total annual-adjusted incidence rate was 1.2 (95% CI, 0.9-1.6) per 100,000 population aged 15 years and older (women: 1.8 [95% CI, 1.2-2.5]; men: 0.7 [95% CI, 0.3-1.2]; p < 0.001). The incidence increased significantly in individuals aged 45 years or older. The overall incidence rates of SSc increased over the length of the study (p for trend in the total incidence < 0.001). This was mainly due to a progressive increase of SSc in women between 1993 and 2002. By December 31, 2006, the overall age-adjusted SSc prevalence in the Lugo region of patients who met the criteria proposed by LeRoy and Medsger and/or the 1980 ACR criteria was 27.7 (95% CI, 21.1-35.84) per 100,000 population aged 15 years and older. Cardiopulmonary complications were the leading cause of death (13 of 20 cases). Compared with that in the general population, the probability of survival in patients with SSc was significantly reduced (p < 0.001).The current study establishes a baseline estimate of the incidence and clinical spectrum of SSc in northwestern Spain. According to our results, the incidence and prevalence of SSc in northwestern Spain are similar to those found in Greece and some regions of the United States. Our data confirm a reduced probability of survival in patients with SSc."
26601850,"What are the long term trends in the total (live births, fetal deaths, and terminations of pregnancy for fetal anomaly) and live birth prevalence of neural tube defects (NTD) in Europe, where many countries have issued recommendations for folic acid supplementation but a policy for mandatory folic acid fortification of food does not exist?This was a population based, observational study using data on 11,353 cases of NTD not associated with chromosomal anomalies, including 4162 cases of anencephaly and 5776 cases of spina bifida from 28 EUROCAT (European Surveillance of Congenital Anomalies) registries covering approximately 12.5 million births in 19 countries between 1991 and 2011. The main outcome measures were total and live birth prevalence of NTD, as well as anencephaly and spina bifida, with time trends analysed using random effects Poisson regression models to account for heterogeneities across registries and splines to model non-linear time trends.Overall, the pooled total prevalence of NTD during the study period was 9.1 per 10,000 births. Prevalence of NTD fluctuated slightly but without an obvious downward trend, with the final estimate of the pooled total prevalence of NTD in 2011 similar to that in 1991. Estimates from Poisson models that took registry heterogeneities into account showed an annual increase of 4% (prevalence ratio 1.04, 95% confidence interval 1.01 to 1.07) in 1995-99 and a decrease of 3% per year in 1999-2003 (0.97, 0.95 to 0.99), with stable rates thereafter. The trend patterns for anencephaly and spina bifida were similar, but neither anomaly decreased substantially over time. The live birth prevalence of NTD generally decreased, especially for anencephaly. Registration problems or other data artefacts cannot be excluded as a partial explanation of the observed trends (or lack thereof) in the prevalence of NTD.In the absence of mandatory fortification, the prevalence of NTD has not decreased in Europe despite longstanding recommendations aimed at promoting peri-conceptional folic acid supplementation and existence of voluntary folic acid fortification.The study was funded by the European Public Health Commission, EUROCAT Joint Action 2011-2013. HD and ML received support from the European Commission DG Sanco during the conduct of this study. No additional data available."
8406517,"Familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP) in Swedish patients is associated with the same transthyretin mutation (TTRMet30) as in Portuguese, Japanese, Brazilian and Majorcan patients. Yet, the age of onset of FAP is much later in Sweden than in other populations. We have studied 239 cases of FAP from northern Sweden, their geographical distribution, differences in age of onset, and estimated prevalence and incidence rates. Cases and families concentrate mainly in two areas, around the towns of Skellefteå and Piteå. Mean age of onset was found to be later in the Piteå (58.8 +/- 10.8) than in the Skellefteå area (54.4 +/- 13.5). Unusually high figures were found for prevalence rates (91 x 10(-5) and 104 x 10(-5), respectively) in 1985. Mean yearly incidences were 3.1 x 10(-5) and 4.4 x 10(-5), respectively, over the period 1985-1989."
11921605,"A nation-wide registration of Danish cases of retinitis pigmentosa (RP) provided 1890 persons diagnosed during the period 1850-1989. Prevalent at 1 January 1988 were 1301 persons (1:3943) comprising a multitude of different RP-types. Age specific prevalence rates demonstrated increasing rates of RP during the first four decades of life and a rather stable prevalence over the next 20-30 years. Corrected for incompleteness, a late decrease was found, reflecting an incomplete ascertainment of the oldest patients. A moving average method indicated an even later steady state value for the age-specific prevalence. The Danish prevalence figures were standardized according to the WHO World Standardized Prevalence Rates and compared with large studies from the USA and UK. No statistically significant difference was found. Usher syndrome was present in 12% of all RP-cases and Bardet-Biedl syndrome comprised 5%. Mental retardation was found in 144 cases (11%), mostly characterized by atypical RP. Nineteen per cent of patients affected by nonsystemic RP had an onset later than 30 years of age, whereas only a few per cent of persons with systemic RP had an RP onset after age 30 years. The Mendelian inheritance type of all cases was evaluated according to an unambiguous genetic classification, finding a larger amount of X-linked RP compared with other studies. Among nonsystemic RP-cases, 14.3% were found to be inherited as an X-linked trait whereas only 8.4% were autosomal dominantly inherited. The largest fraction was, as in previous materials, the simplex group (isolated cases) comprising 42.9% of the nonsystemic RP patients. Some factors influencing the results are discussed, with special emphasis on the problems associated with precise definitions of the Mendelian inheritance groups. A diagram according to the author's definition was constructed as a guideline ready for clinical application."
18642362,"The objective of this study was to characterize the prevalence, demographic risk factors, and malformations associated with agenesis and hypoplasia of the corpus callosum diagnosed in infancy. Using a large population-based registry of birth defects, we ascertained 630 cases of agenesis (ACC) and hypoplasia (HCC) of the corpus callosum diagnosed in the first year of life among 3.4 million live births from 1983 to 2003. Infants with destructive lesions or specific complex central nervous system (CNS) malformations (neural tube defects, lissencephaly, and holoprosencephaly) were excluded. Multivariable Poisson regression analysis was used to examine demographic risk factors. The combined prevalence of ACC and HCC was 1.8 per 10,000 live births. Fifty-two percent of cases were male. Infants with ACC had an almost fourfold higher prevalence among infants born prematurely when compared with children born > or =37 weeks gestation (RR 3.7, 95% CI 2.5-5.3). After adjusting for paternal age, advanced maternal age >/=40 years was associated with ACC in infants with a chromosomal disorder (ACC RR 5.9; 95% CI 1.8-19.3, HCC RR 3.5; 95% CI 0.9-14.1). Paternal age was not significantly associated with ACC after adjusting for maternal age. Callosal anomalies were often seen in the context of a chromosomal abnormality (17.3%) and with accompanying somatic (musculoskeletal 33.5% and cardiac 27.6%) and CNS malformations (49.5%). Callosal anomalies form a clinically significant and relatively frequent group of malformations of the CNS that are associated with increased risk of premature birth, are more common with advanced maternal age and are frequently part of a complex, multisystem disorder."
22002800,"Epidemiologic data on phocomelia are scarce. This study presents an epidemiologic analysis of the largest series of phocomelia cases known to date. Data were provided by 19 birth defect surveillance programs, all members of the International Clearinghouse for Birth Defects Surveillance and Research. Depending on the program, data corresponded to a period from 1968 through 2006. A total of 22,740,933 live births, stillbirths and, for some programs, elective terminations of pregnancy for fetal anomaly (ETOPFA) were monitored. After a detailed review of clinical data, only true phocomelia cases were included. Descriptive data are presented and additional analyses compared isolated cases with those with multiple congenital anomalies (MCA), excluding syndromes. We also briefly compared congenital anomalies associated with nonsyndromic phocomelia with those presented with amelia, another rare severe congenital limb defect. A total of 141 phocomelia cases registered gave an overall total prevalence of 0.62 per 100,000 births (95% confidence interval: 0.52-0.73). Three programs (Australia Victoria, South America ECLAMC, Italy North East) had significantly different prevalence estimates. Most cases (53.2%) had isolated phocomelia, while 9.9% had syndromes. Most nonsyndromic cases were monomelic (55.9%), with an excess of left (64.9%) and upper limb (64.9%) involvement. Most nonsyndromic cases (66.9%) were live births; most isolated cases (57.9%) weighed more than 2,499 g; most MCA (60.7%) weighed less than 2,500 g, and were more likely stillbirths (30.8%) or ETOPFA (15.4%) than isolated cases. The most common associated defects were musculoskeletal, cardiac, and intestinal. Epidemiological differences between phocomelia and amelia highlighted possible differences in their causes."
25526781,"Sporotrichosis is an endemic mycosis caused by the dimorphic fungus Sporothrix schenckii sensu lato. It has gained importance in recent years due to its worldwide prevalence, recognition of multiple cryptic species within the originally described species, and its distinctive ecology, distribution, and epidemiology across the globe. In this review, we describe the current knowledge of the taxonomy, ecology, prevalence, molecular epidemiology, and outbreaks due to S. schenckii sensu lato. Despite its omnipresence in the environment, this fungus has remarkably diverse modes of infection and distribution patterns across the world. We have delved into the nuances of how sporotrichosis is intimately linked to different forms of human activities, habitats, lifestyles, and environmental and zoonotic interactions. The purpose of this review is to stimulate discussion about the peculiarities of this unique fungal pathogen and increase the awareness of clinicians and microbiologists, especially in regions of high endemicity, to its emergence and evolving presentations and to kindle further research into understanding the unorthodox mechanisms by which this fungus afflicts different human populations."
25138334,"Newborn screening for severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) using assays to detect T-cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) began in Wisconsin in 2008, and SCID was added to the national recommended uniform panel for newborn screened disorders in 2010. Currently 23 states, the District of Columbia, and the Navajo Nation conduct population-wide newborn screening for SCID. The incidence of SCID is estimated at 1 in 100,000 births.To present data from a spectrum of SCID newborn screening programs, establish population-based incidence for SCID and other conditions with T-cell lymphopenia, and document early institution of effective treatments.Epidemiological and retrospective observational study.Representatives in states conducting SCID newborn screening were invited to submit their SCID screening algorithms, test performance data, and deidentified clinical and laboratory information regarding infants screened and cases with nonnormal results. Infants born from the start of each participating program from January 2008 through the most recent evaluable date prior to July 2013 were included. Representatives from 10 states plus the Navajo Area Indian Health Service contributed data from 3,030,083 newborns screened with a TREC test.Infants with SCID and other diagnoses of T-cell lymphopenia were classified. Incidence and, where possible, etiologies were determined. Interventions and survival were tracked.Screening detected 52 cases of typical SCID, leaky SCID, and Omenn syndrome, affecting 1 in 58,000 infants (95% CI, 1/46,000-1/80,000). Survival of SCID-affected infants through their diagnosis and immune reconstitution was 87% (45/52), 92% (45/49) for infants who received transplantation, enzyme replacement, and/or gene therapy. Additional interventions for SCID and non-SCID T-cell lymphopenia included immunoglobulin infusions, preventive antibiotics, and avoidance of live vaccines. Variations in definitions and follow-up practices influenced the rates of detection of non-SCID T-cell lymphopenia.Newborn screening in 11 programs in the United States identified SCID in 1 in 58,000 infants, with high survival. The usefulness of detection of non-SCID T-cell lymphopenias by the same screening remains to be determined."
11388594,"UNLABELLED:Newborn screening for biotinidase deficiency (BD) provides prevention of neurological sequelae in patients with low residual enzyme activity by early treatment with oral biotin substitution. Screening 1.1 million newborns in Austria and consecutive family studies led to the identification of 21 patients with profound BD (residual activity <10%) (incidence: 1:59,800) and to 12 patients with partial BD (residual activity 10%-30%) (incidence 1:89,700). Application of an HPLC assay using the natural substrate biocytin allowed exact quantification of extremely low residual biotinidase activities and thus subdivision of patients with profound BD into a group with a residual activity 0%-1% of normal activity (n = 5) and >1%-<10% (n = 16) respectively. Evaluation of clinical and neuropsychological outcome showed that only patients with a biotinidase activity < 1% (n = 3/5) exhibited characteristic clinical symptoms within the first weeks of life, while five patients with a residual activity of 1.2%-4.6% did not develop clinical symptoms even when not treated until 3.5 21 years. In all patients with residual activity <10% and biotin substitution within the first weeks of life, neuropsychological outcome was normal, while abnormal in three out of five patients tested for IQ and treated after the age of 3.5 years. In five out of nine patients with poor compliance or delayed or no treatment, visual and brainstem auditory evoked potentials were measured and were within age-related normal values. All patients with partial BD available for follow-up remained clinically and neuropsychologically asymptomatic without treatment at ages 2.5 10 years. CONCLUSION:The incidence of biotinidase deficiency in Austria is comparable to other European countries. Subdivision of the group of patients with profound biotinidase deficiency suggests that only patients with residual activities < 1% are prone to develop clinical symptoms early in life, while patients with residual activities >1% may remain asymptomatic even without treatment, as do patients with partial deficiency. Moderate mental retardation might represent a possible manifestation of cerebral dysfunction in patients with profound biotinidase deficiency."
15505392,"Acute encephalopathic crisis in glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency results in an unfavourable disease course and poor outcome, dominated by dystonia, feeding problems, seizures and secondary complications, and quite often leading to early death. The prerequisite for the prevention of irreversible brain damage in this disease is the detection of affected patients and initiation of treatment before the manifestation of such crisis. Apart from macrocephaly there are no signs or symptoms characteristic for this disease in presymptomatic children and, thus, they are usually missed. In some countries, implementation of extended neonatal screening programmes using electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) allows detection of affected newborns and start of therapy before onset of neurological complications. This article summarizes recent strategies, pitfalls and shortcomings of a mass screening for glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency using ESI-MS/MS. Furthermore, an alternative strategy, namely DNA-based neonatal screening for the Oji-Cree variant of this disease, is demonstrated. An optimization of diagnostic as well as therapeutic procedures must be achieved before GCDH deficiency unequivocally fulfills the criteria of a reliable and successful newborn screening programme."
22971091,"The infantile-onset axonal neuropathies and neuronopathies are an uncommon and heterogeneous group of conditions causing weakness, wasting, and developmental delay in early childhood. Many are associated with central nervous system or other systemic manifestations and cause early mortality. We review the axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth subtypes with onset in infancy, spinal muscular atrophy, and related syndromes of early infancy, giant axonal neuropathy, infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy, hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy with agenesis of the corpus callosum, early-onset neuropathies associated with mitochondrial disorders, and other less well-delineated clinical entities. Useful clinical and neuropathologic features in the diagnostic work-up of these conditions are also presented."
7719342,"We have examined data on six closely linked microsatellite loci on chromosome 9q34 from 59 Ashkenazi Jewish families with idiopathic torsion dystonia (ITD). Our data show that the vast majority (> 90%) of early-onset ITD cases in the Ashkenazi population are due to a single founder mutation, which we estimate first appeared approximately 350 years ago. We also show that carriers preferentially originate from the northern part of the historic Jewish Pale of settlement (Lithuania and Byelorussia). The recent origin of this dominant mutation and its current high frequency (between 1/6,000 and 1/2,000) suggest that the Ashkenazi population descends from a limited group of founders, and emphasize the importance of genetic drift in determining disease allele frequencies in this population."
16321766,"Muir-Torre syndrome is an autosomal-dominant skin condition of genetic origin, characterised by tumours of the sebaceous gland or keratoacanthoma that are associated with visceral malignant diseases. The cutaneous characteristics of Muir-Torre syndrome are sebaceous adenoma, epithelioma, carcinoma, or multiple keratoacanthomas, whereas visceral malignant diseases include colorectal, endometrial, urological, and upper gastrointestinal tumours. Although Muir-Torre syndrome has a striking familial association and features of autosomal-dominant transmission, it can arise in individuals without a family history or any known mutations. Clinical and biomolecular evidence has suggested that there are two types of Muir-Torre syndrome. The most common is a variant of hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer, which is characterised by defects in mismatch repair genes and early-onset tumours. The second type does not show deficiency in mismatch repair and its pathogenesis remains undefined. Diagnosis of these rare sebaceous lesions warrants the search for associated internal malignant diseases: the peculiarity of skin lesions and their biomolecular characterisation with microsatellite instability analysis and immunohistochemistry could be used to identify familial Muir-Torre syndrome, allowing clinicians to tailor a personalised programme to screen for skin and visceral malignant diseases in high-risk individuals."
21682876,"BACKGROUND: Kallmann syndrome (KS), comprised of congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH) and anosmia, is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorder. Its exact incidence is currently unknown, and a mutation in one of the identified KS genes has only been found in ~30% of the patients. METHODS: Herein, we investigated epidemiological, clinical, and genetic features of KS in Finland. RESULTS: The minimal incidence estimate of KS in Finland was 1:48 000, with clear difference between males (1:30 000) and females (1:125 000) (p = 0.02). The reproductive phenotype of 30 probands (25 men; 5 women) ranged from severe HH to partial puberty. Comprehensive mutation analysis of all 7 known KS genes (KAL1, FGFR1, FGF8, PROK2, PROKR2, CHD7, and WDR11) in these 30 well-phenotyped probands revealed mutations in KAL1 (3 men) and FGFR1 (all 5 women vs. 4/25 men), but not in other genes. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that Finnish KS men harbor mutations in gene(s) yet-to-be discovered with sex-dependent penetrance of the disease phenotype. In addition, some KS patients without CHD7 mutations display CHARGE-syndrome associated phenotypic features (e.g. ear or eye anomalies), possibly implying that, in addition to CHD7, there may be other genes associated with phenotypes ranging from KS to CHARGE."
23416623,"UNLABELLED: X-linked hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (XLHED) is characterised by hypohidrosis, sparse hair, and teeth abnormalities. Infants with XLHED have an increased risk of death by hyperpyrexia. XLHED is the most common form of hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (HED); however, no population-based prevalence estimates are available. We aimed to: 1) estimate the prevalence of XLHED in the Danish population per January 1, 2011; 2) identify the most frequent age at time of diagnosis; and 3) quantify the most frequent clinical feature associated with XLHED. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a nationwide cross-sectional study (1995-2010). We leveraged national medical registries and data from clinical departments to categorise XLHED cases into three groups: 1) Molecularly-confirmed XLHED; 2) Clinically-diagnosed HED (registered with ICD-10 Q 82.4); and 3) Possible HED (registered with sufficient clinical features based on a clinical algorithm that we designed). RESULTS: We identified 90 molecularly-confirmed XLHED, 146 clinically-diagnosed HED, and 988 possible HED cases between 1995 and 2010 (total n = 1224). The prevalence was 21.9 per 100,000 overall and 1.6 per 100,000 when restricting to molecularly-confirmed XLHED cases. The most frequent age at time of XLHED diagnosis occurred between the ages of 11 and 18 years. Teeth abnormalities occurred in 79% of all cases and 52% of molecularly-confirmed cases as a primary clinical marker. CONCLUSION: We present the first ever population-based prevalence estimates of XLHED and suggest that the prevalence of XLHED may be higher than previously estimated. Diagnosis occurs most frequently during adolescence and teeth abnormalities were the most frequent clinical marker of XLHED."
28983970,"This study aims to characterize the epidemiology of immunocompetent Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) diagnosed 2000-2013 in Sweden.Cases were identified in the population-based Swedish Lymphoma Register. Incidence per 100 000 person-years and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated, and PCNSL-specific survival was estimated using relative survival. Tests for temporal trends were performed using Poisson regression. Population incidence of all brain tumors was retrieved for comparison.With 359 identified PCNSL cases (median age 66 years), overall incidence was 0.26 (95% CI: 0.24-0.29) and the average annual increase 4% (P = .002). The increasing trend was primarily observed among elderly individuals (70+ years). Similarly, an increase in incidence of all brain tumors was noted only among the elderly. There was no significant improvement in relative survival across the study period although, among fit patients (with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, EGOC 0), survival plateaued 6 years after diagnosis.The increasing PCNSL incidence in the elderly was consistent with an increasing incidence of brain tumors of any type and may in part be attributable to improved diagnostics and reporting in this group. New treatment options have not yet translated into general survival improvements in a population-based setting, although the presence of long-term survivors among fit patients is encouraging."
8061578,"In the study of international childhood cancer incidence coordinated by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, carcinomas were generally rare, with an annual incidence for most sites nearly always under 1/1 million. Liver carcinoma was most common in parts of East Asia, Oceania, and Africa, where it is also common among adults and hepatitis B infection is widespread. Adrenocortical carcinoma had an incidence in Sao Paulo, Brazil, of 1.5/1 million, more than three times the rate in most other registries, indicating the presence of either a specific environmental risk factor acting before or around the time of birth or a concentration of genetically susceptible persons. Thyroid carcinoma seldom had a recorded incidence of more than 1/1 million, and variations in recorded rates may reflect differences in frequency of diagnosis rather than variations in risk. In East Asian populations, who have the highest incidence of nasopharyngeal carcinoma among adults, the childhood incidence of this cancer was moderately elevated. By far the highest incidence in children was found in North Africa, a region of intermediate risk for adults. In the United States the incidence among Black children was nine times that among Whites. Genetic and environmental factors may both be involved in the striking ethnic and geographical distribution. Oral carcinoma in childhood had a high relative frequency in Bangladesh. In the United States, the incidence among Black children was three times that among Whites. Skin carcinoma had an exceptionally high frequency in Tunisia, associated with the unusually high prevalence of xeroderma pigmentosum.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
7668903,"OBJECTIVES:To estimate the incidence of adult Still's disease (ASD) and to specify, if possible, associated factors. METHODS:A retrospective study of the populations of the Brittany and Loire regions in west France was made from 1 January 1982 to 31 December 1991. All internal medicine and rheumatology practitioners of these regions were consulted. RESULTS:Sixty-two (62) cases were reported (93% response). The disease incidence calculated over five years was 0.16 per 100,000 inhabitants in the study population. There was no sex bias (sex ratio 1.06 in ASD v 1.05 in the overall population. The mean age of the study population was 36 years, with two peaks of distribution at 15-25 and 36-45 years. A history of allergy was present in 23% of patients (n = 14). In two patients, it was possible to correlate an environmental allergen to exacerbation of ASD. CONCLUSION:The yearly incidence of ASD was estimated to be 0.16 per 100,000 inhabitants. However, it was not possible to incriminate any infectious, toxic, or genetic factors in exacerbation of the disease."
10820128,"Propionyl CoA carboxylase (PCC) is a mitochondrial, biotin-dependent enzyme involved in the catabolism of amino acids, odd-chain fatty acids, and other metabolites. PCC consists of two subunits, alpha and beta, encoded by the PCCA and PCCB genes, respectively. Inherited PCC deficiency due to mutations in either gene results in propionic acidemia (PA), an autosomal recessive disease. Surprisingly, PA is highly prevalent among Inuits in Greenland. We have analyzed reverse transcriptase-PCR products of the beta-subunit mRNA, to characterize the responsible mutation(s). A 3-bp insertion, 1540insCCC, was found in homozygous form in three patients and in compound heterozygous form in one patient. The resulting PCC has no measurable activity, and the mutant beta-subunit appears to be very unstable. To test the hypothesis that a common mutation is responsible for PA in the Greenlandic Inuit population, 310 anonymous DNA samples of Inuit origin were screened for 1540insCCC. We found a carrier frequency of 5%, which is very high compared with those of most other autosomal recessive diseases. Analysis of alleles of a very closely linked marker, D3S2453, revealed a high degree of linkage disequilibrium between one specific allele and 1540insCCC, suggesting that this mutation may be a founder mutation."
21555052,"Data regarding the epidemiology of callosal anomalies are contradictory. We performed a population-based retrospective survey to study the birth prevalence and clinical features of agenesis/hypoplasia of the corpus callosum and accompanying central nervous system and somatic abnormalities in southeastern Hungary between July 1, 1992 and June 30, 2006. Among 185,486 live births, 38 patients (26 boys and 12 girls) manifested agenesis/hypoplasia of the corpus callosum, corresponding to a prevalence of 2.05 per 10,000 live births (95% confidence interval, 1.4-2.7). Callosal anomalies were isolated in 18 patients, and were associated with other central nervous system malformations in five children. Both central nervous system and noncentral nervous system abnormalities were evident in seven patients, whereas callosal dysgenesis was accompanied only by somatic anomalies in eight children. Five of 18 patients with isolated agenesis/hypoplasia of the corpus callosum remained asymptomatic. Developmental delay, intellectual disability, or epilepsy occurred in all patients, except one, when callosal anomalies were combined with other brain or somatic abnormalities. Five patients with multiplex malformations died. Callosal anomalies form a clinically significant and relatively frequent group of central nervous system malformations."
19790134,"Wegener's granulomatosis (WG) is a systemic vasculitis of unknown etiology. The UK General Practice Research Database (GPRD) contains the complete primary care records of approximately 3.6 million people. There are no data on the incidence and prevalence of WG from primary care. The aim of the study was to estimate the incidence and prevalence of WG in the GPRD population.We identified all patients who had a first diagnosis of WG during 1990-2005, using Oxford Information System and Read codes. The diagnosis was verified by review of a randomly selected sample of 35 records that had identifying data removed. The annual incidence was calculated as the number of incident cases divided by the total person-years.A total of 295 patients (51.2% male) with a first diagnosis of WG were identified during 1990-2005. The median age was 59 years (interquartile range 47-70 years). The overall annual incidence of WG was 8.4 per million (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 7.5-9.4). The annual rate in women and men was 8.1 per million (95% CI 6.8-9.6), and 8.8 per million (95% CI 7.4-10.3), respectively. The incidence was stable throughout the study period. There was an increase in the annual prevalence from 28.8 per million in 1990 to 64.8 per million in 2005. The diagnosis was verified in 28 of 31 available case records.This is the first study of the incidence and prevalence of WG in a database from a primary care population. The results are similar to previous studies from secondary and tertiary care and suggest that these studies are representative of the general population. The increasing prevalence with a constant incidence suggests that survival is improving with modern treatment protocols."
9212179,"The study was undertaken to procure population-based prevalence data on the various types of Usher syndrome and other retinal dystrophy-hearing impairment associations. The medical files on 646 patients with a panretinal pigmentary dystrophy aged 20-49 years derived from the Danish Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) register were scrutinised. The data were supplemented by a prior investigation on hearing ability in a part of the study population. After exclusion of patients with possibly extrinsic causes of hearing impairments, 118 patients, including 89 cases of Usher syndrome were allocated to one of five clinically defined groups. We calculated the following prevalence rates: Usher syndrome type I: 1.5/100,000, Usher syndrome type II: 2.2/100,000, and Usher syndrome type III: 0.1/100,000 corresponding to a 2:3 ratio between Usher syndrome type I and II. The overall prevalence rate of Usher syndrome was estimated to 5/100,000 in the Danish population, devoid of genetic isolates. The material comprised 11 cases with retinal dystrophy, hearing impairment, and additional syndromic features. Finally, 18 subjects with various retinal dystrophy-hearing impairment associations without syndromic features were identified, corresponding to a prevalence rate of 0.8/100,000. This group had a significant overrepresentation of X-linked RP, including two persons harboring a mutation in the retinitis pigmentosa GTP-ase regulator (RPGR) gene."
23374165,"To review the descriptive epidemiological data on neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs) in Italy, identify the spectrum of mutations in the causative genes, and analyze possible genotype-phenotype relations.A cohort of NCL patients was recruited through CLNet, a nationwide network of child neurology units. Diagnosis was based on clinical and pathological criteria following ultrastructural investigation of peripheral tissues. Molecular confirmation was obtained during the diagnostic procedure or, when possible, retrospectively.One hundred eighty-three NCL patients from 156 families were recruited between 1966 and 2010; 124 of these patients (from 88 families) were tested for known NCL genes, with 9.7% of the patients in this sample having not a genetic diagnosis. Late infantile onset NCL (LINCL) accounted for 75.8% of molecularly confirmed cases, the most frequent form being secondary to mutations in CLN2 (23.5%). Juvenile onset NCL patients accounted for 17.7% of this cohort, a smaller proportion than found in other European countries. Gene mutations predicted severe protein alterations in 65.5% of the CLN2 and 78.6% of the CLN7 cases. An incidence rate of 0.98/100,000 live births was found in 69 NCL patients born between 1992 and 2004, predicting 5 new cases a year. Prevalence was 1.2/1,000,000.Descriptive epidemiology data indicate a lower incidence of NCLs in Italy as compared to other European countries. A relatively high number of private mutations affecting all NCL genes might explain the genetic heterogeneity. Specific gene mutations were associated with severe clinical courses in selected NCL forms only."
17019734,"Acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs) are infrequent, yet highly malignant neoplasms responsible for a large number of cancer-related deaths. The incidence has been near stable over the last years. It continuously shows 2 peaks in occurrence in early childhood and later adulthood. With an incidence of 3.7 per 100,000 persons and an age-dependent mortality of 2.7 to nearly 18 per 100,000 persons, there is a rising awareness in the Western world of AML's special attributes resulting from an ever-aging population. To objectively describe epidemiologic data on this patient population, recent publications were evaluated to make transparent the current trends and facts. A review of the literature is presented, reflecting highlights of current research with respect to AML etiology. To estimate outcome and discuss informed treatment decisions with AML patients of different age groups and different biologic risk categories, it is mandatory to consider that the outcome results reported in clinical trials were until now heavily biased toward younger patients, whereas the overall dismal prognosis documented in population-based studies most likely reflects the exclusion of older patients from aggressive treatment. The etiology for most cases of AML is unclear, but a growing knowledge concerning leukemogenenic agents within chemotherapy regimens for other malignancies is already available. This includes specific associations of the most frequent balanced translocations in AML, including the ""good-risk"" abnormalities comprised by the core binding factor leukemias (i.e., AML with the translocation (8;21) and inversion of chromosome 16, and acute promyelocytic leukemia with the translocation (15;17)). In contrast to these genetic alterations, epigenetic lesions, e.g., promoter silencing by hypermethylation of the p15/INK4b and other genes, are increasingly recognized as important in the pathogenesis of AML."
12654975,"This 10-year (1991 to 2000) prospective study of MG in the county of Osona (Barcelona, Spain) reveals an annual incidence rate of 21.27 cases per million inhabitants (95% CI 13.89 to 31.16). Incidence increased from 5.03 x 10(6) in the age group of 0 to 14 years to 14.68 x 10(6) in the age group of 15 to 64 years and to 63.38 x 10(6) in the older population. These results, the highest reported to date, may be explained by the population aging."
22030798,"OBJECTIVE: Determining the prevalence of infant birth defects and describing sociodemographic factors associated with the occurrence of these diseases in a tertiary hospital in the city of Cali in Colombia. METHODOLOGY: Data from the Valle Teaching Hospital's surveillance system was analysed, covering March 2004 to October 2008. The methodology proposed by the Collaborative Study of Congenital Malformations in Latin-America (ECLAMC) was followed for determining birth defect occurrence. Tables and graphs were constructed for describing the characteristics of the new-born, their parents and the resulting pregnancies. RESULTS: There were 32,995 births during the study period (4 years and 7 months); there was at least one birth defect in 735 of them, giving a 2.22 per 10,000 births prevalence. The major birth defects having the highest prevalence were polydactyly (22.1 per 10,000 births), clubfoot (17.6), hydrocephalus (16.4), neural tube defects (16.7), limb reduction defects (8.2), cleft lip or cleft palate (10.9), heart defects (14.6), hydronephrosis (11.5), gastroschisis (7.3), cyclopia (2.4) and sirenomelia (1.2), DISCUSSION: The prevalence of birth defects related to environmental factors such as hydrocephalus, limb reduction defects, clubfoot, hydronephrosis, gastroschisis, cyclopia and sirenomelia showed higher prevalence compared to those reported in the pertinent literature. Some hypotheses which could explain such increase are reported."
8786062,"Congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD) is a heterogeneous disease with autosomic recessive transmission. In an epidemiological study in four provinces of Veneto (region of 2 586 830 inhabitants in north-east Italy), the recorded incidence rate for the period 1979-1993 was 4.65 x 10(-5); the prevalence rate in the year 1993 was 6.8x10(-6). The incidence and the prevalence rates that we have obtained during the course of our investigation represent the first estimates for CMD in Europe and show that this myopathy is among the most frequent neuromuscular diseases with autosomic recessive transmission."
12693805,"This study assesses the incidence and prevalence of cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis (CFA) in a well-defined and stable Norwegian population of 250,000 inhabitants during a period of 15 years. We conducted a file survey of all patients (n = 376) aged 16 years or older with a clinician's diagnosis of pulmonary fibrosis (ICD 8: 517 and ICD 9: 515 and 516). Cases with a history of exposure to fibrogenic agents or with collagen vascular disease were excluded and the remaining 158 cases were defined as CFA. The average annual incidence of hospitalised CFA was 4.3 per 100,000. No change was observed in the annual incidence during the 15-year study period. The prevalence was 19.7 and 23.9 per 100,000 by 31.12. 1991 and by 31.12. 1998, respectively. The incidence increased considerably and significantly with age. No significant gender differences were observed. The lack of gender differences and the increase with age were also found when the diagnosis of CFA was exclusively based on cases with hospital file records of breathlessness, bilateral crackles and bilateral shadows on chest radiograph."
1733827,"Mutations causing Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) have a short survival. Therefore, birth and population prevalence are maintained by new mutations. The present inventory was made to estimate the birth and population prevalence rates of DMD in the Netherlands. Seven methods of case identification were used. Data on 496 definite, probable or possible DMD patients born since 1961, or alive on January 1, 1983, were obtained. Several methods gave an estimated ascertainment of more than 95%. The prevalence rate at birth of DMD was estimated at 23.7 x 10(-5) (1:4215) male live births (MLB) yearly. The prevalence rate in the male population on January 1, 1983 was 5.4 x 10(-5) (1:18496). About 1% of the males in this study may have autosomal recessive Duchenne-like muscular dystrophy. Until now there has been no convincing evidence for geographic differences in DMD prevalence at birth. A list of frequency studies of Duchenne muscular dystrophy is included. The DMD mutation rate calculated by the indirect method is 7.9 x 10(-5) genes per generation. However, this may well be an over-estimate, as this method does not account for germline mosaicism. Using a modified sex ratio method the proportion of sporadic DMD among all cases was estimated to be 0.106 (range 0-0.332). High frequency of germline mosaicism in DMD is a likely cause for the apparent lack of sporadic cases as found in previous studies, if mutation rates in male and female gametes are equal. Therefore, methods for estimating the proportion of new mutants in DMD should take germline mosaicism into account. The modified sex ratio method allows incorporation of data on germline mosaicism if available."
1511997,"Fifty-eight cases of hereditary nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia due to pyruvate kinase deficiency were collected from both laboratories that have performed the assay since 1972 and from attending physicians in the province of Quebec. Using the postal addresses of the probands, a prevalence map was constructed according to the administrative regions of the province of Quebec. The prevalence was found to be higher in eastern Quebec (1/81,838) than in western Quebec (1/139,086). Fifty probands were of French Canadian origin whereas the remaining 6 were recent immigrants."
16236889,"BACKGROUND: Birth prevalence and survival in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) in the Netherlands were last investigated > 30 years ago. However, since then the birth prevalence may have decreased because of genetic counseling and an increased number of newborns of non-European descent. Although survival of CF patients has increased worldwide, a significantly lower median age at death was recently reported in the Netherlands compared with data from the United States. OBJECTIVES: To analyze birth prevalence and survival in CF patients in the Netherlands, and to compare this survival data with US CF data. DESIGN: Survey of all CF patients living in the Netherlands, and analysis of Dutch CF mortality statistics using data from the Dutch central statistics office, Statistics Netherlands (Voorburg, the Netherlands), and a comparison with Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (Bethesda, MD) patient registry data. SETTING: All CF centers in the Netherlands and the United States. PARTICIPANTS: All CF patients treated in the Netherlands on January 1, 2001, and all persons who died of CF between 1974 and 2000, and an equivalent US population. MEASUREMENTS: Birth prevalence and birth cohort-specific survival. RESULTS: The overall birth prevalence of CF for 1974 to 1994 was 1 in 4,750 live births, which is a considerable decrease compared with 1961 to 1965 (1 in 3,600 live births). Estimated survival to 30 years increased from 6% in the 1950-to-1954 cohort, to 36% in the 1970-to-1973 cohort. Exact survival could be calculated from 1974 onwards. Survival to 15 years increased from 72% from the 1974-to-1979 cohort, to 91% in the 1985-to-1989 cohort. Survival in the United States in the 1980-to-1984 cohort was better compared to the Netherlands, but this difference has disappeared over subsequent cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: The actual birth prevalence of CF in the Netherlands is clearly lower than it was 30 years ago. Survival in CF has dramatically improved. The difference in survival between the Netherlands and the United States, as observed in the cohorts born > 20 years ago, has disappeared."
8909435,"OBJECTIVE:To survey the epidemiologic literature for evidence of an increasing prevalence of myasthenia gravis (MG) over time, and to explore the reasons for the increase. DATA SOURCES:We found population-based reports of the epidemiology of MG by searching bibliographic databases. We used MG, epidemiology, prevalence, incidence, and mortality as search terms. STUDY SELECTION:We included population-based studies that reported the number of cases and the time period from which rates were calculated. STATISTICAL METHODS:We performed a regression analysis of rates versus date of study, comparing the slopes of regression lines for prevalence, incidence, and mortality. We performed a second analysis grouping rates by decade of study and calculating a mean rate weighted by the size of the population studied. We calculated 95% confidence intervals for each rate. RESULTS:We included 33 studies from 1950 through 1995. Prevalence and incidence rates increased over time, but the regression line for prevalence significantly exceeded that for incidence. Mortality rates declined slightly. The weighted means for prevalence rose significantly, but there was no significant change in incidence or mortality. CONCLUSION:The prevalence of MG has increased over the past forty-five years, probably because patients with the disease have longer life spans owing to present-day treatment."
15535817,"Congenital heart defects are the most common type of birth defect and contribute the most to infant mortality due to birth defects. This study examined the relationship between several demographic factors and selected congenital heart defects among the unique multiethnic population in Hawaii during 1986-99, using data from a population-based birth defects registry. Rates were significantly higher in 1993-99 than in 1986-92 for transposition of the great arteries and Ebstein's anomaly, and significantly lower for tetralogy of Fallot. Significantly elevated rates were found with maternal age of > or =35 years for ventricular septal defect, atrial septal defect, endocardial cushion defect, and hypoplastic left heart syndrome. When cases with a known chromosomal abnormality were excluded, elevated rates among the older maternal age group remained for ventricular septal defect, atrial septal defect, and hypoplastic left heart syndrome. Whites had significantly higher rates than one or more of the other racial/ethnic groups for Ebstein's anomaly and coarctation of aorta, and significantly lower rates for tetralogy of Fallot, atrial septal defect, pulmonary valve atresia/stenosis, tricuspid valve atresia/stenosis, and anomalous pulmonary venous return. Significantly higher rates were found among males for transposition of great arteries, aortic valve stenosis, and interrupted aortic arch and, among females, for ventricular septal defect, endocardial cushion defect, and anomalous pulmonary venous return. Some of these differences were consistent with the literature while others were not."
19812117,"Demyelinating acute transverse myelitis may be the first presentation of multiple sclerosis or remain a clinically isolated syndrome. North Canterbury, New Zealand provides a well circumscribed population to study acute transverse myelitis.to identify prognostic features, clinical outcomes and incidence of ATM in North Canterbury, New Zealand. All patients with acute transverse myelitis as a first neurological presentation diagnosed from January 2001 to December 2005 at a single institution providing all neurological care for North Canterbury were assessed for clinical data, MRI findings, cerebrospinal fluid results and clinical outcomes. CHAMPS, Barkhof/Tintore and Swanton criteria were applied to brain MRI. Sixty-one patients were identified with a mean duration of follow-up of 30 +/- 17 months. Fifty percent of patients with ATM with brain lesions by CHAMPS criteria converted to clinically definite multiple sclerosis. No patients with idiopathic acute transverse myelitis converted to clinically definite multiple sclerosis. There was a strong association with conversion to clinically definite multiple sclerosis and abnormal brain MRI by CHAMPS criteria (hazard ratio, 5.63; 1.83-17.3), Barkhof/Tintore criteria (hazard ratio, 6.43; 2.31-17.9) and Swanton criteria (hazard ratio, 4.53; 1.67-12.3). The age standardized annual incidence of acute transverse myelitis was 24.6 (18.2-31.1) per million, of definite and possible idiopathic acute transverse myelitis was 6.2 (2.9-9.6) per million, and of acute transverse myelitis with brain lesions was 4.7 (1.9-7.6) per million. Patients with idiopathic acute transverse myelitis are at low risk for conversion to clinically definite multiple sclerosis. Abnormal brain MRI by CHAMPS criteria is a sensitive predictor of conversion to clinically definite multiple sclerosis. The annual incidence of acute transverse multiple sclerosis in North Canterbury, New Zealand is significantly higher than previously reported."
19797309,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the incidence of and survival rates for WG, microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), Churg-Strauss syndrome (CSS) and PAN within a defined population in southern Sweden. METHODS: Cases were retrieved using hospital records and a serology database. All new cases of WG, MPA, CSS and PAN between 1997 and 2006 were included, provided they met pre-defined criteria, and were followed until 30 June 2008. The study area comprised two health care districts with a total population of 641 000. The standardized mortality ratio (SMR) was estimated using Swedish population data as a reference. RESULTS: A total of 140 (WG, 63; MPA 65; CSS 6; and PAN 6) cases (52% women) with a median age of 67.6 (range 20-96) years fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The annual incidence per million of the population (95% CI) was estimated to be 9.8 (7.4-12.2) for WG, 10.1 (7.7-12.6) for MPA and 0.9 (0-1.7) for both CSS and PAN. The highest incidence was found in patients aged >or=75 years (79.1/million). The 1- and 5-year survival rates were 87.8 and 71.6% for all patients, but lower for MPA (80 and 55%) compared with WG (95 and 83%; P = 0.001), although the difference was not significant in the multivariate analysis. The SMR was 2.77 (95% CI 2.02, 3.71) for all patients. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of WG and MPA was equal in our district, but there was a difference in survival rates related to age and renal function. A progressive increase in age-specific incidence rates was observed."
19828294,"To compare the incidence of West syndrome (WS) and early infantile epileptic encephalopathy (EIEE) in Miyagi Prefecture, Japan, we studied retrospectively the medical records of cases involving WS or EIEE for the period 2000-2005. During this period, 45 children developed WS and one child was diagnosed with EIEE. The estimated incidence rates of WS and EIEE were 4.2 per 10,000 live births (95% CI, 3.0-5.5) and 0.1 per 10,000 live births (95% CI, 0-0.3), respectively. The occurrence of EIEE was one-fortieth that of WS."
15127977,"Almost no epidemiological data are available on a worldwide basis on the prevalence, incidence or relative frequency of interstitial lung diseases (ILD). We report the results of a registration of ILD by 23 centers of pulmonary medicine in Spain over one year (from October 2000 to September 2001).A standardized questionnaire was sent to the centers, together with guidelines for classification and diagnostic evaluation. This questionnaire included questions about the explorations performed to establish the diagnosis.A total of 511 cases were registered. The mean age of the patients was 61 +/- 0.7 (x +/- SEM) yrs. The male to female ratio was 1.2:1. The estimated incidence of ILD was 7.6 per 100,000/year. The most frequent disease was idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (38.6%), followed in decreasing order by sarcoidosis (14.9%), cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (10.4%), ILD associated with collagen vascular diseases (9.9%) and hypersensitivity pneumonitis (6.6%). In 5.1% of cases ILD was unclassified. HRCT scan was performed in 91.9% of cases, bronchoalveolar lavage in 67.9%, transbronchial lung biopsy in 59.9%, and surgical lung biopsy in 22.7%.This registration provides interesting information on the occurrence of ILD in Spain and on the procedures used to establish the diagnosis."
14872101,"OBJECTIVES: We aimed to obtain an estimate of the prevalence and demographics of systemic sclerosis (SSc) and its subtypes at the turn of the millennium. METHODS: Case finding from multiple sources from a defined geographical area. Diagnosis confirmed by clinical examination. RESULTS: The crude prevalence of SSc in northeast England was 8.8 (95% CI: 6.8-10.8) per 100,000. The prevalence when adjusted for the entire UK is 8.2 (95% CI: 6.2-9.8) per 100,000. The ratio of women to men was 5.2:1. The median age of patients was 57.1 yr. The ratio of limited cutaneous SSc to diffuse cutaneous SSc was 4.7:1. Limited cutaneous SSc is associated with the presence of anticentromere antibodies; diffuse cutaneous SSc is associated with anti-Scl 70 antibodies, but either antibody was found in either form of SSc. CONCLUSIONS: SSc appears to be more common in northeast England than was found in the West Midlands in 1986. This may reflect changes in the diagnostic definition of SSc."
30260188,"INTRODUCTION:Takayasu's arteritis (TA) is a rare and potentially life-threatening granulomatous large-vessel vasculitis that involves mostly in the aorta and its proximal branches, and occurs most commonly in young females. This study measures the incidence and prevalence of TA, and assesses the gender distribution and territorial differences in the occurrences of this disease in Poland over a five-year period. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first evaluation of this rare disease in Poland based on a hospital morbidity database. MATERIAL AND METHODS:Analyses were performed with population-based administrative data obtained from a national hospital morbidity study carried out between January 2011 - December 2015 by the Polish National Institute of Public Health. Yearly incidence rates and prevalence of TA were calculated using the number of TA patients and corresponding census data for the overall Polish population. RESULTS:Data included 660 hospitalization records. The final study sample comprised 177 patients: 154 female (87%) and 23 male (13%) with first-time hospitalization for TA. The mean age was 45.4years (95% CI: 42.9-47.8; SD 16.8; range 4-81 years), median 47. The incidence rate of TA was estimated at 0.92 per million per year (95% CI: 0.68-1.16). Five-year TA prevalence was estimated to be 4,6 per million. Incidence rates of TA did not vary significantly between more urban and more rural regions. CONCLUSIONS:The incidence of TA in Poland was similar or lower to data reported by other European countries. The study provides epidemiological data on TA in Poland that may be useful while comparing it with other geographical regions."
20415912,"BACKGROUND: Van der Woude syndrome (VWS) is the most common clefting syndrome in humans. It is characterized by the association of congenital lower lip fistulae with cleft lip and/or cleft palate. VWS individuals have a high prevalence of hypodontia. Although caused by a single gene mutation, VWS has variable phenotypic expression. This study aimed to describe the range of clinical presentations in 22 individuals with VWS to facilitate its diagnosis. METHODS: A retrospective study of 22 patients with a diagnosis of VWS was undertaken at the Australian Craniofacial Unit (ACFU) in Adelaide. Three extended families with affected members were included in the study cohort. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of lip pits in this study cohort was 86%. Cleft phenotypes included bilateral cleft lip and palate (32%); unilateral cleft lip and palate (32%); submucous cleft palate (23%); and isolated cleft hard and soft palate (9%). Missing permanent teeth were reported in 86% of affected individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Submucous cleft palate in VWS may go undiagnosed if the lower lip pits are not detected. Associated hypodontia and resultant malocclusions will also require management by a dental team."
9279616,"OBJECTIVE:To describe the incidence and prevalence of primary biliary cirrhosis in an urban population between 1987 and 1994, using stringent inclusion criteria and a well-defined study area and population. DESIGN:Descriptive study based on a case register compiled by a retrospective and prospective case-finding exercise and examination of case notes. SETTING:The city of Newcastle upon Tyne. MAIN INCLUSION CRITERIA: (1) Definite cases: fulfilling all three of the following diagnostic criteria: positive antimitochondrial antibody (AMA) > or = 1:40; cholestatic liver function tests (LFT); diagnostic or compatible liver histology. (2) Probable cases: fulfilling two of these criteria. SUBJECTS:All cases of primary biliary cirrhosis identified by multiple case-finding methods, alive from 1 January 1987 to 31 December 1994, in the defined area. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS:Incidence and point prevalence rates by age and sex. RESULTS:In all, 202 potential cases were identified, of whom 160 met at least two inclusion criteria. In definite cases annual incidence varied from 14 to 32 (mean 22) per million whole population (with no clear trend) and point prevalence rose from 180 per million in 1987 to 240 in 1994. Mean age at diagnosis in cases incident during the study period was 63.2 years (S.D. 11.1 years, range 39.8-85.7 years). CONCLUSIONS:Primary biliary cirrhosis is much more common in Newcastle than has previously been reported anywhere in the world, and prevalence appears to be rising."
961413,"A prevalence investigation of Cornelia de Lange's syndrome in Denmark is presented. The patients were traced by screening all institutional mentally retarded patients, patients in schools and kindergartens for imbecile patients and finally by getting information on Cornelia de Lange patients known to pediatric departments. In this way 24 patients, 10 men and 14 women, were found. This amounts to a population prevalence of 0.5/100 000. Clinical data, histories of the patients and genealogical data are presented by means of tables. The eldest patient was 49 years old, but 75% of the patients were younger than 20 years. Two of the probands were sibs. Another 2 sibs were registered as mentally retarded without specific syndromes. One case of consanguinity among parents was found. The mode of ascertainment is discussed and it is concluded that the present investigation presents a minimum prevalence figure. Four patients are presented who for various reasons were not available during the prevalence investigation proper. A prevalence figure of 0.6/100 000 is found if these 4 patients are included in the calculations. One of the last mentioned patients represented a familial case. The patient in question was a girl with a younger half-brother, the mother in common, both children being very typical cases of Cornella de Lange's syndrome."
21166788,"A large scale genetic and epidemiological study of Huntington's disease (HD) was carried out in Greece from January 1995 to December 2008. Diagnostic testing was carried out in 461 symptomatic individuals, while 256 were tested for presymptomatic purposes. The diagnosis of HD with a CAG expansion ≥ 36 was confirmed in 278 symptomatic individuals. The prevalence of HD in Greece was estimated at approximately 2.5 to 5.4:100,000, while the mean minimum incidence was estimated at 2.2 to 4.4 per million per year. The molecular diagnosis of HD was confirmed in the majority of patients (84.4%) sent for confirmation. The false-positive cases 15.6% were characterized by the absence of a family history of HD and the presence of an atypical clinical picture. The uptake of predictive testing for HD was 8.6%. A prenatal test was requested in six pregnancies. The findings of our study do not differ significantly from those of similar studies from other European countries despite the relative genetic isolation of Greece. Of interest is the identification of clusters of HD in Greece. The presence or absence of a family history of HD should be interpreted cautiously, during the diagnostic process."
17127017,"The prevalence and characteristics of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and partial fetal alcohol syndrome (PFAS) were determined in a third primary school cohort in a community in South Africa (SA).An active case ascertainment, two-tier screening methodology, and the revised Institute of Medicine diagnostic criteria were employed among 818 first grade pupils. Characteristics of children with FAS and PFAS are contrasted with a randomly selected control group. Data were collected and analyzed for children in the study regarding: (1) physical growth and development, including dysmorphology, (2) intelligence and behavioral characteristics, and (3) their mother's social, behavioral, and physical characteristics.The rate of FAS and PFAS in this area continues as the highest reported in any overall community and is much higher than rates elsewhere. In this cohort it is 68.0-89.2 per 1000. Severe episodic drinking on weekends among mothers of children with FAS and PFAS accounts for 96% of all alcohol consumed. Various measures of maternal drinking are significantly correlated with negative outcomes of children in the areas of non-verbal intelligence (-0.26), verbal intelligence (-0.28), problem behavior (0.31), and overall dysmorphology score (0.59). Significantly more FAS and PFAS exists among children of rural residents (OR=3.79).A high rate of FAS and PFAS was again documented in this community, and it has increased. Given population similarities, we suspect that other communities in the Western Cape Province of South Africa also have high rates. Programs for prevention are needed."
19103861,"BACKGROUND: A neonatal haemoglobinopathy screening programme was implemented in Brussels more than a decade ago and in Liège 5 years ago; the programme was adapted to the local situation. METHODS: Neonatal screening for haemoglobinopathies was universal, performed using liquid cord blood and an isoelectric focusing technique. All samples with abnormalities underwent confirmatory testing. Major and minor haemoglobinopathies were reported. Affected children were referred to a specialist centre. A central database in which all screening results were stored was available and accessible to local care workers. A central clinical database to monitor follow-up is under construction. RESULTS: A total of 191,783 newborns were screened. One hundred and twenty-three (1:1559) newborns were diagnosed with sickle cell disease, seven (1:27,398) with beta thalassaemia major, five (1:38,357) with haemoglobin H disease, and seven (1:27,398) with haemoglobin C disease. All major haemoglobinopathies were confirmed, and follow-up of the infants was undertaken except for three infants who did not attend the first medical consultation despite all efforts. CONCLUSIONS: The universal neonatal screening programme was effective because no case of major haemoglobinopathy was identified after the neonatal period. The affected children received dedicated medical care from birth. The screening programme, and specifically the reporting of minor haemoglobinopathies, has been an excellent health education tool in Belgium for more than 12 years."
22893477,"Mortality among males with 47,XYY is increased due to a host of conditions and diseases. Clinical studies have suggested a poorer educational level and social adaptation among 47,XYY persons. We wanted to study the socio-economic profile in 47,XYY persons and the impact on mortality. We conducted a register study using several Danish nationwide registries. 206 47,XYY men and 20,078 controls from the background population and 1,049 controls with Klinefelter syndrome were included. Information concerning marital status, fatherhood, education, income, and retirement were obtained. Compared to the background population, 47,XYY men had fewer partnerships, were less likely to become fathers, had lower income and educational level, and retired at an earlier age. The mortality among 47,XYY men was significantly increased with a hazard ratio (HR) of 3.6 (95% confidence interval: 2.6-5.1). Adjusting for marital and educational status reduced this HR to 2.7. Compared to Klinefelter syndrome, 47,XYY had significantly fewer partnerships, were more likely to become fathers, but had lower income. Mortality among 47,XYY men was increased compared with Klinefelter syndrome with a HR of 1.36. The results show a severely inferior outcome in all investigated socio-economic parameters compared to the background population and an affected profile compared with Klinefelter syndrome, even though the population in Denmark has equal and free access to health care and education. We conclude that 47,XYY is often associated with a poorer socio-economic profile, which partly explains the increased mortality."
10192448,"Diamond-Blackfan anaemia (DBA) is a congenital disease characterized by defective erythroid progenitor maturation: 30% of patients have congenital malformations. The link between these malformations and defective erythropoiesis is unclear: a defect in a molecule acting both on embryo development and haemopoiesis has been proposed. Inheritance is autosomal dominant in most familial cases, but recessive families have also been reported. Many cases are sporadic. A DBA locus has been mapped on chromosome 19q13.2 (Gustavsson et al, 1997), but several families unlinked to this locus have also been reported (Gustavsson et al, 1998). This paper presents clinical, epidemiological and molecular data for DBA in the Italian population. Segregation analysis of 19q markers in patients with DBA showed exclusion of this locus in 5/12 families with inherited DBA. There was evidently locus heterogeneity for DBA in this population. A new microdeletion was identified in one patient. Other families, in which DBA segregates concordantly with the 19q critical region, suggest incomplete penetrance and expressivity of the DBA gene."
15057820,"Stevens-Johnson syndrome and the related disease toxic epidermal necrolysis are life-threatening reactions of the skin to particular types of medication. Here we show that there is a strong association in Han Chinese between a genetic marker, the human leukocyte antigen HLA-B*1502, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome induced by carbamazepine, a drug commonly prescribed for the treatment of seizures. It should be possible to exploit this association in a highly reliable test to predict severe adverse reaction, as well as for investigation of the pathogenesis of Stevens-Johnson syndrome."
21757957,"BACKGROUND: The recent literature suggests that the incidence and prevalence of myasthenia gravis (MG) are changing. We performed a population-based study of MG in the province of Trentino (524,826 inhabitants) and compared the results with those collected 20 years ago. METHODS: Multiple sources of information (discharge diagnosis, antibody tests and anticholinesterase drugs) were analyzed. Incidence was calculated from 2005 to 2009. Prevalence was calculated on December 31, 2009. Comparison was made with descriptive statistics for 1981-1990 for the identical region. RESULTS: Incidence and prevalence greatly increased in comparison with 1981-1990 data. The prevalence rate increased from 82.9 (95% confidence interval, CI, 58.4-114.3) in 1990 to 129.6 (95% CI 100.6-164.3) per million population, whereas the average annual incidence increased from 7.4 (95% CI 5-10.4) per million person-years in 1981-1990 to 14.8 (95% CI 10.5-20.3) in 2005-2009. This increase was mainly due to male patients with late-onset MG. CONCLUSIONS: The study confirms the increase in incidence and prevalence of late-onset MG in the same region 20 years apart. So we should consider MG also as a disease of the elderly."
19804849,"Fragile X syndrome (FXS) results from a CGG-repeat expansion that triggers hypermethylation and silencing of the FMR1 gene. FXS is referred to as the most common form of inherited intellectual disability, yet its true incidence has never been measured directly by large population screening. Here, we developed an inexpensive and high-throughput assay to quantitatively assess FMR1 methylation in DNA isolated from the dried blood spots of 36,124 deidentified newborn males. This assay displays 100% specificity and 100% sensitivity for detecting FMR1 methylation, successfully distinguishing normal males from males with full-mutation FXS. Furthermore, the assay can detect excess FMR1 methylation in 82% of females with full mutations, although the methylation did not correlate with intellectual disability. With amelogenin PCR used for detecting the presence of a Y chromosome, this assay can also detect males with Klinefelter syndrome (KS) (47, XXY). We identified 64 males with FMR1 methylation and, after confirmatory testing, found seven to have full-mutation FXS and 57 to have KS. Because the precise incidence of KS is known, we used our observed KS incidence as a sentinel to assess ascertainment quality and showed that our KS incidence of 1 in 633 newborn males was not significantly different from the literature incidence of 1 in 576 (p = 0.79). The seven FXS males revealed an FXS incidence in males of 1 in 5161 (95% confidence interval of 1 in 10,653-1 in 2500), consistent with some earlier indirect estimates. Given the trials now underway for possible FXS treatments, this method could be used in newborn or infant screening as a way of ensuring early interventions for FXS."
24322455,"The aim of this study was to estimate the nationwide prevalence and incidence of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in South Korea. National Health Insurance claims data covering almost all Koreans (~50 million) during 2006-2010 were analyzed. Individuals with SLE were identified if (1) they had experienced at least one hospitalization for SLE (International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision code M32), (2) they had taken at least one concomitant prescription of immunosuppressant and hydroxychloroquine, or (3) they had taken anti-dsDNA antibody (≥2) or complement tests (≥2) during each calendar year. Incident cases were defined only if they had not been SLE prevalent for the preceding 2 years and had been SLE prevalent for 2 years consecutively thereafter. The annual prevalence (per 100,000) increased slightly from 20.6 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 20.2-21.0] in 2006 to 26.5 (95% CI 26.0-27.0) in 2010, and the incidence (per 100,000) ranged between 2.5 (95% CI 2.4-2.6) in 2008 and 2.8 (95% CI 2.7-2.9) in 2009. The number of SLE-prevalent female patients outnumbered SLE-prevalent male patients by approximately sixfold, with a female-to-male incidence ratio of ~9:1. The prevalence and incidence of SLE increased significantly with age, regardless of sex, to a peak the age of 30-39 years. However, while both of them significantly decreased thereafter in females, this tendency was not observed in males."
17277405,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence of sarcoidosis in Iceland, its clinical manifestations and potential environmental influences. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All histopathological diagnoses of non-necrotizing granulomas generated in Iceland during the period 1981-2003 were reviewed with respect to a diagnosis of sarcoidosis. Further, patients were identified by searching hospital discharge diagnoses at the University Hospital in Reykjavik and the Regional Hospital in Northern Iceland. Only histologically verified cases were included. RESULTS: A total of 235 patients were found with histopathologically proven sarcoidosis. Limited to patients verified by tissue diagnosis, the annual incidence of sarcoidosis is 3,84/100.000/year. The incidence was found to be 2,8/100,000/year during the first half of the investigation period and 5,0/100,000/year during the second. This rate is lower than in other Nordic countries. There were 122 women and 113 men. The mean age at diagnosis was 50,8 years for women and 47,5 for men. The mean age at diagnosis was higher in Iceland than elsewhere. Clinically, respiratory symptoms predominated. Ocular symptoms and erythema nodosum are rare, and life-threatening cardiovascular and neurological manifestations are distinctly unusual. CONCLUSION: The low incidence is undoubtedly due to the strict inclusion criteria in the present study, i.e. only those with a tissue diagnosis were included. We have no explanation as to the higher age at diagnosis in Iceland than elsewhere. Registration of possible environmental factors and clinical evaluation may be improved."
16053904,"The study was performed to evaluate the prevalence of prenatal ultrasound diagnoses for renal anomalies in 20 registries of 12 European countries, and to compare the different prenatal scanning policies. Standardized data were acquired from 709,030 livebirths, stillbirths, and induced abortions during the study period of 2.5 years and transmitted for central analysis. At least one renal malformation was diagnosed in 1130 infants and fetuses. Prenatal diagnosis (PD) was given in 81.8% of all cases, 29% of these pregnancies were terminated. The highest detection rate was reported for unilateral multicystic dysplastic kidneys with 97% (102/105). An early diagnosis was documented for exstrophy of bladder at a mean gestational age of 18.5 weeks. Dilatations of the upper urinary tract were seen late in pregnancy at 28.3 weeks. Terminations of pregnancies (TOP) were performed in 67% (58/86) of the detected bilateral renal agenesis/dysgenesis, but only 4% of the unilateral multicystic dysplastic renal malformations (4/102). In about 1/3 of the cases, renal malformations are within the category of associated malformations, which include multiple non-syndromal malformations, chromosomal aberrations, and non-chromosomal syndromes. Renal malformations were detected in 2/3 of the associated category by the first prenatal ultrasound scan. Detection rates vary in the different countries of the European community due to diverse policies, ethical, and religious background. Countries with no routine ultrasound show the lowest rates in detection, and termination of pregnancy. Prenatally detected renal malformations should result in a careful examination for further anomalies. Prenatal ultrasound fulfills the needs of screening examinations and is a good tool in detecting lethal and severe renal malformations."
22537432,"Most cases of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are associated with cirrhosis related to chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Changes in the time trends of HCC and most variations in its age-, sex-, and race-specific rates among different regions are likely to be related to differences in hepatitis viruses that are most prevalent in a population, the timing of their spread, and the ages of the individuals the viruses infect. Environmental, host genetic, and viral factors can affect the risk of HCC in individuals with HBV or HCV infection. This review summarizes the risk factors for HCC among HBV- or HCV-infected individuals, based on findings from epidemiologic studies and meta-analyses, as well as determinants of patient outcome and the HCC disease burden, globally and in the United States."
22362843,"A pulmonary hypertension (PH) registry (Spanish Registry of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension) was undertaken to analyse prevalence, incidence and survival of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) in Spain, and to assess the applicability of recent survival prediction equations. Voluntary reporting of previously diagnosed and incident PAH or CTEPH cases (July 2007-June 2008) was performed. Demographic, functional and haemodynamic variables were evaluated. 866 patients with PAH and 162 with CTEPH were included. PAH associated with toxic oil syndrome and pulmonary veno-occlusive disease were reported for the first time in a PAH registry. Estimated prevalences were as follows: PAH, 16 and CTEPH, 3.2 cases per million adult inhabitants (MAI). Estimated incidences were as follows: PAH, 3.7 and CTEPH, 0.9 cases per MAI per yr. 1-, 3- and 5-yr survival was 87%, 75% and 65%, respectively, with no differences between PAH and CTEPH. Male sex, right atrial pressure and cardiac index were independent predictors of death. Matching between observed survival and that predicted by different equations was closer when the characteristics of the cohorts were similar. Epidemiology and survival of PAH patients in the Spanish registry are similar to recent registries. Characteristics of the population from which survival prediction equations are derived influence their applicability to a different cohort. CTEPH is much less prevalent than PAH, although has a similar survival rate."
12872837,"Since the addition of tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) to the North Carolina Newborn Screening Program, 20 infants with two consecutive elevated 3-hydroxyisovalerylcarnitine (C5OH) levels have been evaluated for evidence of inborn errors of metabolism associated with this metabolite. Ten of these 20 infants had significant concentrations of both 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid and 3-methylcrotonylglycine in their urine, suggestive of 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase (3-MCC) deficiency. Four of these 10 were infants whose abnormal metabolites were found to be of maternal origin. Of 8 patients with probable 3-MCC deficiency, 7 have been tested and found to have the enzyme deficiency confirmed in lymphoblasts or cultured fibroblasts; one of these 7 infants had only marginally decreased 3-MCC activity in lymphocytes but deficient 3-MCC in fibroblasts. We estimate the incidence of 3-MCC deficiency at 1:64000 live births in North Carolina. We conclude that MS/MS newborn screening will detect additional inborn errors of metabolism, such as 3-MCC deficiency, not traditionally associated with newborn screening. The evaluation of newborns with two abnormally elevated C5OH levels on MS/MS newborn screening should include, at least, urine organic acid analysis by capillary GC-MS and a plasma acylcarnitine profile by MS/MS. Long-term follow-up is needed to determine the outcome of presymptomatically diagnosed patients with 3-MCC deficiency by MS/MS newborn screening."
17266063,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the epidemiology and clinical course of Behçet's disease (BD) over a 17-year period in a defined area of northern Italy. METHODS: All patients with incident BD diagnosed over a 17-year period (from January 1, 1988 to December 31, 2004) living in the Reggio Emilia area were identified through the following sources: physicians at Reggio Emilia Hospital, medical practitioners, and community-based specialists. We identified all patients registered in a centralized index and in the Reggio Emilia district database for rare diseases. Patients were followed up from the time of diagnosis until either their death or April 1, 2005. RESULTS: Eighteen patients (9 men and 9 women) had complete BD. Mean +/- SD age at diagnosis was 33 +/- 7 years. The incidence rate of BD was 0.24 per 100,000. The prevalence of BD on January 1, 2005 was 3.8 per 100,000. No patients died during the followup period. Although all patients developed oral ulceration during the disease course, 22.2% had no oral lesions at disease onset. Eye disease occurred in 55.6%. Ocular disease was more common in men and appeared at disease onset or within the first few years of disease onset (median 3 years). Only 1 patient had loss of useful vision in at least 1 eye at the end of followup. In all affected patients, visual acuity improved once treatment was started. CONCLUSION: This population-based study is the first to report the prevalence and incidence of BD in Italy. In Italian patients, BD is nonfatal and the prognosis of eye disease is good."
25944380,"Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a rare hereditary bone fragility disorder, caused by collagen I mutations in 90% of cases. There are no comprehensive genotype-phenotype studies on >100 families outside North America, and no population-based studies determining the genetic epidemiology of OI. Here, detailed clinical phenotypes were recorded, and the COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes were analyzed in 164 Swedish OI families (223 individuals). Averages for bone mineral density (BMD), height and yearly fracture rate were calculated and related to OI and mutation type. N-terminal helical mutations in both the α1- and α2-chains were associated with the absence of dentinogenesis imperfecta (P<0.0001 vs 0.0049), while only those in the α1-chain were associated with blue sclera (P=0.0110). Comparing glycine with serine substitutions, α1-alterations were associated with more severe phenotype (P=0.0031). Individuals with type I OI caused by qualitative vs quantitative mutations were shorter (P<0.0001), but did not differ considering fractures or BMD. The children in this cohort were estimated to represent >95% of the complete Swedish pediatric OI population. The prevalence of OI types I, III, and IV was 5.16, 0.89, and 1.35/100 000, respectively (7.40/100 000 overall), corresponding to what has been estimated but not unequivocally proven in any population. Collagen I mutation analysis was performed in the family of 97% of known cases, with causative mutations found in 87%. Qualitative mutations caused 32% of OI type I. The data reported here may be helpful to predict phenotype, and describes for the first time the genetic epidemiology in >95% of an entire OI population."
15834040,"Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leucoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is caused by mutations of the Notch3 gene on 19p13. Varying phenotypic expression leads to under recognition and misdiagnosis. Prevalence therefore remains uncertain. We sought to estimate the prevalence of CADASIL in the west of Scotland.A register for CADASIL was established at a regional neurosciences centre in 2002. All patients with genetically (exons 3, 4, 5, and 6) or histologically confirmed CADASIL residing in two defined administrative health areas were identified. Pedigree members at varying risk of carrying the mutation were also identified and the number of probable Notch3 mutation carriers in the defined population was predicted. Prevalence was calculated for definite CADASIL cases, with and without probable carrier numbers, based upon adult population figures from the 2002 national census.Twenty two individuals from seven pedigrees with confirmed CADASIL and resident in the defined geographical area were identified, yielding a prevalence of 1.98 (95% confidence interval 1.24-3.00) per 100 000 adults. An additional 37 individuals were predicted to be carriers of the Notch3 mutation, yielding a probable mutation prevalence of 4.14 (3.04-5.53) per 100,000 adults.The prevalence of genetically proven CADASIL was 1.98 per 100,000 adults in the defined population. This figure underestimates disease burden."
10693883,"To describe the epidemiology of the primary systemic vasculitides (PSV; Wegener's granulomatosis, Churg-Strauss syndrome, microscopic polyangiitis, polyarteritis nodosa) in a well-defined population over a 10-year period.An inception cohort of patients from the Norwich Health Authority (NHA) who were >15 years of age and had PSV first diagnosed between January 1, 1988 and December 31, 1997 was collected. Incidence rates were adjusted for age and sex to the 1992 population. The prevalence of PSV in this cohort was estimated on December 31, 1997. Patients were classified according to the American College of Rheumatology 1990 vasculitis criteria and the Chapel Hill Consensus definitions.Eighty-two NHA residents fulfilled the inclusion criteria. There were 47 men and 35 women, with a mean age of 62.9 years (median 65.0 years). The overall annual incidence of PSV among NHA residents was 19.8/million (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 15.8-24.6). The point prevalence on December 31, 1997 was 144.5/million (95% CI 110.4-185.3). PSV was more common in males (23.5/million; 95% CI 17.3-31.3) than females (16.4/million; 95% CI 11.4-22.8). The age- and sex-specific incidence showed a clear increase with age, with an overall peak in the 65-74 year age group (60.1/million).In our study population, the annual incidence of PSV is slowly increasing with time and the incidence is greatest in the elderly."
15468153,"Ectodermal dysplasias are a large group of heritable conditions characterized by congenital defects of one or more ectodermal structures and their appendages: hair (hypotrichosis, partial, or total alopecia), nails (dystrophic, hypertrophic, abnormally keratinized), teeth (enamel defect or absent), and sweat glands (hypoplastic or aplastic). The ectodermal dysplasias, as a rule, are not pure ""one-layer diseases."" Mesodermal and, rarely, endodermal dysplasias coexist. Embryogenesis exhibits distinct tissue organizational fields and specific interactions among the germ layers that may lead to a wide range of ectodermal dysplasias when genes important for development are mutated or otherwise altered in expression. Of the approximately 200 different ectodermal dysplasias, about 30 have been studied at the molecular level with identification of the causative gene. Freire-Maia and Pinheiro used the clinical aspects for their classification, and Priolo integrated molecular genetic and clinical aspects for her scheme. Those two more historical classification schemes have the difficulty that, when applied strictly, several additional groups of diseases should be integrated within the term ""ectodermal dysplasias,"" e.g. keratodermas with skin or hair alterations or the ichthyoses with associated features. Such consequent classification would lead to an endless list of diseases and would be useless for the practical work. Recent evidence implicates a genetic defect in different pathways orchestrating ectodermal organogenesis. Modern molecular genetics will increasingly elucidate the basic defects of the different syndromes and yield more insight into the regulatory mechanisms of embryology. In this way, a reclassification of ectodermal dysplasias will be possible according to the function of their involved mutated genes. Lamartine recently proposed a helpful classification according to the functions of the genes discovered in different types of ectodermal dysplasias. Accordingly, the present overview categorizes the various ectodermal dysplasias into four major functional subgroups: cell-cell communication and signaling, adhesion, transcription regulation, and development."
1404295,"Cartilage-hair hypoplasia (CHH) is an autosomal recessive form of metaphyseal chondrodysplasia characterised by short limbed short stature, hypoplastic hair growth, and impaired cell mediated immunity and erythrocyte production. The syndrome is exceptionally prevalent among the Finns and among the Old Order Amish in the United States; sporadic cases have been reported from other countries. An epidemiological and genetic study of CHH in Finland showed 107 patients, 46 males and 61 females, in 85 families. Eighteen of them had died, seven before the age of 1 year. The living patients ranged in age from 1 to 51 years, median 21 years. The incidence was estimated to be 1:23,000 live births. Consanguinity was found in two families and interfamilial relationships in 20 families. Geographical distribution of the birth places of the patients and their great grandparents showed accumulation in a small area in western Finland and regional clusters were seen in other parts of the country as well. The result of the segregation analysis was in accordance with recessive inheritance with reduced penetrance."
16342653,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence and prognosis of peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) in rural Haiti. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Prospectively identified patients with PPCM treated at the Hospital Albert Schweitzer (HAS), Deschapelles, Haiti, were included in this study. Patients who presented to HAS from February 1, 2000, to January 31, 2005, were identified through a search of the HAS PPCM Registry. Clinical and serial echocardiographic data were collected on these patients. RESULTS: The 5-year experience confirms the high incidence of PPCM in this area, approximately 1 case per 300 live births, which is severalfold the estimated incidence in the United States (estimated 1 case per 3000 to 4000 live births). In this population, the ratio of PPCM deaths for the 5-year period was 47.1 per 100,000 births compared with the US ratio of 0.62 per 100,000 births. The mortality rate was 15.3% (15 deaths of 98 patients), and the mean follow-up was 2.2 years (range, 1 month to 5 years). Five years after the initiation of the HAS PPCM Registry search, 26 (28%) of 92 patients with PPCM observed for at least 6 months had regained normal left ventricular function. The difference in left ventricular echocardiographic features at diagnosis between deceased patients and survivors was not statistically significant: mean end-diastolic dimension (6.2 vs 5.8 cm; P=.08), ejection fraction (22% vs 25%; P=.12), and fractional shortening (16% vs 15%; P=.46). Left ventricular echocardiographic features at diagnosis were unable to predict individually who would eventually recover, although a statistically significant difference occurred at diagnosis between the recovered group and nonrecovered group for mean ejection fraction (28% vs 23%; P<.001) and fractional shortening (17% vs 14%; P=.004). CONCLUSION: Peripartum cardiomyopathy occurs significantly more commonly in rural Haiti on a per capita basis than in the United States. Patients with PPCM have a higher mortality rate and a poorer return of normal ventricular function."
8092190,"Limb-body wall complex is a malformation of body and limbs with craniofacial defects. We describe here the epidemiology of this complex using the population-based registry data in the Kanagawa Birth Defects Monitoring Program during the period 1982-1991. Eleven infants (11/428,599 births) with the complex were ascertained in the study. The incidence and spectrum of the defects observed in our cases were similar to those of other studies. The parental ages in the study group were not significantly different from those in the general population. No teratogenic agents and factors were identified in the present study. Most cases were diagnosed prenatally."
16647997,"Since the description of Rett syndrome, only a handful of epidemiologic studies based only on clinical investigation have been reported. Mutations in the MECP2 gene are associated with Rett syndrome and French laboratories have organized a clinical and molecular network to investigate the incidence of Rett syndrome in France including the results of molecular investigations. The present study, based on a large cohort of 424 patients with Rett syndrome, found that the incidence of this disease with a MECP2 mutation varied between 0.43 to 0.71 per 10,000 females. The total population of females aged 4-15 years in November 2004 in France was estimated to be 4,337,627. The data presented here indicate a prevalence of Rett syndrome of 0.558 per 10,000 females aged 4-15 years in France. The incidence of Rett syndrome is in accordance with other European epidemiologic studies based on clinical examination. Given that this is a minimum incidence because complete inventory was not possible, this study of patients with Rett syndrome reinforces the fact that the great majority of patients with Rett syndrome have a MECP2 mutation."
25298019,"INTRODUCTION:Limited epidemiological data on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) exist in defined geographic areas in the United States. METHODS:Neurologists submitted case reports for patients under their care between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2011, who met the El Escorial criteria. Diagnosis was confirmed for a sample of cases by the consulting neurologist. Death certificate data were used for supplemental case identification. RESULTS:The 248 reported cases were most likely to be 50-69 years old, men, white, and non-Hispanic. The total crude average annual incidence rate was 1.46 per 100,000 person-years. CONCLUSIONS:The reported demographic characteristics were consistent with previously published findings. The crude annual incidence was slightly lower than the expected rate of 1.6 but was within the range reported previously (0.7-2.5). These findings help quantify the burden of ALS in the United States."
29039164,"OBJECTIVE:To analyze the results and follow up data of screening for newborn organic aciduria in Zhejiang province. METHODS:The results and follow-up data of 1 861 262 newborns from Zhejiang province undergoing screening for organic aciduria during January 2009 and December 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. The acylcarnitine spectrum in urine samples was detected by tandem mass spectrum (MS/MS) and the positive patients were confirmed by urine gas chromatography mass spectrometry and/or gene analysis. RESULTS:Ninety two cases of organic aciduria were confirmed with a prevalence of 1:20 200. Among 40 cases of methylmalonic academia (MMA), 13 (32.5%) were of MMA simple type and 27 (67.5%) were combined type. Genetic analysis showed 6 cases of MUT type and 1 case of CblB type out of 7 patients with MMA simple type, 10 cases of CblC and 1 case of CblF out of 11 patients with combined type, respectively. Six patients had propionic academia with a prevalence of 1:310 200, 7 had isovaleric academia (1:265 900), 6 had glutaric academia type 1 (1:310 200), 27 had 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase deficiency (MCC, 1:68 900), 1 had 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric aciduria (1:1 861 300), 2 had β-ketothiolase deficiency (1:960 600), and 3 had biotinidase deficiency/holocarboxylase synthetase deficiency (1:620 400). Thirty-one patients had a disease onset at neonatal period, and 15 at post-neonatal period. Thirty-three patients had brain involvements or cranial imaging disorders. Three patients with MMA had kidney diseases or heomlytic uremic syndrome, and 3 had myocardial impairments. Twenty patients died during the follow-up. CONCLUSIONS:MMA is the most common newborn organic aciduria in Zhejiang province. Except MCC, most organic aciduria may lead to metabolism decompensation, complications or even death."
7904097,"In a retrospective study of 12 patients with Behçet's disease, more than half were found to originate from the Near East, where the prevalence of the disease is known to be high. The immigrant patients were all males, whereas 3 of the 5 patients with Swedish ancestry were females. Certain differences emerged between the two groups, including different sex ratio and absence of HLA B5 association and pathergy skin reaction among the Swedish patients. Moreover, serious neurological and ocular symptoms showing no tendency to recede with age afflicted all the Swedish female patients. Urogenital symptoms were, besides ulcers, common in both groups, including prostatitis, urethritis, orchitis, chronic sterile cystitis and relapsing salpingitis. Although the maternal does not allow statistical inferences, the estimated prevalence was higher than expected among both Swedish and immigrant patients. Recent studies, including the diagnostic criteria proposed by the ""International Study Group for Behçet's disease"", are discussed in relation to previously used criteria as well as present findings. The sensitivity and specificity of the first mentioned criteria and the ones proposed by Mason & Barnes seemed equal."
23290691,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of systemic sclerosis (SSc) in the Lorraine region, France. METHODS: Data from three sources - general practitioners and community and hospital specialists, medical records departments, and regional and national laboratories-and a capture-recapture method with log-linear models were used to estimate SSc prevalence in the region. Double recording was checked, and reported cases were validated after a review of medical records. RESULTS: We identified 560 records of suspected SSc cases corresponding to 327 unique suspected SSc cases existing on June 30, 2006, in Lorraine. On the basis of the 193 validated cases (22 [11.4%] with diffuse disease, 136 [70.5%] with limited disease, 31 [16.1%] with limited involvement and 4 unknown), the observed overall crude prevalence of SSc was 105.4 cases per million adult inhabitants (95% confidence interval [CI]: 91.0; 121.4). With the capture-recapture method, the estimated number of SSc cases was 233 (95% CI: 217.3; 260.0), so an estimated 40 cases were not identified by the three sources. The estimated overall prevalence was 132.2 cases per million adult inhabitants (95% CI: 115.8; 154.0). CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides the first estimate of SSc prevalence in the Lorraine region. The capture-recapture method allowed us to estimate an additional 21% of unobserved cases and is a good alternative to the community-based study design for estimating the prevalence of rare diseases."
2090319,"A 13-year incidence study of sex chromosome abnormalities in Arhus, Denmark of 34,910 newborn children showed that 1 per 448 had a sex chromosome abnormality. The incidences of the most common sex chromosome abnormalities were Klinefelter syndrome, 1 per 576 boys; XYY, 1 per 851 boys; triple X, 1 per 897 girls; Turner syndrome, 1 per 2130 girls. Follow-up of children with autosomal abnormalities is not included in this study. None of the 78 surviving children with sex chromosome abnormalities was mentally retarded. All children above school age attended regular schools. Seventy-seven percent of Klinefelter, triple X, and XYY children aged 15-19 had received remedial teaching, 29% were receiving remedial teaching at the last follow-up, 32% had been in special classes at a regular school due to learning problems, and 24% were still in such classes at the last time of follow-up. There was no increased frequency of criminal activity or behavior disorders, nor was there any increased frequency of mental or physical disorders. The distribution of planned training or occupation for the 25 youths with sex chromosome abnormalities between 15 and 19 years of age was similar to that of their sibs. Testosterone undecanoate treatment has been given to Klinefelter boys from puberty and growth hormone treatment to Turner girls from the age of 7, and very small doses of estrogen were given to these girls from around the age of 12 when FSH was increasing to postmenopausal levels. Prevention or reduction of deviations in mental development from the normal range in children with sex chromosome abnormalities is possible if educational and social resources are available and the parents are well informed and counseled regularly. Information in Denmark has been given in part by publishing four booklets about triple X, XYY, Turner, and Klinefelter syndrome. Information, support, and stimulation to self-help have, to a certain extent, been given through contact groups. Parents having a child with a sex chromosome abnormality need information, counseling, and assistance. The type and magnitude of this assistance depend on the individual child, the specific sex chromosome abnormality, and the parents' own resources, psychologically, socially, and otherwise."
17092455,"The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of, incidence of, and survival from childhood neuronal lipofuscinoses in Norway. All children with neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses living in Norway are referred to the Tambartun National Resource Centre for the Visually Impaired. We based the data collection on the medical records at Tambartun. We identified 70 children with neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses who were born in Norway from 1957 to 1998. Seven had a diagnosis of late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses, and 63 had the juvenile form of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses. In 2005, the prevalence of childhood neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses was 8.3 per million inhabitants in Norway, and all children were diagnosed with the juvenile form. The average annual incidence rate of childhood neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses was 1.8 per 100,000 live births using the years from 1957 to 1978 and 3.9 using the years from 1978 to 1999. The trend in incidence increased at an annual rate of about 3.3% per year (P = .001), averaged over this period. Restricted to the most recent period (1967-1998), the trend was much weaker (1.4% increase per year; P = .3), and confidence intervals included the possibility of no trend. The median age at death of children diagnosed with late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses was 12 years (95% confidence interval 9-14) and 26 years (95% confidence interval 25-30) for children diagnosed with the juvenile form. The results did not support the hypothesis that children with neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses born in 1975 or later lived longer than those born from 1957 to 1975 (relative risk 1.0, 95% confidence interval 0.36-2.8). Mortality was similar for both genders (hazard ratio 0.97, 95% confidence interval 0.4-2.2)."
9375719,"Apert syndrome was studied to determine birth prevalence, mutation rate, sex ratio, parents' age, and ethnicity among 2,493,331 live births registered in the California Birth Defects Monitoring Program (CBDMP) from 1983 through 1993; 31 affected infants were identified. The sample was completed with an additional 22 cases from the Center for Craniofacial Anomalies (CCA), University of California, San Francisco, for a total of 53 affected children. Birth prevalence, calculated from the CBDMP subsample, was 12.4 cases per million live births (confidence interval [CI] 8.6,17.9). The calculated mutation rate was 6.2 x 10(-6) per gene per generation. Asians had the highest prevalence (22.3 per million live births; CI 7.1,61.3) and Hispanics the lowest (7.6 per million, CI 3.3-16.4). In the large population-based CBDMP subsample, there was an almost equal number of affected males and females, (sex ratio 0.94) but in the clinical CCA subsample, there were more affected females (sex ratio 0.79). For all cases, the mean age of mothers was 28.9+/-6.0 years, and of fathers was 34.1+/-6.2 years. Almost half of fathers were older than 35 years when the child was born; for more than 20% of cases, both parents were older than 35 years. These findings may support the view that point mutations appear to be more commonly associated with paternal than with maternal alleles. Representing the largest systematically ascertained population-based study of Apert syndrome to date, they provide a reliable basis for genetic counseling and decision-making, and for focused research to define the cause of this syndrome."
1673177,"We measured the prevalence and incidence of Becker muscular dystrophy in the Northern Health Region of England, UK. Patients were identified from the records of the Regional Neurological Centre and Muscular Dystrophy Group laboratories, Newcastle upon Tyne, and by writing to local doctors. We used cDNA probes and/or dystrophin immunolabelling of muscle-biopsy samples to prove the diagnosis of all cases. Results were compared with the known prevalence and incidence of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. 73 patients alive and resident in the Northern Health Region were identified, giving a prevalence rate of 2.38/100,000. This compares with a prevalence of Duchenne muscular dystrophy of 2.48/100,000. The cumulative birth incidence of Becker muscular dystrophy (at least 1 in 18 450 male live births) was about one third that of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (1 in 5618 male live births), suggesting that the disorder is more common than previously thought."
9061661,"Cutaneous lupus erythematosus may be related to maternal autoantibody production in the neonatal lupus syndrome, or may occur later in childhood, with or without findings of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In the first section, we will discuss the transient, passively transferred neonatal disease, and in the second, we will discuss the persistent, actively acquired forms of lupus erythematosus in childhood."
28155235,"The Danish Huntington's Disease Registry (DHR) is a nationwide family registry comprising 14 245 individuals from 445 Huntington's disease (HD) families of which the largest family includes 845 individuals in 8 generations. 1136 DNA and/or blood samples and 18 fibroblast cultures are stored in a local biobank. The birthplace of the oldest HD carrier in each of the 261 families of Danish origin was unevenly distributed across Denmark with a high number of families in the middle part of the peninsula Jutland and in Copenhagen, the capital. The prevalence of HD in Denmark was calculated to be 5-8:100 000. 1451 individuals in the DHR had the size of the HTT CAG repeat determined of which 975 had 36 CAG repeats or more (mean ± SD: 43,5 ± 4,8). Two unrelated individuals were compound heterozygous for alleles ≥36 CAGs, and 60 individuals from 34 independent families carried an intermediate allele."
8624690,"A series of patients affected by a muscular dystrophy, similar to the original description of a juvenile scapulo-humeral form by Erb in 1884 and fitting with the criteria used to define limb-girdle muscular dystrophies, was discovered in a small community living in the southern part of Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean. A detailed clinical analysis was conducted over 5 years on a cohort of 20 patients. This community presented a high degree of consanguinity as it was segregated from the majority of the island population for more than a century. In previous molecular genetic studies, the disease locus has been mapped to chromosome 15p. Mutations were recently identified in a gene located in this region encoding for muscle-specific calcium activated neutral protease (CANP3). Clinical, pathological, genetic and complete identification of the mutations are presented here, establishing, for the first time, precise clinico-genetic correlations in this form of autosomal recessive, juvenile, limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD)."
18202348,"Acquired pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a syndrome characterized by pulmonary surfactant accumulation occurring in association with granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor autoantibodies (autoimmune PAP) or as a consequence of another disease (secondary PAP). Because PAP is rare, prior reports were based on limited patient numbers or a synthesis of historical data.To describe the epidemiologic, clinical, physiologic, and laboratory features of autoimmune PAP in a large, contemporaneous cohort of patients with PAP.Over 6 years, 248 patients with PAP were enrolled in a Japanese national registry, including 223 with autoimmune PAP.Autoimmune PAP represented 89.9% of cases and had a minimum incidence and prevalence of 0.49 and 6.2 per million, respectively. The male to female ratio was 2.1:1, and the median age at diagnosis was 51 years. A history of smoking occurred in 56%, and dust exposure occurred in 23%; instances of familial onset did not occur. Dyspnea was the most common presenting symptom, occurring in 54.3%. Importantly, 31.8% of patients were asymptomatic and were identified by health screening. Intercurrent illnesses, including infections, were infrequent. A disease severity score reflecting the presence of symptoms and degree of hypoxemia correlated well with carbon monoxide diffusing capacity and serum biomarkers, less well with pulmonary function, and not with granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor autoantibody levels or duration of disease.Autoimmune PAP had an incidence and prevalence higher than previously reported and was not strongly linked to smoking, occupational exposure, or other illnesses. The disease severity score and biomarkers provide novel and potentially useful outcome measures in PAP."
21398332,"OBJECTIVES: Mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) is an immune-mediated, systemic disorder of unknown aetiology. As the epidemiology of the disease is largely unknown, the authors performed a nationwide cross-sectional retrospective study to assess the prevalence and incidence of MCTD in Norway. METHODS: Every adult patient (≥ 18 years) with MCTD seen at one of the departments of rheumatology was reviewed for inclusion. Only patients who satisfied the following four criteria were included: clinical diagnosis of MCTD verified by a rheumatologist; positive serum anti-ribonucleoprotein antibody test; fulfilment of at least one of three of following criteria sets: the modified Sharp's criteria, the criteria of Alarcón-Segovia and Villareal and those of Kasukawa; and exclusion of other connective tissue diseases. RESULTS: The four inclusion criteria were fulfilled by 147 adult Caucasian patients. The female to male ratio was 3.3 and the mean age at diagnosis of adult-onset MCTD was 37.9 years (95% CI 35.3 to 40.4 years). At the end of 2008, the point prevalence of living adult MCTD patients in Norway was 3.8 (95% CI 3.2 to 4.4) per 100,000 adults. The incidence of adult-onset MCTD in Norway during the period from 1996 to 2005 was 2.1 (95% CI 1.7 to 2.5) per million per year. CONCLUSIONS: MCTD has a female predominance and the incidence and prevalence of MCTD is low, and lower than reported figures for polymyositis, dermatomyositis, systemic sclerosis and systemic lupus erythematosus. The prevalence estimates were similar across the three criteria sets of MCTD."
15192785,"The incidence rates of cholangiocarcinoma (CC) vary greatly among different areas of the world, and this variation is related to distribution of risk factors. Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) and extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ECC) have different epidemiological features. Recent data show that the incidence and mortality rates of ICC have been increasing in several areas around the world. On the other hand, the incidence and mortality rates of ECC have been decreasing. For example, in the United States, the age-adjusted incidence rates of ICC increased by 165% from 0.32 per 100,000 in 1975 to 1979 to 0.85 per 100,000 in 1995 to 1999, whereas ECC declined by 14%. In the meantime, there has been very little improvement in long-term survival, which remains dismal (3.5%). Men are affected 1.5 times more than women are, and Asians are affected almost 2 times more than whites and blacks. There are few well-established risk factors for CC, including primary sclerosing cholangitis, liver fluke infestations, hepatolithiasis, Thorotrast exposure, and choledochal cysts. None of these risk factors can explain the recent increasing trends of ICC in the United States. Some data, however, point to a potential role for chronic liver disease, hepatitis C, and probably hepatitis B infections in the development of ICC."
29877043,"Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a neutrophilic dermatosis characterised by painful, necrotic ulcerations. PG is described as a rare disease: the world-wide incidence is estimated to be around 3 to 10 cases per million population per year. These estimations are based mostly on case reports and retrospective case series; there are no prospective, multicentre studies on the matter. The apparent rarity of PG is in contrast with our clinical perception as dermatologists: in our opinion, PG is not so uncommon. Therefore, we decide to investigate the epidemiology of PG in the Italian population and confirm our clinical suspicions that it is not an orphan disease. We enrolled all patients diagnosed with PG in 8 Italian Dermatological Departments from 1st October 2014 to 1st November 2015, and we recorded their features. Our data, collected from 64 patients, are in accordance with those of the published literature regarding the epidemiology and features of PG. In an Italian population of roughly 8 million inhabitants of 7 provinces, we found an incidence of 5.17 new cases per million population per year. Unlike our predictions before the study, we confirmed the world-wide incidence of PG. To our knowledge, this is the first observational, multicentre study on PG. We hope that it provides a stimulus for further researches on PG and for the creation of an Italian register."
9547007,"Gelsolin-related familial amyloidosis, Finnish type, occurs worldwide, most likely as a result of sporadic low-frequency mutations. Two mutations at nucleotide 654 in the gelsolin gene have been demonstrated, which result in a characteristic triad of ophthalmologic, neurologic and dermatologic manifestations distinct from other amyloidoses. Some phenotypic variation, particularly in the age of onset and severity of manifestations, occurs but in general the disease is clinically rather homogeneous. Systemic deposition of amyloid is found in most tissues, predominantly in blood vessel walls and associated with basement membranes. The mutations result in amino acid substitutions with a charge change in the gelsolin molecule, postulated to alter the susceptibility for proteases thereby rendering the molecule amyloidogenic. Gelsolin fragments constitute the amyloid fibrils, but abnormal fragments also occur in patients' plasma and CSF providing evidence for the role of aberrant proteolysis in the disease pathomechanism. This is further strengthened by in vitro expression analyses showing both disease-related mutations to result in secretion of an abnormal gelsolin fragment, the likely precursor protein of gelsolin amyloid. Of the two forms of gelsolin, secretory and cytoplasmic, the secretory plasma form is the likely source of amyloid. The origin of the systemic amyloid deposits is not known but, beside a circulatory origin, local synthesis and deposition is an attractive pathomechanical alternative. The final goal of preventing or curing this disease has come closer, but still awaits further comprehensive pathological, functional and experimental studies in order to dissect all pathogenetically important events."
10199027,"OBJECTIVE: Wiedemann-Beckwith syndrome is a multisystemic pattern of congenital anomalies with overgrowth. The most characteristic clinical features are macroglossia, high birth weight, omphalocele, visceromegaly and hypoglycemia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We show the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of the 18 cases with Wiedemann-Beckwith syndrome identified in the consecutive series of 25,967 malformed liveborn infants detected among 1,431,368 livebirths surveyed by the Spanish Collaborative Study of Congenital Malformations (ECEMC) between April 1976 and June 1997. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The minimal estimated frequency of Wiedemann-Beckwith syndrome in Spain is 0.13 per 10,000 liveborn infants. These infants have a high birth weight for their gestational age and are born of shorter pregnancies (prematurity 33.3%). The clinical manifestations of our cases are concordant with the variable expression of the syndrome; the most frequent features were macroglossia (100%), omphalocele or umbilical hernia (77.8%) and high birth weight (64.7%). Other findings were polyhydramnios and placentomegaly. All of the cases were sporadic."
2518509,"A point prevalence study of von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis (NF-1) was undertaken in greater Dunedin, New Zealand, having a base population of 113,700. A total of 52 individuals with NF-1 were identified, for a crude prevalence estimate of 45.7 per 100,000 (95% confidence interval 31.6-59.8 per 100,000) or 1 in 2,190 and an age-standardized prevalence of 48.5 per 100,000 (95% confidence interval 34.7-62.4 per 100,000) or 1 in 2,062. This is the highest prevalence estimate reported to date. This is presumed most likely to be due to a small population effect. The prevalence of NF correlated with age, being greatest among those aged 20-29 years and relatively low among those 60 or more years of age."
9231935,"Using the Huntington's disease register for South Wales, a total of 86 affected individuals were identified living in the counties of Mid Glamorgan, South Glamorgan and Gwent, giving a point prevalence rate for Huntington's Disease in South East Wales of 6.2/100,000. Only four (4.7%) of these individuals developed their symptoms after the age of 60 years. A subsequent retrospective search of the register identified a total of 33 individuals with clinical evidence of Huntington's disease and whose age of onset of symptoms occurred between the ages of 60 and 77 years. In this group the median time for disease duration from the onset of symptoms was 13 years (range 0.5-25 years), with survival up to age 86 years recorded. Initial symptoms of Huntington's disease included disturbance of gait in 32 individuals; 31 had involuntary movements, and 20 had abnormality of speech. Major psychiatric symptoms were present in only six cases; but approximately a third (ten cases) had symptoms related to impaired cognitive function. Molecular analysis was possible on ten individuals in the series. The expanded CAG repeat sequence in the Huntington's disease gene was found in all cases, with a narrow range of 36-38 repeats, representing the smallest repeats seen in our Huntington's disease group. Our study suggests that Huntington's disease in elderly people causes predominantly motor disturbance at onset with relatively mild disability and a favourable outlook for both independent living and for life expectancy. However, the potential for under-diagnosis in this age group may have considerable genetic consequences, with transmission of the disorder to numerous descendants by the time its hereditary nature is recognized."
23192520,"Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterised by autonomic dysfunction with parkinsonism (MSAp) or cerebellar (MSAc) symptoms. At autopsy, α-synuclein inclusions in glial cells of the brain are needed to confirm a definite diagnosis. We determined the 10 year incidence of MSA, point prevalence and survival in a well defined population with a high number of neurologists.Cases were identified from the only neurology department and all practising neurologists in Iceland, over a 10 year period. The diagnosis of MSA was in accordance with the Second Consensus Criteria of MSA.19 incidence cases were diagnosed with MSA (11 women, eight men) during the study period, giving an average annual incidence of 0.7:100 000 (95% CI 0.4 to 1.1). Ten cases were alive on the prevalence day, giving a point prevalence of 3.4:100 000 (95% CI 1.6 to 6.3). 16 of the cases had probable and three possible MSA; 16 had MSAp and three had MSAc. Mean age at symptom onset was 65 years and mean age at diagnosis was 68 years. Patients were followed for an average of 31 months, and 15 died during the follow-up period. Survival from symptom onset was mean 5.7 years. The 1 and 5 year survival rates from diagnosis were 74% and 28%, respectively.We reported on the incidence of MSA (both MSAp and MSAc) in a nationwide study where a definite diagnosis of MSA was confirmed in four out of five patients autopsied. We found survival to be shorter than reported in other studies."
21712629,"The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of developmental dental anomalies in an Indian population and to statistically analyze the distribution of these anomalies. The study was based on clinical examination, evaluation of dental casts, and panoramic radiographs of 1123 Indian subjects (572 males, 551 females), who visited the outpatient clinic at Government Dental College, Indore between November 2009 and September 2010, after obtaining their informed consent. These patients were examined for the following developmental dental anomalies: shape anomalies (microdontia, talon cusp, dens evaginatus, fusion, taurodontism), number anomalies (hypodontia, oligodontia, anodontia), structural anomalies (amelogenesis imperfecta, dentinogenesis imperfecta) and positional anomalies (ectopic eruption, rotation, impaction). The percentages of these anomalies were assessed for the whole group and compared using statistical analysis. Among the 1123 subjects, a total of 385 individuals (34.28%) presented with the selected developmental dental anomalies. The distribution by sex was 197 males (34.44%), and 188 females (34.06%). Out of the total 1123 individuals, 351 (31.26%) exhibited at least one anomaly, 28 (2.49 %) showed two anomalies and 6 (0.53%) displayed more than two anomalies. P values indicated that the dental anomalies were statistically independent of sex. On intergroup comparison, positional anomalies were significantly most prevalent (P < 0.05) in the Indian population. The most common developmental dental anomaly was rotation (10.24%), followed by ectopic eruption (7.93%). The next common group was number anomalies. The most common number anomaly was hypodontia (4.19%), which had a higher frequency than hyperdontia (2.40%). Analyzing the next prevalent group of shape anomalies, microdontia (2.58%) was found to be the most common, followed by taurodontism (2.49%), dens evaginatus (2.40%) and talon cusp (0.97%). Dentinogenesis imperfecta (0.09%) was the rarest, followed by amelogenesis imperfecta (0.27%) and fusion (0.27%)."
8042673,"One hundred eighteen cases of nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS, Gorlin's syndrome or basal cell nevus syndrome) are presented in this study. In aiming to ascertain all the affected families in Australia, we have examined the largest series to date. Relative frequencies of associated complications are presented and compared with those of the recent English survey by Evans et al. [J Med Genet 30:460-464, 1993]. The frequencies of most manifestations are similar. However, one major difference is that the multiple basal cell carcinomas are manifest from an earlier age in the Australian population, which probably reflects greater exposure to ultraviolet radiation. Of the 64 families ascertained, 37 represented simplex cases, and, accordingly, the apparent new mutation rate is surprisingly high (14-81%) given the lack of impact of NBCCS on reproductive capabilities. There is some evidence to suggest that this may be attributable to anticipation."
20432804,"BACKGROUND:Neonatal screening programs for congenital hypothyroidism (CH) are now widespread in developed countries. AIM:Cord blood thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) was evaluated for the incidence of CH in Bahrain Defense Force hospital. METHODS:Those neonates with cord blood TSH values >25 mU/l were recalled. Permanent CH was reported when the levels of TSH and free T4 (fT4) venous blood samples were > or =15 mUl and <12 pmol/l, respectively, with abnormal thyroid scan. RESULTS:Of 714 recalled newborns, 23 (10 males and 13 females) were diagnosed with transient TSH elevation with an estimated incidence of 1:774 births and 6 (3 males and 3 females) were diagnosed with permanent CH with an overall estimated incidence of 1:2,967 births. CONCLUSIONS:High incidence rates for CH reported in this hospital-based study suggest the need for a national screening program for this congenital endocrine disorder in the Kingdom of Bahrain."
9041292,"OBJECTIVE:Biliary atresia is the leading cause of extrahepatic obstructive jaundice in the newborn and is the single most frequent indication for liver transplantation in children. The cause of biliary atresia is unknown, although several mechanisms have been postulated to explain the inflammatory process that obliterates the bile ducts. Most interest has been directed toward viral infections. Information about the epidemiologic characteristics of biliary atresia in well-defined populations is lacking but is essential for developing and addressing hypotheses of causation for the disease. METHODS:Infants with biliary atresia were identified in metropolitan Atlanta from 1968 through 1993 by a population-based birth defects surveillance system that ascertains infants with serious birth defects in the first year of life using active case ascertainment. Birth prevalence rates were analyzed for spatial and temporal clustering and effects attributable to county of residence, sex, race, maternal age, parity, and birth weight. Logistic regression was used to study the independent effects of the risk factors and to look for interactions. RESULTS:Fifty-seven infants with biliary atresia were identified, for a rate of 0.73 per 10,000 live births. There was significant seasonal clustering of the disease, with rates three times higher from December through March compared with rates from April through July. Rates were significantly higher among nonwhite infants compared with white infants (0.96 vs 0.44 per 10,000 live births) and infants born at term with low birth weights (<2500 g) compared with infants born at term with normal birth weights (> or = 2500 g) (2.62 vs 0.75 per 10,000 live births). CONCLUSIONS:Our study is the first in the United States to describe the epidemiologic characteristics of biliary atresia using a population-based approach. The demonstration of significant seasonal clustering provides support for theories that biliary atresia may be caused by environmental exposure (consistent with a viral cause) during the perinatal period."
8459248,"In a population based study of the prevalence of Wilson's disease in the Republic of Ireland from 1970-89, 26 definite and probable cases were ascertained. The adjusted birth incidence rate was 17.0 per million live births (95% (confidence interval 9.9 to 27.2)) for the 20 year period 1950-69. The gene frequency was 0.41% (95% (confidence interval 0.31% to 0.52%) indicating that one in 122 of the population was a gene carrier. Allowing for a maximal degree of consanguinity, the gene frequency is reduced to 0.36% and the proportion of heterozygotes to one in 139 of the population. The consistency of the adjusted birth incidence rates over the decades 1950-59 and 1960-69 suggests a high degree of ascertainment of diagnosed cases of Wilson's disease."
9587032,"Newborn screening for cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency (homocystinuria; HCU) was started in the late 1960s using a bacterial inhibition assay (BIA). At least seven countries have either national or regional screening programmes; 12 programmes are known to have discontinued. The worldwide incidence of HCU is approximately 1 in 335,000 but varies from 1:65,000 (Ireland) to 1:900,000 (Japan). Methodologies include the BIA, one-dimensional or thin-layer amino acid chromatography and, more recently, tandem mass spectrometry. The BIA diagnostic cut off concentration of blood methionine varies from 67 to 270 micromol/ (10-40 mg/l) with a median of 135 micromol/l (20 mg/l). In Ireland, 25 cases of HCU from 19 families have been identified from 1.58 million newborn infants since 1971; 21 cases were detected through the screening programme. Of the four missed cases, three were breast-fed at the time of blood collection and one was pyridoxine responsive. These findings were in broad agreement with the results from five other programmes, in which approximately one in every five cases was missed by the screening programme. Early hospital discharge, low protein intake, high blood methionine cut-off concentration and pyridoxine responsiveness were all identified as contributing to missed cases."
27007794,"In Denmark, the occurrence of Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) has continuously been monitored since 1944. We provide here a summary of 70 years of data collection including registered lines and subjects by the end of 2012.Affected individuals were identified from a national register of hereditary eye diseases at the National Eye Clinic (NEC), a tertiary low vision rehabilitation center for the entire Danish population. The assembling of LHON pedigrees was based on the reconstruction of published families and newly diagnosed cases from 1980 to 2012 identified in the files of NEC. Genealogic follow-up on the maternal ancestry of all affected individuals was performed to identify a possible relation to an already known maternal line. A full genotypic characterization of the nation-based LHON cohort is provided.Forty different lines were identified. The number of live affected individuals with a verified mitochondrial DNA mutation was 104 on January 1, 2013, which translates to a prevalence rate of 1:54,000 in the Danish population.Haplogroup distribution as well as mutational spectrum of the Danish LHON cohort do not deviate from those of other European populations. The genealogic follow-up reveals a relatively high turnover among families with approximately 15 newly affected families per century and the dying out of earlier maternal lines."
7718765,"To determine the prevalence of the myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) in Japan, we conducted a nationwide survey in 1991. The survey included the sex, birth date and type of MDS of the patients from all (n = 2315) hospitals with 200 beds or more and 188 hospitals randomly selected from 7526 hospitals (1/40) with 199 beds or less. The point prevalence of MDS was estimated to be almost 3000 as of September 1, 1991, and it was 3.4 per 100,000 men of 15 years old or older and 2.1 per 100,000 women of 15 years old or older. Refractory anemia (RA) was most common (51%) followed by RA with excess of blasts (RAEB; 18%) and RAEB in transformation (RAEB-t; 14%). RAEB, RAEB-t and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) showed a high male/female ratio (3.0 or higher) although the sex ratio of other types was almost 1.0."
9270572,"We used several case-findings methods and strict criteria for case ascertainment to diagnose parkinsonism and idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) in the Faroe Islands. In the last few years before the prevalence date of July 1, 1995, we searched various registries from pharmacies, hospitals, and general practices, and found 195 patients with suspected parkinsonism out of 43,709 inhabitants. After excluding those who died before the prevalence date or were treated with levodopa (LD) for other diseases, a total of 124 patients remained for study, of whom 122 participated. We found 102 patients with parkinsonism and 82 with PD versus the expected 53 (p < 0.001, age-specific prevalences in the county of Rogaland, Norway). The overall prevalence of PD was estimated to be 187.6 and the age-adjusted prevalence to be 183.3 versus 110.9 per 100,000 inhabitants in the county of Rogaland. Compared to the study from Rogaland, the mean age at onset of PD symptoms, the mean age at the prevalence date, and the duration of PD indicated that the higher prevalence was not due to either an early onset nor to a longer duration of PD. A lower proportion of definite PD, a lower mean score on the Hoehn-Yahr scale, and a lower average dose of LD suggest that the high prevalence may be due to early diagnosis and a higher ascertainment of cases with mild disease. However, a high incidence cannot be excluded."
7918034,"The descriptive epidemiology of hairy cell leukaemia is reported from a specialized register of haematological malignancies covering approximately one-third of England and Wales. The overall incidence of hairy cell leukaemia at 2.9 per million persons per year is similar to that recorded in America. There is a marked male preponderance (4.0 compared with 1.7 per million per year for females). A case-control study on hairy cell leukaemia was conducted in the Yorkshire and Trent Regional Health Authority areas. 50 cases and 95 controls were identified, and interviewed using a structured questionnaire. Previous results on the aetiology of hairy cell leukaemia were not supported by this study, with the exception of an association between hairy cell leukaemia and exposure to organic solvents, petrochemicals and related products."
15515780,"It has been observed that familial Mediterranean fever is more prevalent among people coming from central Anatolia in Turkey. To test this observation the frequency of FMF was investigated by afield survey in Sivas, a city located in central of Turkey.The survey was conducted in a cohort of 4809 persons selected by systematic sampling from 2 districts of Sivas, with a total population of 83,274. Face to face interviewing was done with registered households using a standard questionnaire developed to screen FMF A second interview was conducted by a rheumatologist and an internist of those individuals who were regarded to have possible FMF.The suspicion of FMF emerged in the cases of 46 individuals during the survey and 36 were interviewed for a second time. FMF was diagnosed in 10 cases. Only one had a previous diagnosis of FMF. The overall frequency of FMF among a cohort of 3,948 inhabitants of Sivas was 1/395 (0.25%).This study indicates that the prevalence of FMF in Sivas may be higher than that in general Turkish population, which has been reported to be 0.1%."
17277407,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to describe the incidence and clinical features of chronic eosinophilic pneumonia (CEP) in Iceland and review recent literature. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective study where information was obtained from clinical charts from 1990-2004. Records, imaging studies and histopathology were evaluated. RESULTS: During the study period 10 individuals were diagnosed with CEP, 7 males and 3 females. Mean age was 58 years. None of the patients was a current smoker. The incidence of CEP during the study period was 0.23 per 100,000/year but increased to 0.54 per 100,000/year during the last 5 years of the study period. Clinical symptoms were malaise, cough, dyspnea, sweating and weight loss. Sedimentation rate was 72 mm/h and C-reactive protein (CRP) 125 mg/L. Eight of the ten patients had increase in blood eosinophils. On chest auscultation crackles were heard in seven patients and wheezing in three. Forced vital capacity (FVC) was 75% of predicted value and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) was 73% of predicted. Mean PO2 was 68 mmHg. All the patients had classic diffuse bilateral opacities on chest radiograph that most commonly were peripheral. All patients were treated with corticosteroids and responded well. The average initial dose of Prednisolone was 42.5 mg per day. Seven of the patients relapsed but they all responded well to repeated treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia is a rare disorder but it has specific radiologic and histologic features. It is important to think of the disease in patients with diffuse infiltrates that are resistant to antibiotics. CEP responds well to corticosteroids but there is a high relapse rate, which also responds to treatment."
23588938,"Few studies based in well-defined North American populations have examined the occurrence of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), and none has been based in an ethnically diverse population. We used computerized healthcare information from the Kaiser Permanente Northern California membership to validate JIA diagnoses and estimate the incidence and prevalence of the disease in this well-characterized population.We identified children aged ≤ 15 years with ≥ 1 relevant International Classification of Diseases, 9th edition, diagnosis code of 696.0, 714, or 720 in computerized clinical encounter data during 1996-2009. In a random sample, we then reviewed the medical records to confirm the diagnosis and diagnosis date and to identify the best-performing case-finding algorithms. Finally, we used the case-finding algorithms to estimate the incidence rate and point prevalence of JIA.A diagnosis of JIA was confirmed in 69% of individuals with at least 1 relevant code. Forty-five percent were newly diagnosed during the study period. The age- and sex-standardized incidence rate of JIA per 100,000 person-years was 11.9 (95% CI 10.9-12.9). It was 16.4 (95% CI 14.6-18.1) in girls and 7.7 (95% CI 6.5-8.9) in boys. The peak incidence rate occurred in children aged 11-15 years. The prevalence of JIA per 100,000 persons was 44.7 (95% CI 39.1-50.2) on December 31, 2009.The incidence rate of JIA observed in the Kaiser Permanente population, 1996-2009, was similar to that reported in Rochester, Minnesota, USA, but 2 to 3 times higher than Canadian estimates."
11231987,"The main purpose was to assess the incidence and late outcome of Cushing's syndrome, particularly in Cushing's disease. Information for all patients diagnosed with Cushing's syndrome during an 11-yr period in Denmark was retrieved. The incidence was 1.2-1.7/million.yr (Cushing's disease), 0.6/million.yr (adrenal adenoma) and 0.2/million.yr (adrenal carcinoma). Other types of Cushing's syndrome were rare. In 139 patients with nonmalignant disease, 11.1% had died during follow-up (median, 8.1 yr; range, 3.1-14.0), yielding a standard mortality ratio (SMR) of 3.68 [95% confidence interval (CI), 2.34-5.33]. The SMR was partly attributable to an increased mortality within the first year after diagnosis. Eight patients died before treatment could be undertaken. The prognosis in patients with malignant disease was very poor. Patients in whom more than 5 yr had elapsed since initial surgery were studied separately, including a questionnaire on their perceived quality of health. In 45 patients with Cushing's disease who had been cured through transsphenoidal neurosurgery, only 1 had died (SMR, 0.31; CI, 0.01-1.72) compared with 6 of 20 patients with persistent hypercortisolism after initial neurosurgery (SMR, 5.06; CI, 1.86-11.0). In patients with adrenal adenoma, SMR was 3.95 (CI, 0.81-11.5). The perceived quality of health was significantly impaired only in patients with Cushing's disease and appeared independent of disease control or presence of hypopituitarism. It is concluded that 1) Cushing's syndrome is rare and is associated with increased mortality, in patients with no concurrent malignancy also; 2) the excess mortality was mainly observed during the first year of disease; and 3) the impaired quality of health in long-term survivors of Cushing's disease is not fully explained."
8026104,"The Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) syndrome comprises a heterogeneous group of disorders affecting the peripheral nerves and anterior horn cells of the spinal cord. They constitute a significant proportion of the burden of disability caused by single gene neurological disorders, with a disease prevalence of 16.7 per 10(5) of the South Wales adult population. The clinical and genetic characteristics of these diseases in the population are described. In those cases identified as type I hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy (HMSN I), we have shown that it is possible to correlate disease severity with age, and that there is no clinical evidence for imprinting, manifest either in age of onset or disease severity."
12469324,"Oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) is a genetically heterogeneous disorder. There are four known types of OCA: OCA1-OCA4. The clinical manifestations of all types of OCA include skin and hair hypopigmentation and visual impairment. Although there are a few documented observations of high frequency of albinism among Native Americans, including the Hopi, Zuni, Kuna, Jemez, Laguna, San Juan, and Navajo, no causative molecular defect has been previously reported. In the present study, we show that albinism in one Native American population, the Navajo, is caused by a LINE-mediated 122.5-kilobase deletion of the P gene, thus demonstrating that albinism in this population is OCA2. This deletion appears to be Navajo specific, because this allele was not detected in 34 other individuals with albinism who listed other Native American origins, nor has it been reported in any other ethnic group. The molecular characterization of this deletion allele allowed us to design a three-primer polymerase chain reaction system to estimate the carrier frequency in the Navajo population by screening 134 unrelated normally pigmented Navajos. The carrier frequency was found to be approximately 4.5%. The estimated prevalence of OCA2 in Navajos is between approximately 1 per 1,500 and 1 per 2,000. We further estimate that this mutation originated 400-1,000 years ago from a single founder."
17213273,"Mutations in the KCNJ11 and ABCC8 genes encoding the pancreatic beta-cell K(ATP) channel have recently been shown to be the most common cause of permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus (PNDM). Information regarding the frequency of PNDM has been based mainly on nonpopulation or short-term collections only. Thus, the aim of this study was to identify the incidence of PNDM in Slovakia and to switch patients to sulfonylurea (SU) where applicable.We searched for PNDM patients in the Slovak Children Diabetes Registry. In insulin-treated patients who matched the clinical criteria for PNDM, the KCNJ11 or ABCC8 genes were sequenced, and mutation carriers were invited for replacement of insulin with SU.Eight patients with diabetes onset before the sixth month of life without remission were identified since 1981, which corresponds to the PNDM incidence in Slovakia of one case in 215,417 live births. In four patients, three different KCNJ11 mutations were found (R201H, H46Y, and L164P). Three patients with the KCNJ11 mutations (R201H and H46Y) were switched from insulin to SU, decreasing their glycosylated hemoglobin from 9.3-11.0% on insulin to 5.7-6.6% on SU treatment. One patient has a novel V86A mutation in the ABCC8 gene and was also substituted with SU.PNDM frequency in Slovakia is much higher (one in 215,417 live births) than previously suggested from international estimates (about one in 800,000). We identified one ABCC8 and four KCNJ11 mutation carriers, of whom four were successfully transferred to SU, dramatically improving their diabetes control and quality of life."
10365582,"BACKGROUND:Bartter's syndrome (BS) is an inherited disease of renal potassium wasting characterized by hypokalemic alkalosis, normal blood pressure, vascular insensitivity to pressor agents and elevated plasma concentrations of renin and aldosterone. It is caused by generalized hyperplasia of the juxtaglomerular apparatus at the site of renin production caused by mutations in the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter gene, NKCC2. The objective of our study is to establish the prevalence and incidence of BS in Kuwait and to assess treatment modalities for it. METHODS AND RESULTS:Bartter's syndrome was diagnosed in 13 Kuwaiti children over a 14 year period (1981-1995) with the estimated incidence of 1.7/100,000 live births. The mean age at diagnosis was 9.3 months (range 2-32 months). There were five males and eight females (ratio 1:1.6). The mean duration of follow up was 5.6 years (1-14 years). Both consanguinity and familial history among our patients were high (69 and 54%, respectively). All patients had hypokalemia, hypochloremia with metabolic alkalosis, hyperreninemia and were normotensive. Clinical presentation was essentially similar to that in other series. Eleven patients (85%) had growth failure, two had nephrocalcinosis (15%) and one had renal failure. All patients were treated with supplemental potassium, an aldosterone antagonist (spironolactone) and a prostaglandin synthetase inhibitor (indomethacin or aspirin) sequentially. Significant catch-up of growth (four patients) and increases in serum potassium (eight patients) were recorded after administration of indomethacin therapy. One patient died of severe pneumonia with respiratory failure from hypokalemic myopathy. Clinical presentation, inheritance, complications and therapy of BS are briefly discussed. CONCLUSION:Bartter's syndrome is a rare disease, but should be considered in the differential diagnosis of other disorders with growth failure and/or hypokalemia. Early diagnosis, close follow up and compliance with treatment may lead to appropriate growth and development."
2785882,"This study establishes the prevalence rates at birth of the skeletal dysplasias which can be diagnosed in the perinatal period or during pregnancy. Using a population-based register of congenital anomalies, a prevalence rate of 3.22 0/000 was observed. The most frequent types of skeletal dysplasia were achondroplasia and osteogenesis imperfecta (0.64 0/000, 1/15,000 births), thanatophoric dysplasia and achondrogenesis (0.28 0/000). The mutation rate for achondroplasia was higher in our material than in the other studies: 3.3 x 10(-5) per gamete per generation. Our study demonstrates that prenatal diagnosis by ultrasound is possible in some skeletal dysplasias."
21798892,"The epidemiological manifestations of ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) differ geographically. However, there have been no prospective studies comparing the incidence of AAV between Japan and Europe over the same time period using the same case definitions.The incidence of AAV was determined by a population-based method in Miyazaki prefecture, Japan, and Norfolk, U.K., between 2005 and 2009. Patients with AAV were defined and classified according to the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) algorithm.The number of incident cases of AAV in Japan and the U.K. were 86 and 50, respectively, and the average annual incidence over the 5-year period was 22.6/million (95% CI 19.1, 26.2) and 21.8/million (95% CI 12.6, 30.9) in Japan and the U.K., respectively. The average age was higher in patients in Japan than in patients in the U.K. [mean (median), 69.7 (72) vs. 60.5 (61) years]. Microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) was the predominant subtype in Japan (83%), while granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's) was more frequent in the U.K. (66%). As for the pattern of ANCA positivity, >80% of Japanese patients were pANCA/MPO positive, whereas two-thirds of U.K. patients were cANCA/PR3 positive. Renal involvement in MPA was very common in both countries, but was much less common in granulomatosis with polyangiitis in Japan compared with the U.K.There was no major difference in AAV incidence between Japan and the U.K., but this prospective study found MPA and MPO-ANCA to be more common in Japan and granulomatosis with polyangiitis and PR3-ANCA to be more common in the U.K., in line with earlier reports."
16210862,"Few comprehensive epidemiological studies of the prevalence of muscle diseases have been undertaken, and none has been carried out in our locality. The present cross-sectional study was conducted in Assiut Governorate (Upper Egypt) to estimate the prevalence of different types of primary muscular disorder in 1997. The study involved 52,203 subjects, 15,617 (30%) from the rural community and 36,586 (70%) from the urban community. Patients were identified from a door-to-door survey, and all were subjected to a full clinical examination, with confirmation of the diagnosis through electrophysiological, and biochemical investigations. Histopathological studies were performed for the classification of muscular dystrophies. Forty patients with muscular disorders were identified, with a point prevalence of 76.6 per 100,000 in the total community with no significant differences between the rural and urban communities. The creatine kinase level was abnormally high (>225 IU/l) in 80% of the cases, increased in all patients with muscular dystrophy or myositis, in 88.8% of patients with systemic myopathy and 66.6% of patients with myotonia. None of the cases of myasthenia showed an increase in the creatine kinase level. The lifetime prevalence per 100,000 was 26.8 for muscular dystrophy, 11.49 for myotonia, 11.49 for myositis, 17.24 for systemic myopathy and 9.57 for myasthenia."
16509526,"OBJECTIVE:To evaluate the effectiveness of a second newborn screening for congenital hypothyroidism (CH). METHODS:All infants born in Colorado, USA, from July 1996 through June 2004 had a total thyroxine measured with secondary thyroid stimulating hormone determination. RESULTS:The number of first and second newborn screens completed was 494,324 and 471,877, respectively. The first screen identified 185 cases of CH (incidence of 1:2,703). The second screen identified an additional 42 cases. Overall, the incidence based on both the first and second screenings was 1:2,174. The false negative rate for the first screen was 15.6%. In the absence of a second screen, one infant with CH out of every 11,111 babies screened would have been missed. The addition of the second screen increased the cost-per-case identified from dollars 6,108 to dollars 9,730. CONCLUSIONS:With only one newborn screen for CH, the number of missed cases is significant and higher than previously reported."
7666397,"The epidemiology and genetics of microtia-anotia (M-A) were studied using data collected from the Italian Multicentre Birth Defects Registry (IPIMC) from 1983 to 1992. Among 1,173, 794 births, we identified 172 with M-A, a rate of 1.46/10,000; 38 infants (22.1%) had anotia. Of the 172 infants, 114 (66.2%) had an isolated defect, 48 (27.9%) were multiformed infants (MMI) with M-A, and 10 (5.8%) had a well defined syndrome. The frequency of bilateral defects among non-syndromic cases was 12% compared to 50% of syndromic cases (p = 0.007). Among the MMI only holoprosencephaly was preferentially associated with M-A (four cases observed upsilon 0.7 expected, p = 0.005). No significant variations were identified in the prevalence of non-syndromic cases by geographical area (range 0.62-2.37/10,000 births) or by five month time periods (range 0.21-2.58/10,000 births), nor was there evidence of time trends. When M-A cases were compared to controls, we found that mothers with parity 1 had a higher risk of giving birth to an MMI with M-A, and that mothers with chronic maternal insulin dependent diabetes were at significantly higher risk for having a child with M-A. MMI with M-A had higher rates of prematurity, low birth weight, reduced intrauterine growth, and neonatal mortality than infants with isolated M-A and controls. Babies with isolated M-A had, on average, a lower birth weight than controls; the difference was higher for females. The analysis of pedigrees and familial cases suggests an autosomal dominant trait with variable expression and incomplete penetrance in a proportion of cases, or a multifactorial aetiology. Three cases had consanguineous parents, but the absence of M-A among previous sibs does not support autosomal recessive inheritance."
11408338,"We performed a study to estimate the point prevalence of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) in the UK at national, regional and community levels. A 'Russian doll' design was used in which the population denominator for each of the three studies was successively smaller, whilst the method of case ascertainment became increasingly more rigorous. The NINDS-SPSP (National Institute of Neurological Disorders and the Society for Progressive Supranuclear Palsy) diagnostic criteria for PSP were applied throughout the study for case definition. The national study identified cases using passive referral mechanisms [e.g. the British Neurological Surveillance Unit (BNSU), PSP (Europe) Association patient register]. We identified 577 cases of PSP, giving a national prevalence estimate of 1.0 per 100 000 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.9-1.1]. The North of England regional study used active 'multiple source' case ascertainment from a collaborative network of neurologists and non-neurologists. We identified 80 cases of PSP in this study, giving a crude and age-adjusted prevalence of 3.1 (95% CI 2.4-3.8) and 2.4 (1.9-3.0) per 100 000, respectively. Of these 80 cases, 51 patients (65%) were referred initially to non-neurologists and 10 patients (13%) had not seen a neurologist at any stage of their illness. The proportion of female cases was significantly greater in the regional than in the national study (61% versus 44%; P < 0.02). Cases referred to non-neurologists were significantly older than those referred to neurologists in the regional study (median age 73 versus 69.5 years; P < 0.01). Patients in the community study were identified via diagnostic and therapeutic registers from a representative sample of general practices in Newcastle upon Tyne. We identified 17 cases of PSP, yielding crude and age-adjusted prevalences of 6.5 (95% CI 3.4-9.7) and 5.0 (95% CI 2.5-7.5) per 100 000, respectively. Seven of the 17 cases (41%) had not previously been diagnosed as PSP. This study suggests that PSP is more common than previously considered, is commonly misdiagnosed and that the majority of cases are not initially referred to neurologists. The study also confirms the importance of active and detailed case ascertainment in ensuring reliable prevalence estimates."
23606453,"Limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2L or anoctaminopathy is a condition mainly characterized by adult onset proximal lower limb muscular weakness and raised CK values, due to recessive ANO5 gene mutations. An exon 5 founder mutation (c.191dupA) has been identified in most of the British and German LGMD2L patients so far reported. We aimed to further investigate the prevalence and spectrum of ANO5 gene mutations and related clinical phenotypes, by screening 205 undiagnosed patients referred to our molecular service with a clinical suspicion of anoctaminopathy. A total of 42 unrelated patients had two ANO5 mutations (21%), whereas 14 carried a single change. We identified 34 pathogenic changes, 15 of which are novel. The c.191dupA mutation represents 61% of mutated alleles and appears to be less prevalent in non-Northern European populations. Retrospective clinical analysis corroborates the prevalently proximal lower limb phenotype, the male predominance and absence of major cardiac or respiratory involvement. Identification of cases with isolated hyperCKaemia and very late symptomatic male and female subjects confirms the extension of the phenotypic spectrum of the disease. Anoctaminopathy appears to be one of the most common adult muscular dystrophies in Northern Europe, with a prevalence of about 20%-25% in unselected undiagnosed cases."
17417720,"Carnitine transporter deficiency (CTD) and holocarboxylase synthetase deficiency (HLCSD) are frequent in The Faroe Islands compared to other areas, and treatment is available for both disorders. In order to evaluate the feasibility of neonatal screening in The Faroe Islands we studied detection in the neonatal period by tandem mass spectrometry, carrier frequencies, clinical manifestations, and effect of treatment of CTD and HLCSD. We found 11 patients with CTD from five families and 8 patients with HLCSD from five families. The natural history of both disorders varied extensively among patients, ranging from patients who presumably had died from their disease to asymptomatic individuals. All symptomatic patients responded favourably to supplementation with L: -carnitine (in case of CTD) or biotin (in case of HLCSD), but only if treated early. Estimates of carrier frequency of about 1:20 for both disorders indicate that some enzyme-deficient individuals remain undiagnosed. Prospective and retrospective tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analyses of carnitines from neonatally obtained filter-paper dried blood-spot samples (DBSS) uncovered 8 of 10 individuals with CTD when using both C(0) and C(2) as markers (current algorithm) and 10 of 10 when using only C(0) as marker. MS/MS analysis uncovered 5 of 6 patient with HLCSD. This is the first study to report successful neonatal MS/MS analysis for the diagnosis of HLCSD. We conclude that CTD and HLCSD are relatively frequent in The Faroe Islands and are associated with variable clinical manifestations, and that diagnosis by neonatal screening followed by early therapy will secure a good outcome."
16236739,"BACKGROUND: Acute lung injury is a critical illness syndrome consisting of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure with bilateral pulmonary infiltrates that are not attributed to left atrial hypertension. Despite recent advances in our understanding of the mechanism and treatment of acute lung injury, its incidence and outcomes in the United States have been unclear. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, population-based, cohort study in 21 hospitals in and around King County, Washington, from April 1999 through July 2000, using a validated screening protocol to identify patients who met the consensus criteria for acute lung injury. RESULTS: A total of 1113 King County residents undergoing mechanical ventilation met the criteria for acute lung injury and were 15 years of age or older. On the basis of this figure, the crude incidence of acute lung injury was 78.9 per 100,000 person-years and the age-adjusted incidence was 86.2 per 100,000 person-years. The in-hospital mortality rate was 38.5 percent. The incidence of acute lung injury increased with age from 16 per 100,000 person-years for those 15 through 19 years of age to 306 per 100,000 person-years for those 75 through 84 years of age. Mortality increased with age from 24 percent for patients 15 through 19 years of age to 60 percent for patients 85 years of age or older (P<0.001). We estimate that each year in the United States there are 190,600 cases of acute lung injury, which are associated with 74,500 deaths and 3.6 million hospital days. CONCLUSIONS: Acute lung injury has a substantial impact on public health, with an incidence in the United States that is considerably higher than previous reports have suggested."
22933095,"BACKGROUND: The epidemiology of congenital small intestinal atresia (SIA) has not been well studied. This study describes the presence of additional anomalies, pregnancy outcomes, total prevalence and association with maternal age in SIA cases in Europe. METHODS: Cases of SIA delivered during January 1990 to December 2006 notified to 20 EUROCAT registers formed the population-based case series. Prevalence over time was estimated using multilevel Poisson regression, and heterogeneity between registers was evaluated from the random component of the intercept. RESULTS: In total 1133 SIA cases were reported among 5126, 164 registered births. Of 1044 singleton cases, 215 (20.6%) cases were associated with a chromosomal anomaly. Of 829 singleton SIA cases with normal karyotype, 221 (26.7%) were associated with other structural anomalies. Considering cases with normal karyotype, the total prevalence per 10 000 births was 1.6 (95% CI 1.5 to 1.7) for SIA, 0.9 (95% CI 0.8 to 1.0) for duodenal atresia and 0.7 (95% CI 0.7 to 0.8) for jejunoileal atresia (JIA). There was no significant trend in SIA, duodenal atresia or JIA prevalence over time (RR=1.0, 95% credible interval (CrI): 1.0 to 1.0 for each), but SIA and duodenal atresia prevalence varied by geographical location (p=0.03 and p=0.04, respectively). There was weak evidence of an increased risk of SIA in mothers aged less than 20 years compared with mothers aged 20 to 29 years (RR=1.3, 95% CrI: 1.0 to 1.8). CONCLUSION: This study found no evidence of a temporal trend in the prevalence of SIA, duodenal atresia or JIA, although SIA and duodenal atresia prevalence varied significantly between registers."
22872100,"The clinical understanding of the CDKL5 disorder remains limited, with most information being derived from small patient groups seen at individual centres. This study uses a large international data collection to describe the clinical profile of the CDKL5 disorder and compare with Rett syndrome (RTT). Information on individuals with cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5) mutations (n=86) and females with MECP2 mutations (n=920) was sourced from the InterRett database. Available photographs of CDKL5 patients were examined for dysmorphic features. The proportion of CDKL5 patients meeting the recent Neul criteria for atypical RTT was determined. Logistic regression and time-to-event analyses were used to compare the occurrence of Rett-like features in those with MECP2 and CDKL5 mutations. Most individuals with CDKL5 mutations had severe developmental delay from birth, seizure onset before the age of 3 months and similar non-dysmorphic features. Less than one-quarter met the criteria for early-onset seizure variant RTT. Seizures and sleep disturbances were more common than in those with MECP2 mutations whereas features of regression and spinal curvature were less common. The CDKL5 disorder presents with a distinct clinical profile and a subtle facial, limb and hand phenotype that may assist in differentiation from other early-onset encephalopathies. Although mutations in the CDKL5 gene have been described in association with the early-onset variant of RTT, in our study the majority did not meet these criteria. Therefore, the CDKL5 disorder should be considered separate to RTT, rather than another variant."
17987642,"ECLAMC: Latin American Study of Congenital Malformations examined 4,157,224 births (1967-2000), detecting 370 newborns with suspected holoprosencephaly (HPE): 182 (49.2%) had only craniofacial defects; 99 (26.8%) had defects in other systems; (15.1%) had chromosomal anomalies; 5 (1.4%) had recognized syndromes; and 28 (7.6%) had isolated median cleft lip. The latter group was excluded from subsequent analyses because of epidemiological differences from the other groups. The birth prevalence rate (BPR) of isolated HPE was homogeneous among the 11 sampled countries, increasing from 0.5/10,000 births to 1/10,000 births between 1967 and 2000, suggesting improved ascertainment, mainly after 1996. Microtia, cleft lip/palate, and microstomia were preferentially associated with HPE, but cleft palate only was not. Maternal diabetes was more prevalent in HPE than in controls when adding the isolated and associated groups (OR: 3.5; 95% CI: 0.9-16.2). Maternal flu was more prevalent in isolated HPE (OR: 3.6; 0.9-16.6) and in isolated plus associated HPE (OR: 2.8; 1.0-7.9) than in controls. A second series of better documented HPE cases, 179 in number (2.2/10,000), ascertained from 827,968 births occurring from 2000 to 2003, was used for phenotypic definition of cerebral and facial anomalies. In 83 of 174 HPE cases with specified cerebral defects, 40% were alobar, 43% were semilobar, and 17% were lobar. All cases of cyclopia, ethmocephaly, and cebocephaly were of the alobar or semilobar types. Female excess occurred in the total sample, but not within the subgroups themselves because of their small sample sizes. Neither alobar HPE nor cyclopia was associated with female predilection. Among the 174 HPE cases, 39% had neither oral clefting nor a severe dysmorphic face. Of facial phenotypes, 26% had cyclopia, ethmocephaly, or cebocephaly; 25% had premaxillary agenesis; and 10% had cleft lip and palate or cleft palate only. Cyclopia was not associated with oral clefts; 6 of 8 cases of ethmocephaly had cleft palate; 6 of 20 cases of cebocephaly had oral clefts; 4 of 20 cases had premaxillary agenesis; and 2 of 20 cases had cleft palate."
9258750,"A four-generation kindred (14 affected and 10 unaffected members) from Missouri, U.S.A. in which spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia (SEMD) had been inherited as an autosomal dominant disorder was investigated for linkage to 13 candidate loci: COL2AI, COL9AI, COL9A2, COL9A3, COL10A1, COL11A1, COL11A2, PSACH, FGFR3, decorin, CRTL1, COMP, and PTHRP. Mutations of COL2A1, COL9A2, COL10, and FGFR3 have been reported previously in the Strudwick type of SEMD, multiple epiphyseal dysplasia type 2 (EDM2), the Schmid type of metaphyseal dysplasia, and in achondroplasia, respectively, and the pseudoachondroplasia (PSACH) locus has been mapped to chromosome 19p12. In addition, mutations in COL9 and COL11A are associated with murine forms of degenerative joint disease and chondroplasia, respectively. The family proved informative for 12 of the 13 loci and was uninformative at the decorin locus. Linkage between this form of SEMD, designated the Missouri variant, SEMDMO, and the 12 informative candidate loci was excluded (LOD scores < -2.00 at theta = 0.005 to 0.15), thereby indicating further genetic heterogeneity in these inherited disorders of bone and cartilage development."
21500339,"Noonan syndrome (NS), Costello syndrome (CS), cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome (CFCS), and LEOPARD syndrome (now also referred to as Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines or NSML) are clinically overlapping dominant disorders that are caused by mutations in RAS signaling pathway genes. The spectrum of cancer susceptibility in this group of disorders has not been studied in detail. We identified more than 1900 cases of NS, CS, CFCS, or NSML reported in the literature between 1937 and 2010; 88 cancers were reported. The most common cancers reported in 1051 NS subjects were neuroblastoma (n = 8), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 8), low grade glioma (n = 6), and rhabdomyosarcoma (n = 6). These associations are biologically plausible, given that somatic RAS pathway mutations are known to occur in these specific cancers. In addition, 40 childhood cases of myeloproliferative disease were described in individuals with NS, several of whom experienced a benign course of this hematologic condition. We confirmed the previously described association between CS and cancer in 268 reported individuals: 19 had rhabdomyosarcoma, 4 had bladder cancer, and 5 had neuroblastoma. By age 20, the cumulative incidence of cancer was approximately 4% for NS and 15% for CS; both syndromes had a cancer incidence peak in childhood. The cancers described in CFCS and NSML overlapped with those reported in NS and CS. Future epidemiologic studies will be required to confirm the described cancer spectrum and to estimate precise cancer risks."
8645957,"To estimate the prevalence of chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) in Sweden, an inquiry asking for known and possible CGD cases was mailed to paediatric, internal medicine and infectious disease departments all over Sweden. The detected patients were characterized as to genetics and the clinical presentation. Twenty-one patients (belonging to 16 different families) were found, corresponding to a prevalence of approximately 1/450,000 individuals. The patients with X-linked disease, lacking a functional gp91phox protein (n = 12), comprised 57% and 43% of the patients had an autosomal recessive (AR) disease lacking p47phox (n = 7) or p67phox (n = 1), respectively. All unrelated patients with X-linked disease displayed different gene abnormalities such as point mutations predicting nonsense (n = 3), missense (n = 1) or splice site mutations (n = 2), but also a total deletion and a unique 40 base pair duplicature insertion. The patients with p47phox-deficiency showed a GT deletion at a GTGT tandem repeat, and the p67phox-deficient patient displayed a heterozygous in-frame deletion of AAG combined with a large deletion in the other allele. Three patients died during the study period, two from pseudomonas cepacia infections. Patients with X-linked disease had more frequent infections (mean of 1.7 per year), than the patients with AR inheritance (0.5 infections per year). The most common infections were dermal abscesses (n = 111), followed by lymphadenitis (n = 82) and pneumonias (n = 73). Inflammatory bowel disease-like symptoms, mimicking Crohn's disease of the colon, was seen in three CGD patients."
22991292,"Leukodystrophies (LD) and lysosomal storage disorders (LSD) have generated increased interest recently as targets for newborn screening programs. Accurate epidemiological benchmarks are needed in the U.S. Age-specific mortality rates were estimated for Krabbe disease (KD) and nine related disorders. U.S. mortality records with E75.2 cause of death code during 1999-2004 were collected from 11 open record states. All E75.2 deaths in the United States were distributed into specific disease type based on proportions observed in these states. Yearly population sizes were obtained from the CDC and averaged. Mortality rates (per million individuals per year) by age group for the specific diseases were (for <5 or ≥5 years): Pelizaeus-Merzbacher (0.037/0.033); sudanophilic leukodystrophy (SLD) (0.037/0.004); Canavan (0.037/0.011), Alexander (0.147/0.022); Krabbe (0.994/0.007); metachromatic leukodystrophy (0.331/0.135); Fabry (0.000/0.124); Gaucher (0.221/0.073); Niemann-Pick (NP) (0.442/0.088); multiple sulfatase (0.000/0.004). This is the first report of mortality rates for the LD/LSD diseases in the U.S. Approximated birth prevalence rate for the early infantile Krabbe phenotype (onset 0-6 months) was based on the <5 year old mortality rate of one early infantile case per 244,000 births, which matches the 1 in 250,000 observed in the NYS newborn screening program as of 2011. It should be noted however that the NYS calculation refers only to the early infantile phenotype and does not include the majority of babies identified in the program with low GALC and two mutations who have remained clinically normal. It is presumed that most, if not all, will develop later onset forms of the disease, but this is by no means certain."
18799060,"To determine the incidence and clinical presentation of Wegener's granulomatosis (WG) in Finland during the 20-year period 1981-2000.We performed a study with retrospective data retrieval using the hospital discharge register in Finland. All available hospital case reports were reviewed. We included those patients diagnosed with and treated for WG. Demographic and clinical data at diagnosis were recorded.Of the 492 patients diagnosed with WG, 49% were male. Mean age at diagnosis was 53.2 years (SD 18.1). The highest rate of incidence occurred in men and women aged 65-74 years. The annual incidence per million of the population increased from 1.9 (95% CI 1.4 to 2.6) during 1981-1985 to 9.3 (95% CI 8.1 to 10.6) during 1996-2000 with gender age-adjusted incidence rate ratio 4.5 (CI 3.6 to 5.7). Only minor changes in the signs and symptoms at diagnosis occurred during the 20-year span. In 83% of cases, the ACR criteria (>or=2 criteria) were fulfilled. The mean age at diagnosis rose from 45.8 to 55.0 years and the median diagnostic delay decreased from 17 to 4 months during the two decades.The incidence of WG has increased during the last two decades with little change in clinical symptoms at presentation. At the same time, the mean age of the patients has increased and the diagnostic delay has considerably shortened."
8242961,"Seventeen patients with symptomatic cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) were diagnosed between 1980 and 1990 in the Leeward Islands of the Netherlands Antilles. Five patients had multiple AVMs. The annual incidence of symptomatic AVMs was 1.1/100,000. The mean age of presentation was 35 years. In 6 patients cerebral AVMs were associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT); 4 of these patients had multiple AVMs. We conclude that HHT is frequently encountered in Netherlands Antillians with symptomatic and multiple cerebral AVMs."
6187153,"Between 1969 and 1978, 44 pemphigus (p.) patients were treated in Finnish hospitals. The number of new cases was 36, giving an annual incidence of 0.76 cases per million inhabitants. The male/female ratio was 0.9:1. Nine patients had p. vulgaris (p.vu.); one p. vegetans (p.ve.); 9, p. foliaceus (p.fo.); 22, p. erythematodes (p.er.); and 3, p.NUD (p.NUD). One patient with p.er. also had myasthenia gravis. The mean age at onset was 57 1/2 years. The disease started in the mouth only in p.vu. (78% of cases) and in p.NUD (67%). Prednisone (or its derivatives) was most commonly used for systemic treatment, the mean initial dose being 61.4 mg/day. P.vu. and p.NUD required higher initial doses of prednisone and a longer duration of the high-dose treatment. The smallest mean daily dose of prednisone required to achieve a remission of at least 6 months was 5.2 mg. The mean duration of remission was 30 1/2 months. The frequency of side effects of systemic drug therapy was low (18%), possibly because only comparatively low doses of prednisone were used in Finland. The cause of death in 3 (6.8%) out of 44 patients was attributable either to p. itself or to its treatment. The mean annual number of hospitalization days for the whole material was 16.4 days and the mean annual number of hospital admissions 0.7."
12189489,"Propionic acidemia [MIM 606054] is a form of organic acidemia caused by genetic deficiency of propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC) and characterized by attacks of severe metabolic acidemia and hyperammonemia beginning in the neonatal period or in early infancy. There are, however, patients who have higher PCC activities and present later with unusual symptoms, such as mild mental retardation or extrapyramidal symptoms, sometimes even without metabolic acidosis. Through the neonatal screening of more than 130,000 Japanese newborns we detected a frequency of patients with propionic acidemia more than ten times higher than previously reported, most of them with milder phenotypes. The mutational spectrum was quite different from that of patients with the severe form and there was a common mutation (Y435C) in the beta subunit of the PCC gene (PCCB). Since patients with the mild form could present with unusual symptoms and therefore could easily remain unrecognized, it is important to identify those patients and clarify their natural history. Molecularly, one of the mutations (A1288C) caused an unusual pattern of multiple exon skipping and another unidentified mutation lead to the absence of mRNA. Taking into consideration previous findings regarding PCCB mutations, it appears that this gene is particularly prone to posttranscriptional modifications such as missense mediated exon skipping, mRNA decay, or rapid product degradation."
21659675,"INTRODUCTION:PKU is a metabolic disorder caused by a mutation in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene. Icelandic neonatal screening for PKU started in 1972. The mutation causes a variable [corrected] dysfunction in PAH, that metabolizes phenylalanine (Phe) to tyrosine (Tyr) with the cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4). Accumulation of Phe causes mental retardation and seizures. Current therapy focuses on Phe-restrictive diet and newer methods like BH4 in large doses. The primary aim was to collect data about PKU in Iceland and evaluate therapy and screening. Additional focus was on BH4 therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS:Information was gathered from Landspitali medical charts retrospectively. Serum-Phe (S-Phe) measurements, age at initiation of therapy, PAH mutation types and information on current therapy was collected. RESULTS from BH4 loading tests were collected. RESULTS:27 patients have been diagnosed with PKU in Iceland since 1947. Incidence 1972-2008 is 1/8400 living births. Classic PKU is the most common presentation in Iceland. Patients diagnosed after screening started have normal intelligence. Age at initiation of therapy and S-Phe average values lower with time. 12 PAH mutation types have been found in Iceland. A novel Icelandic mutation, Y377fsdelT, did not respond to BH4 loading test. Two patients responded to a BH4 loading test and four other patients are likely to respond to BH4 loading test. CONCLUSION:PKU incidence in Iceland is slightly higher than in neighboring countries. Therapy compliance is adequate and international consensuses regarding therapy are met. PKU patients in Iceland are generally in good health. Screening is efficient and save. BH4 therapy is a an optional alternative therapy in Iceland."
23079473,"Sarcomas are a heterogeneous group of malignant neoplasms arising from mesenchymal cells which encompass dozens of histological types and can occur in virtually any anatomic site. They form one of the principal groups of rare cancers in Europe as defined in the RARECARE project. We analysed 45,568 incident cases diagnosed during 1995-2002 and registered by 76 population-based cancer registries. Total crude incidence was 5.6 per 100,000 per year with an estimated 27,908 new cases per year in the EU27 countries, of which 84% were soft tissue sarcomas and 14% were bone sarcomas. Gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) were only widely recognised as an entity in the late 1990s and consequently were under-registered. Their true incidence is believed to be about 1.5 per 100,000. Age-standardised incidence of soft tissue sarcomas ranged from 3.3 per 100,000 in Eastern Europe to 4.7 per 100,000 in Northern Europe. About 280,000 persons were estimated to be alive at the beginning of 2003 with a past diagnosis of sarcoma, of which 83% were soft tissue sarcomas and 16% were bone sarcomas. Five-year relative survival for 2000-2002 by the period was 58% for soft tissue sarcomas and 62% for bone sarcomas. The diversity and rarity of sarcomas combined with the quite large number of people affected by them mean that they provide a classic example of the importance of networking in diagnosis, therapy and research for rare cancers."
22245904,"OBJECTIVE: Studies on the epidemiology of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) show variable outcome. We aimed at systematically reviewing the incidence and prevalence rates, as well as geographical distribution and temporal trends of PSC and PBC. DATA SOURCES: A systematic search of literature was performed in Medline and EMBASE (search last conducted January 10th, 2011). STUDY SELECTION: Population-based epidemiological studies reporting incidence and/or prevalence rates for PSC or PBC in a defined geographical area of at least 100,000 adult inhabitants were considered relevant. DATA EXTRACTION: Study area, study period, number of patients, number of inhabitants, incidence per 100,000 inhabitants per year, prevalence per 100,000 inhabitants, method of case-finding, method of case-ascertainment, male/female ratio and in case of PSC, occurrence of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) were extracted from retrieved articles. RESULTS: The literature search yielded 2286 abstracts of which 31 articles fulfilled all inclusion criteria. Studies varied in size from 10 to 770 patients in catchment areas from 100,312 to 19,230,000 inhabitants. The incidence and prevalence rates for PSC range from 0 to 1.3 per 100,000 inhabitants/year and 0-16.2 per 100,000 inhabitants, respectively. PBC incidence rates range from 0.33 to 5.8 per 100,000 inhabitants/year and prevalence rates range from 1.91 to 40.2 per 100,000 inhabitants; prevalence rates are increasing in time. CONCLUSIONS: Incidence and prevalence rates of both PSC and PBC vary widely and seem to be increasing. True population-based studies are scarce and therefore large population-based studies combining meticulous case-finding and case-ascertainment strategies are necessary."
23148499,"BACKGROUND: Amyloidosis is a heterogeneous disease caused by deposition of amyloid fibrils in organs and thereby interfering with physiological functions. Hardly any incidence data are available and most survival data are limited to specialist clinics. METHODS: Amyloidosis patients were identified from the Swedish Hospital Discharge and Outpatients Registers from years 2001 through 2008. RESULTS: The incidence of non-hereditary amyloidosis in 949 patients was 8.29 per million person-years and the diagnostic age with the highest incidence was over 65 years. Secondary systemic amyloidosis showed an incidence of 1 per million and a female excess and the largest number of subsequent rheumatoid arthritis deaths; the median survival was 4 years. However, as rheumatoid arthritis deaths also occurred in other diagnostic subtypes, the incidence of secondary systemic amyloidosis was likely to be about 2.0 per million. The median survival of patients with organ-limited amyloidosis was 6 years. Most myeloma deaths occurred in patients diagnosed with unspecified or 'other' amyloidosis. These subtypes probably accounted for most of immunoglobulin light chain (AL) amyloidosis cases; the median survival time was 3 years. CONCLUSIONS: The present diagnostic categorization cannot single out AL amyloidosis in the Swedish discharge data but, by extrapolation from myeloma cases, an incidence of 3.2 per million could be ascribed to AL amyloidosis. Similarly, based on rheumatoid arthritis death rates, an incidence of 2.0 could be ascribed to secondary systemic amyloidosis."
25687144,"To estimate prevalence of childhood-onset Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies (DBMD) in 6 sites in the United States by race/ethnicity and phenotype (Duchenne muscular dystrophy [DMD] or Becker muscular dystrophy [BMD]).In 2002, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention established the Muscular Dystrophy Surveillance, Tracking, and Research Network (MD STARnet) to conduct longitudinal, population-based surveillance and research of DBMD in the United States. Six sites conducted active, multiple-source case finding and record abstraction to identify MD STARnet cases born January 1982 to December 2011. We used cross-sectional analyses to estimate prevalence of DBMD per 10 000 boys, ages 5 to 9 years, for 4 quinquennia (1991-1995, 1996-2000, 2001-2005, and 2006-2010) and prevalence per 10 000 male individuals, ages 5 to 24 years, in 2010. Prevalence was also estimated by race/ethnicity and phenotype.Overall, 649 cases resided in an MD STARnet site during ≥1 quinquennia. Prevalence estimates per 10 000 boys, ages 5 to 9 years, were 1.93, 2.05, 2.04, and 1.51, respectively, for 1991-1995, 1996-2000, 2001-2005, and 2006-2010. Prevalence tended to be higher for Hispanic individuals than non-Hispanic white or black individuals, and higher for DMD than BMD. In 2010, prevalence of DBMD was 1.38 per 10 000 male individuals, ages 5 to 24 years.We present population-based prevalence estimates for DBMD in 6 US sites. Prevalence differed by race/ethnicity, suggesting potential cultural and socioeconomic influences in the diagnosis of DBMD. Prevalence also was higher for DMD than BMD. Continued longitudinal surveillance will permit us to examine racial/ethnic and socioeconomic differences in treatment and outcomes for MD STARnet cases."
21793646,"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) in the US is largely unknown. Prior research has estimated PAH prevalence in Europe at ∼15-52 per million. METHODS: Using a privately insured claims database (1999-2007) for the under age 65 population and a Medicare claims database for the 65+ population, and following the current clinical classification of PH, CTEPH patients were identified as having: ≥2 claims for pulmonary hypertension (PH) [ICD-9-CM: 416.0, 416.8]; ≥1 claim for pulmonary embolism (PE) ≤12 months prior or 1 month after the initial PH claim (index date). PAH patients were identified: ≥2 claims for primary PH [416.0]; no left heart disease, lung diseases, CTEPH, or miscellaneous PH diagnoses ≤12 months prior or 1 month after the index date. Both cohorts were required to have ≥1 claim for right heart catheterization ≤6 months prior to any PH claim, or ≥1 claim for echocardiogram ≤6 months prior to a specialist-diagnosed PH claim. Age- and gender-standardized prevalence rates per million individuals (PMI) were calculated using appropriate population weights. RESULTS: Prevalence rates (95% CI) of CTEPH were estimated at 63 (34-91) PMI among the privately insured (<65), and 1007 (904-1111) PMI among the Medicare population (≥65). The corresponding estimates for PAH were 109 (71-146) PMI among the <65 population, and 451 (384-519) PMI for Medicare. LIMITATIONS: Identification of PAH and CTEPH patients in administrative claims data is challenging, due to lack of specific ICD-9-CM codes for the conditions and risk of misdiagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence rates of CTEPH and PAH increase with age, and are higher among women. The increased risk of PE may explain the sharp age gradient for CTEPH prevalence. The estimated US prevalence of PAH is higher than existing estimates."
15272223,"We investigated the prevalence of multiple system atrophy (MSA) in Gironde, France, through a network of 120 public and private specialists and assessed the relationship between some environmental factors and MSA in a case-control study involving 50 MSA patients, 50 Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and 50 healthy controls. The occupational exposure to pesticides was evaluated through a job-exposure matrix. On prevalence day (November 1, 1998), the crude prevalence of MSA in Gironde was 1.94/100,000 inhabitants. We found no significant relationship between occupational exposure to pesticides and MSA. PD patients were significantly less frequently ever-smokers than controls and the same tendency was observed for MSA patients. We also described the clinical features that heralded the disease among this nonselected population."
25500707,"Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease (KFD) is a rare cause of lymphadenopathy, most often cervical. It has been mainly described in Asia. There are few data available on this disease in Europe. We conducted this retrospective, observational, multicenter study to describe KFD in France and to determine the characteristics of severe forms of the disease and forms associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We included 91 cases of KFD, diagnosed between January 1989 and January 2011 in 13 French hospital centers (median age, 30 ± 10.4 yr; 77% female). The ethnic origins of the patients were European (33%), Afro-Caribbean (32%), North African (15.4%), and Asian (13%). Eighteen patients had a history of systemic disease, including 11 with SLE. Lymph node involvement was cervical (90%), often in the context of polyadenopathy (52%), and it was associated with hepatomegaly and splenomegaly in 14.8% of cases. Deeper sites of involvement were noted in 18% of cases. Constitutional signs consisted mainly of fever (67%), asthenia (74.4%), and weight loss (51.2%). Other manifestations included skin rash (32.9%), arthromyalgia (34.1%), 2 cases of aseptic meningitis, and 3 cases of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Biological signs included lymphocytopenia (63.8%) and increase of acute phase reactants (56.4%). Antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) and anti-DNA antibodies were present in 45.2% and 18% of the patients sampled, respectively. Concomitant viral infection was detected in 8 patients (8.8%). Systemic corticosteroids were prescribed in 32% of cases, hydroxychloroquine in 17.6%, and intravenous immunoglobulin in 3 patients. The disease course was always favorable. Recurrence was observed in 21% of cases. In the 33 patients with ANA at diagnosis, SLE was known in 11 patients, diagnosed concomitantly in 10 cases and in the year following diagnosis in 2 cases; 6 patients did not have SLE, and 4 patients were lost to follow-up (median follow-up, 19 mo; range, 3-39 mo). The presence of weight loss, arthralgia, skin lesions, and ANA was associated with the development of SLE (p < 0.05). Male sex and lymphopenia were associated with severe forms of KFD (p < 0.05). KFD can occur in all populations, irrespective of ethnic origin. Deep forms are common. An association with SLE should be investigated. A prospective study is required to determine the risk factors for the development of SLE."
25211237,"BACKGROUND: Wolfram syndrome (WFS) is a recessive neurologic and endocrinologic degenerative disorder, and is also known as DIDMOAD (Diabetes Insipidus, early-onset Diabetes Mellitus, progressive Optic Atrophy and Deafness) syndrome. Most affected individuals carry recessive mutations in the Wolfram syndrome 1 gene (WFS1). However, the phenotypic pleiomorphism, rarity and molecular complexity of this disease complicate our efforts to understand WFS. To address this limitation, we aimed to describe complications and to elucidate the contributions of WFS1 mutations to clinical manifestations in Japanese patients with WFS. METHODOLOGY: The minimal ascertainment criterion for diagnosing WFS was having both early onset diabetes mellitus and bilateral optic atrophy. Genetic analysis for WFS1 was performed by direct sequencing. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Sixty-seven patients were identified nationally for a prevalence of one per 710,000, with 33 patients (49%) having all 4 components of DIDMOAD. In 40 subjects who agreed to participate in this investigation from 30 unrelated families, the earliest manifestation was DM at a median age of 8.7 years, followed by OA at a median age of 15.8 years. However, either OA or DI was the first diagnosed feature in 6 subjects. In 10, features other than DM predated OA. Twenty-seven patients (67.5%) had a broad spectrum of recessive mutations in WFS1. Two patients had mutations in only one allele. Eleven patients (27.5%) had intact WFS1 alleles. Ages at onset of both DM and OA in patients with recessive WFS1 mutations were indistinguishable from those in patients without WFS1 mutations. In the patients with predicted complete loss-of-function mutations, ages at the onsets of both DM and OA were significantly earlier than those in patients with predicted partial-loss-of function mutations. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: This study emphasizes the clinical and genetic heterogeneity in patients with WFS. Genotype-phenotype correlations may exist in patients with WFS1 mutations, as demonstrated by the disease onset."
3762972,"The incidence, prevalence, and mortality rates of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in southwestern Ontario, Canada, were determined for the years 1978 through 1982. The average annual incidence rate was 1.63 per 100,000 population. The prevalence rate was 4.9 per 100,000 on January 1, 1983. The average annual mortality rate was 1.52 per 100,000 population and increased with age, reaching a peak in the 70 to 79-year decade in both sexes. The male:female ratio was 1.2:1. The average age at diagnosis was 62.5 years, and the average duration from date of diagnosis was 2.5 years. The distribution of the disease was uneven in 12 counties, with the highest incidence in Perth (3.33) and Essex (2.43) counties. The city of Windsor, in an industrial region, had a high average annual incidence rate of 2.81."
21517799,"BACKGROUND: Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is an external manifestation of coeliac disease presenting with blistering rash and pathognomonic cutaneous IgA deposits. Better knowledge of subclinical forms and serological testing has resulted in a sharp increase in the incidence and prevalence of coeliac disease. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prevalence of DH and analyse whether the incidence of DH changed when the occurrence of coeliac disease increased. METHODS: All 477 patients with DH diagnosed from 1970 onwards at the Tampere University Hospital were analysed for prevalence in 2009. The incidence of DH was calculated in three 10-year periods from the year 1980. RESULTS: The prevalence of DH was 75·3 per 100,000 which is eight times lower than the prevalence of coeliac disease in our area. The annual incidence of DH in the whole period was 3·5 per 100,000, and in the three 10-year periods 5·2, 2·9 and 2·7 per 100,000, respectively. The decrease in incidence between the first and second 10-year period was significant (P<0·001). The male to female ratio of DH was 1·1:1. The mean age at diagnosis increased significantly during the study, in men from 35·3 to 51·1 years and in women from 36·3 to 45·8 years. CONCLUSIONS: The present study shows the highest prevalence of DH reported to date. Although the overall incidence of DH was also high, a significant decrease occurred in the 1990s, which is in contrast to the incidence of coeliac disease."
11135356,"BACKGROUND:Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) is a unique chronic B cell lymphoproliferative disease (B-LPD), with distinct clinical and pathological features, and excellent treatment response to 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (2-CDA) and pentostatin. There have been few reports of HCL from oriental countries. PATIENTS AND METHODS:A retrospective survey of HCL in six major hematology units in Hong Kong over a 12-year period. RESULTS:There were 18 cases of HCL identified. Most patients presented with fever, splenomegaly and monocytopenia. Lymphadenopathy was present in three patients, and open biopsy revealed tuberculosis infection in two cases. Seven cases received interferon and 12 cases received 2-CDA. Four patients died from bronchogenic carcinoma, cerebral vascular accident, fulminant hepatitis B virus reactivation and malignant melanoma. The remaining 14 patients are in clinical remission at a median of 6 years' follow-up; two are also surviving from second malignancies (thyroid papillary carcinoma and renal cell carcinoma). CONCLUSIONS:Parallel to the low incidence of B-LPD in Chinese, the incidence of HCL (0.035/100000 population per year) is much lower than in Western series. Other clinical features such as male dominance, clinical presentation, response to 2-CDA treatment, and association with second malignancy are similar to Western reports. However, two common complications in the Chinese population are the fulminant reactivation of hepatitis B infection and disseminated tuberculosis infection."
11731654,"OBJECTIVE:To evaluate whether congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) patients can be detected by newborn screening before the occurrence of life-threatening salt wasting and whether the prevalence, specificity, and sensitivity are adequate enough for a routine screening procedure. DESIGN:From 1998, a 2-year regional pilot screening for CAH was performed. In 1998, cutoff levels for 17OHP were primarily based on birth weight, and in 1999 on gestational age. In addition, nationwide, all newly diagnosed patients with CAH were reported to the Dutch Pediatric Surveillance Unit to compare screened CAH patients with CAH patients in the area without screening. RESULTS:In 2 years, 176 684 newborns were screened and 15 CAH patients (7 males/8 females) were detected. Therapy was started at the median age of 7 days. In the area without screening, 223 307 infants were born and 19 CAH patients (10 males/9 females) were reported to the Dutch Pediatric Surveillance Unit. Therapy was started at the median age of 14 days. The mean (standard deviation) serum sodium concentration was 134.5 (3.4) mmol/L in the area of screening versus 124.5 (10.8) mmol/L in the area without screening. The overall prevalence was 1:11 764. In 1998 and 1999, the specificity was 99.76% and 99.97%, respectively. The positive predictive value was 4.5% and 16%, respectively. To date, no false-negative cases have been detected. CONCLUSION:Severe salt wasting can be prevented by neonatal screening. The prevalence, specificity, and sensitivity allowed addition of screening for CAH to the routinely performed national neonatal screening program."
16114783,"AIM:The aim of the present investigation is to study the epidemiology of Alport syndrome in southern Sweden, to search for mutations in the COL4A5 gene and to estimate the mutation frequency. PATIENTS AND METHODS:Patients with suspected Alport syndrome were identified in an area with a population of 1.45 million. Clinical criteria were used to establish the diagnosis and samples for mutation analysis were collected. Mutation analyses were performed with Single-Stranded Conformation Polymorphism analysis (SSCP) of PCR-amplified genomic DNA. RESULTS:Altogether 25 families with hereditary nephritis were identified. Alport syndrome with X-linked transmission was evident in 14 families, with juvenile (< 31 years) progression to end-stage renal failure (ESRF) in ten, and adult (> or = 31 years) in four families. CONCLUSION:The frequency of males with X-linked disease was calculated to one in 17,000 male births (95% confidence interval (CI) 1/10,500-1/28,600), and the prevalence to one in 40,000. A total of seven females with ESRF were identified, with a median age at ESRF of 45 years. The male to female ratio of cases with ESRF was 4.9 to 1. The risk of developing ESRF among females was from the expected incidence roughly estimated to 12%. Patients with X-linked disease constituted 1.8% of patients with ESRF in the examined area. A mutation was identified positive in 10 of 14 families with X-linked disease, but never in families not fulfilling the clinical criteria for Alport syndrome. In families with juvenile phenotype and positive mutation analysis, the mutation frequency was calculated to between 1/78,000 and 1/198,000 (95% CI 1/42,000-1/177,000) if the effective fertility was estimated to be between 0 and 0.2."
25122204,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence and prevalence of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) in the Netherlands. METHODS: Using 3-source capture-recapture methodology, we estimated the total yearly number of newly found symptomatic individuals with FSHD, including those not registered in any of the 3 sources. To this end, symptomatic individuals with FSHD were available from 3 large population-based registries in the Netherlands if diagnosed within a 10-year period (January 1, 2001 to December 31, 2010). Multiplication of the incidence and disease duration delivered the prevalence estimate. RESULTS: On average, 52 people are newly diagnosed with FSHD every year. This results in an incidence rate of 0.3/100,000 person-years in the Netherlands. The prevalence rate was 12/100,000, equivalent to 2,000 affected individuals. CONCLUSIONS: We present population-based incidence and prevalence estimates regarding symptomatic individuals with FSHD, including an estimation of the number of symptomatic individuals not present in any of the 3 used registries. This study shows that the total number of symptomatic persons with FSHD in the population may well be underestimated and a considerable number of affected individuals remain undiagnosed. This suggests that FSHD is one of the most prevalent neuromuscular disorders."
23216361,"INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to assess population-based changes in incidence, treatment, and in short- and long-term survival of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) over 23 years. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Analysis of all patients in Iceland who fulfilled the consensus criteria for ARDS in 1988-2010. Demographic variables, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) scores and ventilation parameters were collected from hospital charts. RESULTS: The age-standardised incidence of ARDS during the study period was 7.2 cases per 100,000 person-years and was increased by 0.2 cases per year (P < 0.001). The most common causes of ARDS were pneumonia (29%) and sepsis (29%). The use of pressure-controlled ventilation became almost dominant from 1993. The peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) has significantly decreased (-0.5 cmH(2) O/year), but the peak end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) has increased (0.1 cmH(2) O/year) during the study period. The hospital mortality decreased by 1% per year (P = 0.03) during the study period, from 50% in 1988-1992 to 33% in 2006-2010. A multivariable logistic regression model revealed that higher age and APACHE II score increased the odds of hospital mortality, while a higher calendar year of diagnosis reduced the odds of mortality. This was unchanged when dominant respiratory treatment, PIP and PEEP were added to the model. The 10-year survival of ARDS survivors was 68% compared with 90% survival of a reference population (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The incidence of ARDS has almost doubled, but hospital mortality has decreased during the 23 years of observation. The 10-year survival of ARDS survivors is poor compared with the reference population."
2803793,"Prevalence of Rett syndrome (RS) was studied in Tokyo. Based on the experience of our pilot study, we chose schools to identify the cases. We visited forty-four schools for mentally/physically handicapped children. The population of girls aged 6-14 years in the area was 598,000 and the number of girls examined at the schools was 1,311. We identified 24 cases with ""classical"" RS and 6 cases with ""variant"" RS. About one-third of the cases had not been diagnosed properly. The prevalence of RS was 0.50/10,000 girls age 6-14 years in metropolitan Tokyo, 1 April, 1988, including variants. The rate showed no statistical difference compared to those reported from European countries."
28659150,"PWS is a severe neurodevelopmental genetic disorder now usually diagnosed in the neonatal period from hypotonia and feeding difficulties. Our study analyzed the birth incidence and care of infants with early diagnosis.Data were collected on 61 infants with a molecular diagnosis of PWS born in 2012 and 2013 in France.Thirty-eight infants with PWS were born in 2013. The median age at diagnosis was 18 days. Birth incidence calculated for 2013 was 1/21,000 births. No case was diagnosed prenatally, despite 9 amniocenteses, including 4 for polyhydramnios. Five infants had delayed diagnosis, after 3 months of life. For 2 of them, the diagnosis was not suspected at birth and for 3, FISH analysis in the neonatal period was normal, with no further molecular studies. Ninety-three percent of the neonates were hospitalized, and 84% needed nasogastric tube feeding for a median of 38 days. Swallowing assessment was performed for 45%, at a median age of 10 days. Physiotherapy was started for 76% during hospitalization. Eighty percent of those diagnosed within the first 3 months were seen by a pediatric endocrinologist within the first week of life.Our study is the first to assess the birth incidence of PWS in France, at 1/21,000 births. Some prenatal or neonatal cases remain undiagnosed because of unrecognized clinical signs and the inappropriate choice of the initial molecular test. We also underscore the need to optimize neonatal care of infants with PWS."
10480370,"We have calculated the relative frequency and the birth prevalence of lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) in The Netherlands based on all 963 enzymatically confirmed cases diagnosed during the period 1970-1996. The combined birth prevalence for all LSDs is 14 per 100,000 live births. Glycogenosis type II is the most frequent LSD with a birth prevalence of 2.0 per 100,000 live births, representing 17% of all diagnosed cases. Within the group of lipidoses, metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) is the most frequent LSD. MLD was diagnosed in 24% of lipidoses and the calculated birth prevalence was 1.42 per 100,000 for all types combined. Krabbe disease, diagnosed in 17% of cases, also belongs to the more frequent lipid storage diseases in The Netherlands with a birth prevalence of 1.35 per 100,000. The birth prevalence of Gaucher disease, commonly regarded as the most frequent lipid storage disease is 1.16 per 100,000 for all types combined. The combined birth prevalence for all lipid storage diseases is 6.2 per 100,000 live births. Within the group of mucopolysaccharidoses (MPSs), MPS I has the highest calculated birth prevalence of 1.19 per 100,000 (25% of all cases of MPS diagnosed), which is slightly more frequent than MPS IIIA with an estimated birth prevalence of 1.16 per 100,000. As a group, MPS III comprises 47% of all MPS cases diagnosed and the combined birth prevalence is 1.89 per 100,000 live births. The birth prevalence of MPS II is 0.67 per 100,000 (1.30 per 100,000 male live births). All other MPSs are rare. The combined birth prevalence for all MPSs is 4.5 per 100,000 live births. Mucolipidoses and oligosaccharidoses are very rare with birth prevalences between 0.04 and 0.20 for individual diseases. Only 49 cases were diagnosed between 1970 and 1996. Their combined birth prevalence is 1.0 per 100,000 live births."
23623669,"BACKGROUND: Tako-Tsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC) is a recently described medical entity and the incidence of TTC in a global population is still uncertain. We sought to prospectively assess the incidence of TTC in a large urban area. METHODS AND RESULTS: We included all consecutive patients referred for coronary angiography in three hospitals located in Paris and its suburbs. We prospectively estimated the percentage of TTC among patients referred for coronary angiography and extrapolated the number of cases of TTC in the greater Paris area (11,598,866 inhabitants) according to the CARDIO-ARHIF registry (government agency). Among 2547 patients (2972 coronary angiographies) including 815 acute coronary syndromes, 20 patients presented with TTC (19 women, mean age 66 ± 13 years). The percentage of TTC among suspected acute coronary syndromes was 2.5% (8.2% in women versus 0.2% in men, p<0.001). In the CARDIO-ARHIF registry, we individualized 51,403 coronary angiographies performed in all catheterization laboratories in one year (13,820 women and 10,246 women ≥ 60 years). In this region, the yearly number of TTC cases is estimated to be 346 (95% CI: 216-520). The annual incidence of TTC is estimated to be 29.8 per 1,000,000 inhabitants (95% CI: 18.6-44.9), 48.2 per 1,000,000 inhabitants (95% CI: 29.7-73.0) among women and 187.4 per 1,000,000 inhabitants (95% CI: 103.3-307.2) among women ≥ 60 years. CONCLUSIONS: Within a large urban agglomeration, the incidence of TTC is high in women ≥ 60 years. The current rate of this recently described cardiomyopathy has been underestimated in previous retrospective studies and will probably rise with the increase of life expectancy."
17191150,"This is the second report on the continuing efforts of LAGID to increase the recognition and registration of patients with primary immunodeficiency diseases in 12 Latin American countries: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Honduras, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela. This report reveals that from a total of 3321 patients registered, the most common form of primary immunodeficiency disease was predominantly antibody deficiency (53.2%) with IgA deficiency reported as the most frequent phenotype. This category was followed by 22.6% other well-defined ID syndromes, 9.5% combined T- and B-cell inmunodeficiency, 8.6% phagocytic disorders, 3.3% diseases of immune dysregulation, and 2.8% complement deficiencies. All countries that participated in the first publication in 1998 reported an increase in registered primary immunodeficiency cases, ranging between 10 and 80%. A comparison of the estimated minimal incidence of X-linked agammaglobulinemia, chronic granulomatous disease, and severe combined immunodeficiency between the first report and the present one shows an increase in the reporting of these diseases in all countries. In this report, the estimated minimal incidence of chronic granulomatous disease was between 0.72 and 1.26 cases per 100,000 births in Argentina, Chile, Costa Rica, and Uruguay and the incidence of severe combined immunodeficiency was 1.28 and 3.79 per 100,000 births in Chile and Costa Rica, respectively. However, these diseases are underreported in other participating countries. In addition to a better diagnosis of primary immunodeficiency diseases, more work on improving the registration of patients by each participating country and by countries that have not yet joined LAGID is still needed."
24630706,"Anisakiasis is a fish-borne zoonosis caused by third stage larvae of the nematode Anisakis sp. present in fish or cephalopods. This is the first contribution to the molecular identification and epidemiology of Anisakis spp. in commercial fish from the Gulf of Asinara (Sardinia, western Mediterranean Sea). Between April 2006 to November 2011, 777 specimens of 10 fish species (Engraulis encrasicolus, Merluccius merluccius, Micromesistius poutassou, Phycis blennoides, Sardina pilchardus, Sardinella aurita, Scomber colias, Sphyraena viridensis, Trachurus mediterraneus, Trachurus trachurus) were examined for Anisakis sp. larvae. A total of 1286 larvae were found in 218 fish. The great majority of larvae were located in the body cavity, and only a small part (60, 4.7%) in the muscle. All the Type I larvae (1272) were identified as Anisakis pegreffii and all the Type II (14) as Anisakis physeteris, confirming that A. pegreffii is the dominant species and the most important agent of human anisakiasis in the western Mediterranean Sea."
23146298,"BACKGROUND: There is very little published information about the prevalence, patterns, and predictors of peripheral neuropathies. The current study is a community-based survey was conducted in the Assiut Governorate to estimate their prevalence and clinical profile. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A door-to-door study was carried out on 42,223 persons from rural and urban communities in the Assiut Governorate, Egypt. There were 13,288 (31.5%) subjects from the urban and 28,935 (68·5%) from the rural area. All subjects filled in a questionnaire designed specifically for diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy. Positive cases were then given a complete medical and neurological examination, routine laboratory tests, neurophysiology, and neuroimaging (magnetic resonance). RESULTS: The crude prevalence rate (CPR) of peripheral neuropathy was 3181/100,000 inhabitants. There was a significantly higher prevalence in the rural compared with the urban population (3795 versus 1844/100,000) and in females than males (4473 versus 1943/100,000; P<0.001 for both). The most common type reported was entrapment neuropathy (736 cases with CPR of 1743/100,000), particularly carpal tunnel syndrome (1686/100,000). Diabetic neuropathy was the most common non-compressive neuropathy with a CPR of 649/100,000. Type II diabetes was recorded in 241 patients with a CPR of 571/100,000. Compressive radiculopathy had a crude prevalence of 358/100,000; traumatic and iatrogenic radiculopathy had a prevalence rate of 149/100,000. Less common conditions were: uremic neuropathy (21/100,000) hepatic neuropathy (14/100,000), Bell's palsy (28/100,000), Guillian-Barre' syndrome (12/100,000), chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (12/100,000), hereditary sensory motor neuropathy (12/100,000), and idiopathic neuropathy (92/100,000). CONCLUSION: The overall prevalence of peripheral neuropathies was high in comparison to other studies. Entrapment neuropathy, diabetic neuropathy, and spondylotic radiculopathy were the most common. Overall, the prevalence of peripheral neuropathy was higher in the rural than in the urban population."
15543083,"In September 1999, several Canadian provinces had place-of-sale restrictions lifted that had limited the sale of acetaminophen >325 mg and packages >24 tablets (any strength) to pharmacies only. This allowed the sale of all strengths of immediate-release acetaminophen in all package sizes in nonpharmacy locations. This study's purpose was to explore the effect that lifting restrictions on acetaminophen place of sale may have had on reported hospitalizations in Canada related to acetaminophen overdose toxicity. Using hospital discharge data, provinces with no preexisting restrictions on place of sale were compared with those in which restrictions were lifted in September 1999. Cases of reported APAP overdose included ICD-9/9-CM code 965.4, ICD-9 code E850.2, or ICD-9-CM code E850.4. Cases with reported acute liver toxicity included ICD-9/9-CM codes 570, 572.2, 572.4, V42.7, or procedure code 50.5. There were no significant differences between the 1.5-year periods pre- and post-September 1999 in annual incidence rates per 100,000 persons ages >/=12 years of hospitalizations reported with acetaminophen overdose, either overall or limited to those with death as an outcome, or in hospitalization reports with both acetaminophen overdose and acute liver toxicity, either overall (provinces with no restrictions: pre = 0.70, post = 0.80, P = 0.6328; provinces with restrictions lifted in September 1999: pre = 0.49, post = 0.47, P = 0.8649) or limited to those with death as an outcome (provinces with no restrictions: pre = 0.22, post = 0.12, P = 0.3030; provinces with restrictions lifted in September 1999: pre = 0.13, post = 0.09, P = 0.3589). In conclusion, the decision to lift Canadian place-of-sale restrictions increased acetaminophen availability and did not increase the rate of reported hospitalizations related to acetaminophen overdose toxicity."
17994169,"BACKGROUND: There are only scarce epidemiological data on the prevalence of erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) in a given population. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of EPP within the Slovenian population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The patients were selected by routine examination of photosensitive patients and by studying hospital records. A quantitative spectrophotometric method was used to assess protoporphyrin, with values larger than 530 nm/l considered elevated. RESULTS: 32 EPP patients were detected, which allows us to estimate the prevalence of EPP in Slovenia at 1.75 per 100,000 inhabitants."
28648494,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS:Only a few epidemiological studies on the incidence and prevalence of Wilson's disease (WD) have been performed to date, and the results vary widely according to the reports. The aim of the study was to investigate the prevalence, ambulatory care and treatments of patients with WD in France. METHODS:Among the 58 million general health scheme beneficiaries (86% of the French population), people managed for WD in 2013 were identified using hospitalisation diagnosis in 2011-2013 or specific long-term disease status with a 100% reimbursement for specific healthcare in 2013. Data were derived from the Sniiram (National Health Insurance Information System database). Prevalence by age and sex were calculated. RESULTS:In 2013, 906 prevalent cases were identified, yielding a crude prevalence of 1.5 cases per 100,000; 1.65 per 100,000 in males and 1.44 per 100,000 in females. This prevalence is comparable to that reported in other population-based studies in European countries and to a study using a similar method. Almost 40% of patients were treated by D-penicillamine and 14.3% were treated by zinc acetate. Trientine, delivered on a compassionate basis, was not available in the reimbursement database. In 2013, 1.3% of patients underwent liver transplantation and 4% had already undergone liver transplantation in previous years. Fifteen per cent of patients received antidepressants, a higher rate than in general population. CONCLUSIONS:This is the first French population-based epidemiological study of WD in a comprehensive population based on administrative data and constitutes an important step to understand the impact of WD and to study quality of care."
23331413,"Autosomal Dominant Cerebellar Ataxia (ADCA) Type III is a type of spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) classically characterized by pure cerebellar ataxia and occasionally by non-cerebellar signs such as pyramidal signs, ophthalmoplegia, and tremor. The onset of symptoms typically occurs in adulthood; however, a minority of patients develop clinical features in adolescence. The incidence of ADCA Type III is unknown. ADCA Type III consists of six subtypes, SCA5, SCA6, SCA11, SCA26, SCA30, and SCA31. The subtype SCA6 is the most common. These subtypes are associated with four causative genes and two loci. The severity of symptoms and age of onset can vary between each SCA subtype and even between families with the same subtype. SCA5 and SCA11 are caused by specific gene mutations such as missense, inframe deletions, and frameshift insertions or deletions. SCA6 is caused by trinucleotide CAG repeat expansions encoding large uninterrupted glutamine tracts. SCA31 is caused by repeat expansions that fall outside of the protein-coding region of the disease gene. Currently, there are no specific gene mutations associated with SCA26 or SCA30, though there is a confirmed locus for each subtype. This disease is mainly diagnosed via genetic testing; however, differential diagnoses include pure cerebellar ataxia and non-cerebellar features in addition to ataxia. Although not fatal, ADCA Type III may cause dysphagia and falls, which reduce the quality of life of the patients and may in turn shorten the lifespan. The therapy for ADCA Type III is supportive and includes occupational and speech modalities. There is no cure for ADCA Type III, but a number of recent studies have highlighted novel therapies, which bring hope for future curative treatments."
15264985,"Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a serious disorder with a worldwide prevalence of approximately 3/100,000 persons. TSS is mainly caused by Streptococcus pyogenes or Staphylococcus aureus. Thus, beta-lactam and lincosamides, such as clindamycin, are the first-line drugs. Yet, the mortality rate remains unacceptably high; highlighting the role of bacterial toxin-mediated activation of the inflammatory cascade in TSS pathogenesis. Further strategies should be targeted towards interfering with the interaction between bacterial toxins and host T cells. This paper aims to provide an overview of the epidemiology, pathomechanisms, and clinical presentation of TSS, and criteria for selecting drugs among available antibiotics."
20384468,"OBJECTIVE:Changes in prenatal diagnosis and maternal age are likely to have an impact on live born prevalence of trisomies 13 and 18. We investigated trends in diagnosis, prevalence, and survival in these conditions. METHODS:A population-based study of one UK health region in 1985-2007 using a well-established congenital abnormality register. Individual records were reviewed and live birth and maternal age data obtained. RESULTS:Pregnancies with trisomies 13 and 18 increased from 0.08 to 0.23 per 1000 registered births and 0.20 to 0.65 per 1000 registered births, respectively. Prenatal diagnosis increased and was associated with high termination rates. Live born prevalence with trisomy 13 decreased from 0.05 to 0.03 per 1000 live births and with trisomy 18 from 0.16 to 0.10 per 1000 live births. Postnatal survival remains poor: one baby (3%) with trisomy 13 and four (6%) with trisomy 18 survived the first year. The percentage of mothers over 35 years increased from 6 to 15%. CONCLUSIONS:Changes in prenatal screening and maternal age have had dramatic effects on the live born prevalence of trisomies 13 and 18. Infant survival remains largely unchanged with the majority dying in the neonatal period."
18182643,"We sought to determine the incidence, prevalence, and life expectancy of Aicardi syndrome from 408 cases compiled from multiple international sources. Last known age ranged from less than 1 month to 42 years. The incidence rates per live births for the United States and The Netherlands were 1 per 105 000 and 1 per 93 000, respectively. The prevalence in the United States is greater than 853 cases, and the worldwide estimate is several thousand. Forty-five cases were deceased (age range, 1 month to 33 years), and the risk of death peaked at age 16. The probability of survival at 27 years of age was 0.62 (95% CI, 0.47-0.77). The risk of death by age follows other congenital neurological disorders with a wide range in severity of functional disability. The longer life expectancy found in our study hints at a higher functioning capacity in Aicardi syndrome and may inform counseling to families."
6885960,"The Usher Syndrome (US) refers to the combined neurosensory deficits of profound hearing impairment and retinitis pigmentosa. We have obtained information on 600 cases of deaf-blindness from the registry of the Helen Keller National Center for Deaf-Blind Youths and Adults (HKNC). Of these, 54% met the diagnostic criteria of US, although only 23.8% were so diagnosed. More extensive analysis of 189 Usher clients from HKNC showed an excess of males, some variability in audiograms, and wide ophthalmologic variation. Genetic analysis of 113 sibships showed a segregation ratio consistent with recessive inheritance. The Acadian population of Louisiana has a high frequency of US which contributes significantly to the deaf population of the state. Among 48 cases from the Louisiana School for the Deaf, there was an excess of males, more variability in audiograms than expected, and an increased segregation ratio in the 26 informative sibships. Estimates of prevalence obtained using registry data and statistics from Louisiana clearly suggest that the previous estimate of 2.4 per 100,000 is too low for the United States. Recognizing problems with ascertainment, our prevalence estimate of 4.4 per 100,000 is still considered quite conservative."
16575897,"BACKGROUND: In the past, northern China's Shanxi Province has reported the highest incidence of neural tube defects (NTDs) in the world. However, little is known about the epidemiology of NTDs in this area in recent years. METHODS: Data were collected from a population-based birth defects surveillance system in 4 counties that captures information on all live births, stillbirths of at least 20 weeks' gestation, and pregnancy terminations at any gestational age resulting from prenatal diagnosis of a birth defect. We also surveyed mothers of NTD case patients to determine their use of folic acid before and during early pregnancy. RESULTS: During 2003, 160 NTD cases were identified among 11,534 births (NTD birth prevalence = 138.7/10,000 births). The rates of anencephaly, spina bifida and encephalocele were 65.9, 58.1, and 14.7 per 10,000, respectively, and a female predominance was observed among anencephaly cases (male-to-female relative risk [RR], 0.49; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.30-0.79), but not among spina bifida (RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.55-1.45) and encephalocele (RR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.40-2.69) cases. The percentages of pregnancy termination following prenatal diagnosis of anencephaly, spina bifida, and encephalocele were 50%, 41.8%, and 35.3%, respectively. NTD birth prevalence tended to be higher among mothers aged <20 or > or =30 years (P = .06) and was markedly associated with lower levels of maternal education (P < .001). Among 143 NTD mothers, only 6 (4.2%) used folic acid supplements during the periconceptional period. CONCLUSIONS: The NTD birth prevalence rate in the study area is among the highest worldwide. Folic acid deficiency may be one important risk factor."
20502448,"OBJECTIVES: In a population-based, well-defined group of patients first regarded as having pancreatitis of unknown origin (PUO), we identified, described, and compared the clinical and genetic aspects of patients with hereditary pancreatitis (HP) and with cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene (CFTR) and serine protease inhibitor Kazal type 1 gene (SPINK1) mutations with patients who retained the diagnosis of true idiopathic pancreatitis (tIP) after genetic testing for HP, SPINK1, and CFTR mutations. METHODS: Patients with PUO were identified in the Danish National Registry of Patients or were referred by clinicians. DNA from blood was analyzed for cationic trypsinogen (PRSS1), SPINK1, and CFTR mutations. Considering the diagnosis of HP, a pedigree was drawn for each patient. RESULTS: A genetic mutation was found in 40% of 122 patients with PUO. After testing first-degree relatives of the 18 initially identified HP patients, 38 HP patients in total were identified, and 28 patients had SPINK1-CFTR mutations. Among HP patients, no p.N29I mutations were found and the p.A16V mutation was more frequent than previously reported, 45 and 32% had exocrine and endocrine insufficiency, respectively, and among tIP patients 9 and 12%, respectively. Pancreatic cancer was diagnosed in 5% of the HP families. CONCLUSIONS: The genotype of the Danish population with HP differs from that of previously described cohorts. The occurrence of exocrine and endocrine insufficiency is higher among patients with HP than in patients with SPINK1-CFTR mutations and tIP, and more HP families develop pancreatic cancer. Genetic testing thus helps to predict the prognosis of the pancreatitis."
23871404,"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare autosomal recessive disease, caused by specific primary structural and/or functional abnormalities of the motile cilia. Prevalence, about 1/15,000 to 1/30,000, is probably underestimated, as diagnosis might not be evocated in absence of Kartagener syndrome. Diagnosis is confirmed in presence of abnormal ciliary motility as well as ciliary ultrastructure. Disease-causing mutations in at least 16 genes have already been identified; analysis will be guided by the type of ultrastructural abnormalities. An early and adequate diagnosis and therapy can theoretically improve the prognosis of the disease."
2092586,"The results of a survey of the birth prevalence of congenital anomalies among 27,472 consecutive newborn babies at a large maternity hospital in Tokyo are reported. There were 29 cases with trisomy-21; 5 cases with trisomy-13 syndrome; 5 with trisomy-18 syndrome; 2 with cri-du-chat syndrome; and one each with partial monosomy 4p, partial trisomy 5p, partial trisomy 6p, partial trisomy 9p, partial trisomy 9q, partial monosomy 10p, and partial monosomy 13q. Single cases of the following were observed: the Hallermann-Streiff syndrome, the Treacher-Collins syndrome, achondroplasia, arthrogryposis, the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, the asplenia syndrome, the Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome, the Marfan syndrome, the Carpenter syndrome, the Goldenhar syndrome, and the Pierre Robin syndrome. The results of follow-ups to determine the life-prognosis of each patient with an autosomal aberration are reported."
11683078,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the sensitivity of ultrasonography in screening for foetal malformations in the pregnant women of the Swiss Canton of Vaud. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study over a period of five years. METHOD: We focused our study on 512 major or minor clinically relevant malformations detectable by ultrasonography. We analysed the global sensitivity of the screening and compared the performance of the tertiary centre with that of practitioners working in private practice or regional hospitals. RESULTS: Among the 512 malformations, 181 (35%) involved the renal and urinary tract system, 137 (27%) the heart, 71 (14%) the central nervous system, 50 (10%) the digestive system, 42 (8%) the face and 31 (6%) the limbs. Global sensitivity was 54.5%. The lowest detection rate was observed for cardiac anomalies, with only 23% correct diagnoses. The tertiary centre achieved a 75% detection rate in its outpatient clinic and 83% in referred patients. Outside the referral centre, the diagnostic rate attained 47%. CONCLUSIONS: Routine foetal examination by ultrasonography in a low-risk population can detect foetal structural abnormalities. Apart from the diagnosis of cardiac abnormalities, the results in the Canton of Vaud are satisfactory and justify routine screening for malformations in a low-risk population. A prerequisite is continuing improvement in the skills of ultrasonographers through medical education."
11511710,"OBJECTIVES:To study the epidemiological characteristics of myasthenia gravis in Greece. METHODS:A population based study was carried out of seropositive myasthenia gravis in Greece for the period from 1 January 1983 to 30 June 1997; 843 patients were studied. RESULTS:The average annual incidence for the period 1992-7, for which the database is complete, was 7.40/million population/year (women 7.14; men 7.66). On 1 July 1997, there were 740 prevalent cases. The point prevalence rate was 70.63/million (women 81.58; men 59.39). The average overall annual mortality rate in the patients was 0.67/million population (women 0.53; men 0.82), and the mortality rate attributed to myasthenia gravis was 0.43/million population (women 0.41; men 0.45). The average age at onset was 46.50 years (women 40.16; men 54.46), and the mean age of the prevalent patients was 52.58 (women 47.65; men 59.48). The women:men incidence ratio was 1:1.04, and the prevalence ratio was 1.41:1. It is predicted that the prevalence and women: men prevalence ratio would increase if the patient list included all patients with a date of onset before 1983. CONCLUSIONS:The largest epidemiological study ever performed on myasthenia gravis is presented. The most important epidemiological indexes are provided."
15637722,"CHARGE syndrome is a well-characterized clinical diagnosis with recent data supporting a genetic etiology. A 3-year national surveillance coordinated by the Canadian Pediatric Surveillance Program (CPSP) was started in September 2001. Physicians notified the CPSP if they had cared for individuals with CHARGE syndrome within their practice, and then completed a detailed reporting form. To date, there are 77 confirmed cases of CHARGE syndrome. The highest provincial prevalence of CHARGE syndrome in Canada was estimated at 1 in 8,500 live births. Subgroups of cases with particular clusters of anomalies were identified. In older individuals, bilateral posterior choanal atresia (BPCA) was predictive of the presence of the three other major criteria and of aortic arch anomalies. Individuals with CHARGE syndrome who demonstrated a less extensive phenotype (<or=3 major criteria) were more likely to present with minor cardiovascular malformations, including small atrial or ventricular septal defects (VSD) or patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). A significant cause of morbidity was severe feeding difficulty, including problems with chewing, swallowing, and gastroesophageal reflux, which were prevalent throughout childhood. Infant mortality is high in individuals with CHARGE syndrome. However, life expectancy has improved for those surviving their first year. Increased mortality was associated with distinct cardiovascular malformations or ventriculomegaly combined with brainstem or cerebellar anomalies. From this study, revised diagnostic criteria are proposed for infants, children, and adolescents to help identify a group of individuals who represent CHARGE syndrome with more of the classical features as apposed to the boarder association."

The incidence rate (age and sex adjusted to the 2000 US white population) was 4.30 (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.62-4.98) per 100,000. The age- and sex-adjusted prevalence as of January 1, 2006, was 73.24 (95% CI, 58.29-88.19) per 100,000. Nineteen patients with CLE had disease progression to SLE: cumulative incidence at 20 years, 19%; mean (SD) length to progression, 8.2 (6.3) years. Compared with a previously reported incidence of 2.78 (95% CI, 2.08-3.49) per 100,000 for SLE among Rochester, Minnesota, residents in 1965 through 1992, the incidence of CLE in Rochester was 3.08 (95% CI, 2.32-3.83) per 100,000 in 1965 through 1992.The incidence of CLE is comparable to the published incidence of SLE. Our findings double the incidence of the root designation of the disease process known as LE (SLE and CLE)."
23495212,"Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy (HASN) refers to a group of rare congenital disorders characterized by loss of pain sensation and other sensory or autonomic abnormalities. Among them, a relatively large proportion of patients with HSAN type IV, which is accompanied by anhidrosis and intellectual disability, are reported from Israel and Japan. HSAN type V, with normal sweating and mental development, is rarely reported in Japan. In 2009, we founded a research group for congenital insensitivity to pain and performed the first epidemiological survey of HSAN types IV and V in Japan. Questionnaires were sent to a total of 3,488 certified training institutions of five nationwide medical societies comprising pediatricians, neurologists, orthopedic surgeons, and dentists. Answers were obtained from 1,610 institutions, and 192 HSAN patients (152 with type IV and 28 with type V) were reported from 105 institutions. After excluding duplicated patients, we identified a total of 62 current, 36 past, and five deceased patients for HSAN-IV, and a total of 14 current, 13 past, and 0 deceased patients for HSAN-V. Using these figures, we estimated that the number of Japanese patients with HSAN types IV and V as 130-210 and 30-60 patients, respectively. We identified no gender differences, and patients with a family history of the disorder were limited to affected siblings in both conditions. Most patients with HSAN-IV were 5-40 years of age, whereas half of the patients with HSAN-V were 40 years or older."
22517534,"BACKGROUND: The objectives of this study were to measure the incidence of sarcomas, including viscerally sited tumors that are not reported in cancer statistics, and to draw explanatory clues from a large and reliable sarcoma incidence data set. METHODS: Cases of sarcomas regardless of primary site (except bone and joints) were collected during 2 years in 3 European regions totaling approximately 26,000,000 person-years. The sources used were pathology reports and hospital discharges forms. Diagnoses were reviewed by expert sarcoma pathologists and were classified according to 2002 World Health Organization criteria. Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) were considered those located in arms, legs, trunk, head, neck, and retroperitoneum; visceral sarcomas (VS) were considered those that arose in internal organs. Rates were age standardized using the European (ASR-E) and the USA standard population. The rate of coexistence of VS and STS was calculated by dividing the 2 corresponding ASRs. RESULTS: There were 1558 sarcomas, 968 STS, and 590 VS. The ASRs-USA per 100,000 person-years was 5.12 × 10(5)  among males and 4.58 × 10(5)  among females for all sarcomas. For males and females, respectively, the ASR-E per 100,000 person-years was 3.58 × 10(5)  and 2.55 × 10(5) , respectively, for STS; 1.47 × 10(5)  and 1.97 × 10(5) , respectively, for VS; and 0.55 × 10(5)  and 0.10 × 10(5) , respectively, for Kaposi sarcoma. The coexistence rate of VS and STS was 0.41 for males and 0.77 for females. For dermatofibrosarcoma (both sexes), uterine sarcoma, liposarcoma (females), and leiomyosarcoma, including or excluding the uterus (females), the age-specific rates depicted a curve with a rapid increasing trend until ages 40 to 50 years and little variation thereafter. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the incidence of STS, VS incidence made up an additional 41% in males and 77% in females. Because the shape of age-specific curves for some histotypes was similar to that of breast cancer, the authors concluded that sex hormones (plus many chemicals that act as endocrine disruptors) may be involved in carcinogenesis. This evidence could pave the way to investigate alternative treatments and to explore etiology. Cancer 2012. © 2012 American Cancer Society."
16862044,"X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) is a primary immunodeficiency caused by mutations in the gene for Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) that result in the deficient development of B lymphocytes and hypogammaglobulinemia. Because the disorder is uncommon, no single institution has had sufficient numbers of patients to develop a comprehensive clinical picture of the disorder. Accordingly, a national registry of United States residents with XLA was established in 1999 to provide an updated clinical view of the disorder in a large cohort of patients. A total of 201 patients were registered by 66 physicians. The estimated birth rate for the 10-year period of 1988-1997 was 1/379,000. Infection was the most common initial clinical presentation (85%), followed by a positive family history (41%) and neutropenia (11%). Although the average age of diagnosis was younger in patients with a positive family history (mean, 2.59 yr) than in patients with a negative family history (mean, 5.37 yr) (p < 0.001), only 34.5% of patients with a positive family history at the time of their birth were diagnosed before clinical symptoms developed-that is, based on family history alone. Seventy percent of patients had at least 1 episode of otitis, 62% at least 1 episode of pneumonia, 60% at least 1 episode of sinusitis, 23% at least 1 episode of chronic/recurrent diarrhea, 21% at least 1 episode of conjunctivitis, 18% at least 1 episode of pyoderma and/or cellulitis, 11% at least 1 episode of meningitis/encephalitis, 10% at least 1 episode of sepsis, 8% at least 1 episode of septic arthritis, 6% at least 1 episode of hepatitis, and 3% at least 1 episode of osteomyelitis. Fourteen of 201 (6.9%) patients were dead at the time they were entered in the Registry. However, in a prospective 4 /4-year follow-up of living patients, only 3/80 (3.75%) patients died. Causes of death included disseminated enterovirus infection (n = 6), pulmonary insufficiency (n = 5), adenovirus infection (n = 1), sepsis (n = 1), acquired immunodeficiency disease syndrome (AIDS) (n = 1), myocarditis (n = 1), hepatitis (n = 2), and stem cell transplantation (n = 1)."

14697070,"OBJECTIVE: To give an epidemiological description of the clinical entity given the name Pierre Robin sequence, defined by retro- and micrognathia, cleft palate, and respiratory distress and describe other malformations and possible intrauterine impairment. METHODS: Using the inclusion criteria of micrognathia, cleft palate, and neonatal respiratory distress, a retrospective population-based study of all Danish live births during 1990 through 1999 were carried out. We found 50 children, 25 boys and 25 girls, fulfilling the inclusion criteria, giving an incidence of 1 in 14,000 live births. RESULTS: Two-thirds (n = 33) of the children had the classical U-shaped cleft palate. More than one-third (n = 19) had one or several other malformations, and in five patients the triad of Pierre Robin was a minor feature of a complex syndrome. The most common noncomplex syndrome was the Stickler syndrome found in 6 of the 50 patients. More than one-fourth (n = 17) had some kind of intrauterine impairment, with no specific obstetric diagnosis predominant. Consistent with this, the average birth weight was well below normal. CONCLUSIONS: Several authors have stated that the triad of Pierre Robin is not a nosological entity, in that it has diverse etiology and diverse pathogenesis. We conclude that the triad of Pierre Robin still can be regarded as a clinical entity, readily defined at birth, experiencing the same neonatal problems in varying degrees and hence the possibility of designing treatment protocols for later scientific evaluation."
16332955,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the incidence and prevalence, as well as the mortality and survival rates, of primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) in a defined area of north-west Greece with a population of about 500 000 inhabitants. METHODS: Cases were recorded from the following sources: (i) in- and out-patients referred to the rheumatology clinics of the Ioannina University Hospital and the Ioannina General Hospital; and (ii) patients referred to private rheumatologists practising in the study area. All patients diagnosed between 1 January 1982 and 31 December 2003 who were resident in the study area were included as incident cases. Diagnosis was based on the American-European consensus criteria for SS. Incidence and prevalence rates were calculated as numbers of cases per 10(5) inhabitants. Population data were based on the National Censuses of 1981, 1991 and 2001. RESULTS: A total of 422 incident cases were identified for the study period 1982-2003. Age-adjusted mean annual incidence rate for this period was 5.3 (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.5-6.1) cases per 10(5) adult inhabitants. The female/male ratio of incident cases was about 20/1. The age-adjusted prevalence rate for the adult population was 92.8 (95% CI 83.7-101.9) cases per 10(5) inhabitants on 31 December 2003. The 5-yr survival rate in the incidence cohort was 96.6% and the 10-yr survival rate 92.8%. The standardized mortality ratio in comparison with the general population of the study area was 1.02 (95% CI 0.4-2.0). The main causes of death were cardiovascular diseases and cancer. The occurrence of the disease shows a slightly decreasing, but not statistically significant, trend with time. CONCLUSIONS: The estimated incidence and prevalence of pSS in this study were slightly higher in comparison with data from other studies based on physician-diagnosed cases. The prevalence was significantly lower when compared with the findings of studies based on the examination of a sample of the general population. Mortality rates did not differ significantly between pSS patients and the general population."
24943712,"Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is an uncommon but highly invasive form of skin cancer. The mechanisms that cause MCC are yet to be fully determined.To compare the incidence and survival rates of MCC in Queensland, Australia, known to be a high-risk area, with MCC incidence and survival elsewhere in the world. We also analyzed incidence trends and differences in survival by key demographic and clinical characteristics.Retrospective cohort study of population-based administrative data for MCC collected by the Queensland Cancer Registry and supplemented with detailed histopathologic data. Deidentified records were obtained of all Queensland residents diagnosed as having MCC during the period from 1993 to 2010. A subsample of histopathologic records were reviewed by a senior dermatopathologist to determine the potential for misclassification. A total of 879 eligible cases of MCC were included in the study.Incidence rates were directly age standardized to the 2000 United States Standard Population. Trends were examined using Joinpoint software with results expressed in terms of the annual percentage change. The period method was used to calculate 5-year relative survival, and adjusted hazard ratios were obtained from multivariate Poisson models.There were 340 cases of MCC diagnosed in Queensland between 2006 and 2010, corresponding to an incidence rate of 1.6 per 100,000 population. Men (2.5 per 100,000) had higher incidence than women (0.9 per 100,000), and rates peaked at 20.7 per 100,000 for persons 80 years or older. The overall incidence of MCC increased by an average of 2.6% per year from 1993 onwards. Relative survival was 41% after 5 years, with significantly better survival found for those younger than 70 years at diagnosis (56%-60%), those with tumors on the face or ears (51%), and those with stage I lesions (49%).Incidence rates for MCC in Queensland are at least double those of any that have been previously published elsewhere in the world. It is likely that Queensland's combination of a predominantly white population, outdoor lifestyle, and exposure to sunlight has played a role in this unwanted result. Interventions are required to increase awareness of MCC among clinicians and the public."
15716522,"Prior to the discovery of the Huntington's disease (HD) mutation, the prevalence, incidence, and new mutation rates for this disease were based on the presence of progressive choreic movements and a positive family history.To evaluate the uptake of the HD genetic analysis in Spain, and to provide additional information on the epidemiology of this disease from the experience of 9 years of direct genetic testing.From 1994 to 2002, CAG repeat length was determined in 317 patients with symptoms compatible with HD. In all cases, demographic, clinical, and family data were carefully reviewed.HD diagnosis (CAG repeat length >/=36) was confirmed in 166 (52%) symptomatic cases. Of these, 76 (45.8%) reported a positive family history and in 21 cases (12.7%) family history was negative. New mutation events were genetically proven in three families and highly suspected in another, estimating that the minimum new mutation rate for HD in our population is >4%, with a potential mutation rate of 8%. More than 16% of all HD cases had late onset (>59 years) of symptoms, and in three quarters of these the family history was negative. The incidence rate for the autonomous communities of Navarra and the Basque country, based on the number of newly diagnosed cases by genetic testing, was 4.7 per million per year.Direct HD genetic testing shows that the incidence and mutation rates of the disease are 2-3 times higher than previously reported. We also demonstrated the relevance of CAG repeat length assessment in diagnosing patients with late onset of symptoms and negative family history for HD."
21420560,"Tuberculosis (TB) has affected humanity since the beginning of the recorded time and is associated with poverty, malnutrition, overcrowding, and immunosuppression. Since Koch discovered the infectious nature of the disease in 1882, knowledge about its history and physiopathology has advanced, but it continues to be a global public health problem. More than 9 million new cases occurred in 2008 worldwide (with an incidence of 139/100,000 inhabitants), of whom more than one million died. Over half million of the cases presented with multidrug resistant-TB. Africa represents the continent with the highest incidence and the most HIV co-infection. The situation in Eastern Europe is also worrisome because of the high incidence and frequency drug resistance. In developed countries, TB has been localized in more vulnerable populations, such as immigrants and persons with social contention. There is an increase of extra-pulmonary presentation in this context, related to non-European ethnicity, HIV infection, and younger age. In Spain, the increasing immigrant population has presented a need to improve coordination between territories and strengthen surveillance The global control plan is based on the DOTS strategy, although the objectives and activities were redefined in 2006 to incorporate the measurement of global development, and community and healthcare strengthening. Adequate control measures in a more local context and continual activity evaluation are necessary to decrease the burden of suffering and economic loss that causes this ancient disease."
19171687,"BACKGROUND: Many papers are published on cohorts with unilateral multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK) patients, but show variable results as to the incidence of associated urinary tract abnormalities. The objective of this study was to describe the status of the urinary tract, including contralateral hypertrophy and malformations, in patients with unilateral MCDK based on a meta-analysis of the literature, taking into account the timing of diagnosis (pre- versus postnatal) as a possible source of bias. METHODS: A systematic review of the scientific literature in English was conducted using PubMed and Embase. A meta-analysis was performed with the studies that were identified using our reproducible search. RESULTS: Based on analysis of the data in 19 populations, the overall incidence of unilateral MCDK is 1 in 4300 with an increasing trend over the years. A total of 67 cohorts with over 3500 patients with unilateral MCDK were included in the meta-analysis. Fifty-nine percent of patients were male and the MCDKs were significantly more often found on the left side (53.1%). Associated anomalies in the solitary functioning kidney were found in 1 in 3 patients, mainly vesicoureteric reflux (VUR, in 19.7%). In patients with VUR, 40% have severe contralateral VUR, defined as grade III-V. Contralateral hypertrophy, present in 77% of patients after a follow-up of at least 10 years, showed a trend to be less pronounced in patients with VUR. Timing of the diagnosis of MCDK did not essentially influence the results. CONCLUSIONS: These aggregate results provide insight into the incidence, demographic data and associated anomalies in patients with unilateral MCDK. One in three patients with unilateral MCDK show anomalies in the contralateral, solitary functioning kidney. However, studies into the long-term consequences of these anomalies are scarce."
18554391,"Brachydactyly (""short digits"") is a general term that refers to disproportionately short fingers and toes, and forms part of the group of limb malformations characterized by bone dysostosis. The various types of isolated brachydactyly are rare, except for types A3 and D. Brachydactyly can occur either as an isolated malformation or as a part of a complex malformation syndrome. To date, many different forms of brachydactyly have been identified. Some forms also result in short stature. In isolated brachydactyly, subtle changes elsewhere may be present. Brachydactyly may also be accompanied by other hand malformations, such as syndactyly, polydactyly, reduction defects, or symphalangism. For the majority of isolated brachydactylies and some syndromic forms of brachydactyly, the causative gene defect has been identified. In isolated brachydactyly, the inheritance is mostly autosomal dominant with variable expressivity and penetrtance. Diagnosis is clinical, anthropometric and radiological. Prenatal diagnosis is usually not indicated for isolated forms of brachydactyly, but may be appropriate in syndromic forms. Molecular studies of chorionic villus samples at 11 weeks of gestation and by amniocentesis after the 14th week of gestation can provide antenatal diagnosis if the causative mutation in the family is known. The nature of genetic counseling depends both on the pattern of inheritance of the type of brachydactyly present in the family and on the presence or absence of accompanying symptoms. There is no specific management or treatment that is applicable to all forms of brachydactyly. Plastic surgery is only indicated if the brachydactyly affects hand function or for cosmetic reasons, but is typically not needed. Physical therapy and ergotherapy may ameliorate hand function. Prognosis for the brachydactylies is strongly dependent on the nature of the brachydactyly, and may vary from excellent to severely influencing hand function. If brachydactyly forms part of a syndromic entity, prognosis often depends on the nature of the associated anomalies."
21764810,"Understanding the true prevalence of lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is important in estimating disease burden and targeting specific interventions. As with all rare diseases, obtaining reliable epidemiological data is difficult and requires innovative approaches.To determine the prevalence and incidence of LAM using data from patient organizations in seven countries, and to use the extent to which the prevalence of LAM varies regionally and nationally to determine whether prevalence estimates are related to health-care provision.Numbers of women with LAM were obtained from patient groups and national databases from seven countries (n = 1001). Prevalence was calculated for regions within countries using female population figures from census data. Incidence estimates were calculated for the USA, UK and Switzerland. Regional variation in prevalence and changes in incidence over time were analysed using Poisson regression and linear regression.Prevalence of LAM in the seven countries ranged from 3.4 to 7.8/million women with significant variation, both between countries and between states in the USA. This variation did not relate to the number of pulmonary specialists in the region nor the percentage of population with health insurance, but suggests a large number of patients remain undiagnosed. The incidence of LAM from 2004 to 2008 ranged from 0.23 to 0.31/million women/per year in the USA, UK and Switzerland.Using this method, we have found that the prevalence of LAM is higher than that previously recorded and that many patients with LAM are undiagnosed."
24636811,"INTRODUCTION: Interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) form a heterogeneous group of diseases with varying degrees of inflammation and fibrosis. Epidemiological data based on the current diagnostic criteria are sparse. OBJECTIVES: To characterize the incidence rate of ILDs and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) in Danish patients diagnosed at a referral hospital, to evaluate disease severity and survival in these ILD patients and to compare the use of the 2001 and 2011 guidelines to diagnosis of IPF. METHODS: Single-centre, retrospective, observational cohort study including incident patients diagnosed with ILD at Aarhus University Hospital between 2003 and 2009. All diagnoses were re-evaluated according to current diagnostic criteria. Disease severity in IPF was assessed using the GAP index. RESULTS: The ILD incidence was 4.1 per 100,000 inhabitants/year. IPF was the most common diagnosis (28%) followed by connective tissue disease-related ILD (14%), hypersensitivity pneumonitis (7%) and non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) (7%). The GAP index was a strong predictor of survival in IPF. Twenty-three patients who had IPF based on the 2001 criteria had a ""possible UIP"" HRCT pattern but no lung biopsy, and IPF could therefore not be diagnosed based on the 2011 criteria. CONCLUSION: ILD and IPF incidence was 4.1 and 1.3 per 100,000 inhabitants/year. The diagnostic re-evaluation raised the number of IPF diagnoses, but a diagnostic ""grey zone"" was still evident in patients with UIP features not qualifying the patients to be diagnosed with IPF. The GAP index was valuable as a measure of IPF severity in this cohort."
20948236,"BACKGROUND/METHODS: A door-to-door ('every door') study was carried out to assess the incidence and prevalence rates of epilepsy, stroke, Bell's palsy and cerebral palsy, as well as the prevalence of dementia, extrapyramidal syndromes, muscle and neuromuscular disorders, cerebellar ataxia and primary nocturnal enuresis among the urban and rural populations of Al Kharga district, New Valley, Egypt. The study was carried out in 3 stages from June 1, 2005 to May 31, 2009. A door-to-door screening including every door was carried out using a standardized questionnaire, which was administered by 3 neurologists to all inhabitants (62,583) of Al Kharga district. The study was designed to assess the prevalence, incidence and risk factors of major neurological disorders in Al Kharga district and aimed to reduce the burden of these neurological disorders in the entire region. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: This study clarified that dementia, primary nocturnal enuresis, epilepsy, stroke and cerebral palsy are the most common neurological disorders. On the other hand, Bell's palsy, extrapyramidal syndromes, cerebellar ataxia, muscle dystrophies and myasthenia gravis are less common neurological disorders in Al Kharga district."

It's varied presentations are usually considered to represent malignancy rather than an infective process - and was once described as 'the most misdiagnosed disease'. Actinomyces are gram positive bacilli of the Actinomycetales genus, and A. israelii is responsible for the majority of human disease. They are normal commensal inhabitants of the human bronchial and gastrointestinal tracts and seem to only cause pathological infection after preceding mucosal breakdown. Patients who have undergone appendicectomy, have had a missed perforated appendicitis or women with a history of intrauterine contraceptive device use are at an increased risk. Florid abscess formation with fistulation, abundant granulation and dense surrounding fibrosis are common. Diagnosis prior to, or even during, surgery is rare and the findings are usually mistaken for acute inflammatory pathologies or malignancy. The treatment of choice is prolonged antibiotic therapy, usually with penicillin to which the organisms remain exquisitely sensitive, although delayed recurrence is possible. This review outlines the historical background of actinomyceal infection and considers the epidemiology, pathophysiology and clinical features of abdominal actinomycosis."
10695258,"A nationwide epidemiologic survey of idiopathic hypoparathyroidism and pseudohypoparathyroidism was conducted in 1998 to clarify the prevalence of the two disorders in Japan. From a total of 14,100 departments of pediatrics, internal medicine, neurology, and endocrinology in whole Japan, 2952 (20.9%) study departments were selected at random. Of these departments receiving the first questionnaire, 1855 (62.8%) responded. From these departments 390 patients with idiopathic hypoparathyroidism and 203 with pseudohypoparathyroidism who visited the hospitals in 1997 were reported. The total numbers of patients were estimated to be 900 (690-1100) for idiopathic hypoparathyroidism and 430 (330-520) for pseudohypoparathyroidism (95% confidence intervals in parentheses). Using these data, the period prevalence of the diseases were 7.2 (5.5-8.8) per million population in idiopathic hypoparathyroidism, and 3.4 (2.6-4.2) in pseudohypoparathyroidism (95% confidence intervals in parentheses)."
9468178,"OBJECTIVE:To review acute lung injury (ALI) and the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in light of recent information about the definitions, epidemiology, pathophysiology, management, and outcome of these conditions. DATA SOURCES:The author's personal files as well as the computerized MEDLINE database. STUDY SOLUTION: Studies were selected for their relevance to the conditions of ALI and ARDS. DATA EXTRACTION:The author extracted all applicable data. DATA SYNTHESIS:The diagnostic criteria for ALI and ARDS include a) acute onset; b) bilateral chest radiographic infiltrates; c) a pulmonary artery occlusion pressure of < or =18 mm Hg or no evidence of left atrial hypertension; and d) impaired oxygenation manifested by a PaO2/FIO2 ratio of < or =300 torr (< or =40 kPa) for ALI and < or =200 torr (< or =27 kPa) for ARDS. The incidence of ALI and ARDS are approximately 70 and 7 patients out of 100,000 of the total U.S. population per year, respectively. The conditions result from direct or indirect injury to the pulmonary epithelium and endothelium that causes edema, atelectasis, inflammation, and fibrosis. This ""diffuse alveolar damage"" is actually patchy in many patients. Therapy of ALI and ARDS is largely supportive, although new approaches in mechanical ventilation, patient positioning, and pharmacologic therapy have been introduced. The mortality rate of ARDS has improved to <50%, but the reasons for this improvement are unclear. CONCLUSION:ALI and ARDS are better defined and understood than ever before, and their outcome has improved for unclear reasons."
27409588,"There are 16.5 million newborns in China annually. However, the incidence of congenital heart disease (CHD) has not been evaluated. In 2004, we launched an active province-wide hospital-based CHD registry in the Guangdong Province of southern China. In this study, we examined the incidence of CHD and its subtypes from 2004 to 2012 and compared our findings to the literature. Our results indicate there is an increasing trend of CHD incidence. The increase in incidence occurred mainly for single lesion and the most common subtypes (e.g., ventricular or atrial septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus). There were no increases found for multiple lesions or more complex subtypes. The proportion of CHD cases that were detected early (e.g., 1 week) increased over time. The incidence of CHD stabilized in 2010-2012 with the average cumulative incidences of 9.7, 9.9, and 11.1 per 1,000 live births at 1 week, 1 month, and 1 year, respectively. The incidences of CHD subtypes were comparable with recent international results. The data did not support previous reports that Asian children have a higher incidence of pulmonary outflow obstructions and lower incidence of transposition of the great arteries. However, there was a lower incidence of left ventricular outflow tract obstructions observed in our series. The increase in CHD incidence observed over time was due to improved detection and diagnosis. The true incidence of CHD in China was approximately 11.1 per 1,000 live births, which is higher than previously reported."
19494548,"BACKGROUND: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal progressive neurodegenerative disease of unknown etiology. Although known to be rare, precise information on the frequency of ALS is essential to anticipate future demands on health resources and as baseline information for epidemiological studies. As part of a new ALS epidemiological initiative in Canada, we conducted a systematic review of published incidence and prevalence research in Canada. METHODS: Electronic searches and bibliographic reviews of pertinent publications were conducted. RESULTS: We identified 6 published studies from 4 Canadian provinces conducted between 1974 and 2004; 2 were available only as abstracts. Reported annual incidence rates were similar and study quality was generally good, but there was insufficient detail to adequately assess the methodological quality of 3 of the studies. The most recent studies reported an annual ALS age-adjusted incidence of 2.13 per 100,000 in Nova Scotia (2003-2004) and a crude mean annual incidence of 2.4 per 100,000 in Newfoundland and Labrador (2000-2004). CONCLUSIONS: There are limited data on the frequency of ALS in Canada. We found no studies from 6 of the Canadian provinces or from the territories. Future research is needed to estimate the frequency of occurrence of ALS in Canada."
13679323,"BACKGROUND:The clinical relevance of mild erythrocytosis (hematocrit > 0.48 in women or > 0.51 in men) or thrombocytosis (platelet count > 400 x 10(9) cells/L) in asymptomatic persons is uncertain. OBJECTIVE:To estimate the frequency of polycythemia vera or essential thrombocythemia in persons with erythrocytosis or thrombocytosis in a general population. DESIGN:Cohort study. SETTING:Vicenza, Italy. PARTICIPANTS:10 000 community dwellers age 18 to 65 years and enrolled in the Vicenza Thrombophilia and Atherosclerosis project. MEASUREMENTS:Platelet count and hematocrit at baseline in all participants and at second follow-up if baseline results were abnormal. Measurement of erythrocyte sedimentation rate, peripheral arterial saturation, serum erythropoietin level, and leukocyte alkaline phosphatase level; chest radiography; abdominal ultrasonography; and occult fecal blood testing were done in persons with confirmed high hematocrit or platelet counts. Polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia were diagnosed according to the Polycythemia Study Group criteria. RESULTS:At baseline examination, 1 person had polycythemia vera, 1 had essential thrombocythemia, 88 had erythrocytosis, and 99 had thrombocytosis. Second examination confirmed erythrocytosis in 40% (95% CI, 29% to 51%) and thrombocytosis in 8% (CI, 4% to 15%) of those with abnormal baseline results. Among persons with confirmed abnormalities, further evaluation revealed 11 with idiopathic erythrocytosis, 2 with polycythemia vera (3/10 000 [CI, 0.6 to 8.7/10 000]), and 3 with essential thrombocythemia (4/10 000 [CI, 1.09 to 10.2/10 000]). After 5 years of follow-up, 1 additional person with a high platelet count developed essential thrombocythemia, and no persons developed hemorrhagic or thrombotic complications. CONCLUSIONS:The prevalences of polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia were higher than expected in this general population. However, the risks for developing polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, or associated vascular complications in persons with erythrocytosis or thrombocytosis were low."
24209901,"Limited data exist on the spectrum of heredoataxias in Greece, including the prevalence and phenotype of Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) and the prevalence and subtypes of dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs). We analyzed clinically and investigated genetically for FRDA and triplet-repeat expansion SCAs a consecutive series of 186 patients with suspected heredoataxia referred to Athens over 18 years. For prevalence estimates we included patients with molecular diagnosis from Cyprus that were absent from the Athens cohort. The minimum prevalence of FRDA was ~0.9/100,000, with clusters of high prevalence in Aegean islands. FRDA was diagnosed in 73 probands. The genotypic and phenotypic spectrum of FRDA was similar to other populations, with one patient compound heterozygote for a known point mutation in FXN (Asn146Lys). Undiagnosed recessive ataxias included FRDA-like and spastic ataxias. The minimum prevalence of dominant SCAs was ~0.7/100,000. SCA1 (4), SCA7 (4), SCA2, SCA6, and SCA17 (1 each) probands were identified. A molecular diagnosis was reached in 31% of dominant cases. Undiagnosed dominant patients included a majority of type III autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias. FRDA is the commonest heredoataxia in the Greek population with prevalence towards the lower end of other European populations. Dominant SCAs are almost as prevalent. SCA1, SCA2, SCA6, SCA7 and SCA17 patients complete the spectrum of cases with a specific molecular diagnosis."
19821525,"UNLABELLED: The recent epidemiology and outcomes of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) in North America are incompletely described, partly due to difficulties in case ascertainment. In light of their availability, broad coverage, and limited expense, administrative databases may facilitate such investigations. We used population-based administrative data (inpatient, ambulatory care, and physician billing databases) and a validated International Classification of Diseases coding algorithm to describe the epidemiology and natural history of PBC in the Calgary Health Region (population approximately 1.1 million). Between 1996 and 2002, the overall age/sex-adjusted annual incidence of PBC was 30.3 cases per million (48.4 per million in women, 10.4 per million in men). Although the incidence remained stable, the prevalence increased from 100 per million in 1996 to 227 per million in 2002 (P < 0.0005). Among 137 incident cases with a total follow-up of 801 person-years from diagnosis (median 5.8 years), 27 patients (20%) died and six (4.4%) underwent liver transplantation. The estimated 10-year probabilities of survival, liver transplantation, and transplant-free survival were 73% (95% confidence interval [CI] 60%-83%), 6% (95% CI 2.5%-12.6%), and 68% (95% CI 55%-78%), respectively. Survival in PBC patients was significantly lower than that of the age/sex-matched Canadian population (standardized mortality ratio 2.87; 95% CI 1.89-4.17); male sex (hazard ratio [HR] 3.80; 95% CI 1.85-7.82) and an older age at diagnosis (HR per additional year, 1.06; 95% CI 1.03-1.10) were independent predictors of mortality. CONCLUSION: This population-based study demonstrates that the burden of PBC in Canada is high and growing. Survival of PBC patients is significantly lower than that of the general population, emphasizing the importance of developing new therapies for this condition."
22913675,"Tangier disease is one of the most severe forms of familial high-density lipoprotein (HDL) deficiency. Since its discovery it has been diagnosed in about 100 patients and is characterized by severe plasma deficiency or absence of HDL, apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I, the major HDL apolipoprotein) and by accumulation of cholesteryl esters in many tissues throughout the body. The biochemical signs of this condition are plasma HDL concentrations less than 5 mg/dL, low total plasma cholesterol (below 150 mg/dL), and normal or high plasma triglycerides. Tangier disease is caused by mutations in the 'ATP-Binding Cassette transporter A1' (ABCA1) gene, which encodes the membrane transporter ABCA1. This transporter plays a key role in the first step of reverse cholesterol transport, through which the efflux of free cholesterol from peripheral cells is transferred to lipid-poor apoA-I. The Tangier disease clinical phenotype is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait, the biochemical phenotype is inherited as an autosomal co-dominant trait. Nearly all the children affected by Tangier disease were identified on the basis of large, yellow-orange tonsils, while half of the adult patients affected by Tangier disease came to medical attention because of symptoms of neuropathy. Diagnosis in the remaining subjects was related to the clinical features of hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, premature myocardial infarction (about 30% of Tangier disease cases) or stroke, thrombocytopenia, anemia, gastrointestinal disorders, corneal opacities, hypocholesterolemia, low HDL cholesterol, or following a familial screening of Tangier patients. To date there is no specific treatment for Tangier disease. Old and recently designed drugs, known to increase HDL levels, have been shown to be ineffective in Tangier patients. The possible and more realistic therapeutic strategy should be designed to obtain a selective increase of mature HDL concentration to restore cholesterol efflux. Recently designed drugs like the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitors dalcetrapib and anacetrapib and reconstituted forms of HDL could be considered until the development of gene therapy."
18383510,"BACKGROUND: In utero vascular disruptions are thought to be associated with a variety of birth defects. This study examined the descriptive epidemiology of several of those defects using data from a large birth defects registry. METHODS: Data on birth defects ascertained from pregnancies in 1996-2002 were obtained from the Texas Birth Defects Registry. Using Poisson regression, we calculated crude and adjusted associations between maternal and infant characteristics and birth defects thought to be related to vascular disruption. We repeated the analysis using isolated cases and cases occurring in mothers <20 years. RESULTS: The most commonly shared pattern was observed for plurality and five defects: large intestinal atresia (PR 3.67; CI: 1.63-7.13), renal agenesis (PR 2.05; CI: 1.55-2.65), transverse limb deficiency (PR 1.85; CI: 1.28-2.57), porencephaly (PR 5.18; CI: 2.40-9.87), and Goldenhar syndrome (PR 3.45; CI: 1.04-8.53). Hispanics had the highest prevalence of gastroschisis (PR 1.21; CI: 1.05-1.40), transverse limb deficiency (PR 1.19; CI: 1.01-1.40), microtia/anotia (PR 2.22; CI: 1.83-2.70), and Poland anomaly (PR 1.90; CI: 1.26-2.93). Male infants were at greatest risk for renal agenesis (PR 1.58; CI: 1.40-1.80), porencephaly (PR 1.66; CI: 1.03-2.72), and Poland anomaly (PR 1.52; CI: 1.05-2.21). CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirmed findings in previous studies, but also uncovered several new associations."
24243590,"The aim of this study was to: (a) analyze the results of a large-scale newborn screening program for Pompe disease, and (b) establish an effective diagnostic protocol to obtain immediate, valid diagnosis of infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD) to promote earlier treatment and better outcomes. In this study, 402,281 newborns were screened for Pompe disease from January 1, 2008 to May 1, 2012. Infants with low acid α-glucosidase (GAA) activity were referred to Taipei Veterans General Hospital for diagnostic confirmation. Physical examination, biochemical parameter (creatine kinase [CK], alanine transaminase, aspartate aminotransferase, and lactate dehydrogenase), and echocardiogram assessments were performed immediately to effectively differentiate IOPD from suspected late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) or false-positive cases with pseudodeficiency mutation. Six infants with IOPD all presented with hypotonia, extremely low GAA enzyme activity (≤0.5 µmol/L/hr) in initial dried blood spot analysis, high CK (≥250 U/L), and high left ventricular mass index (LVMI, ≥80 g/m(2)). By analyzing these parameters, IOPD was distinguished effectively and immediately from suspected LOPD and false-positive cases. Except for the first referred case, five of the infants with IOPD received first-time enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) within 4 hr of admission and exhibited marked improvement. Our findings indicate that certain clinical manifestations (hypotonia, high CK, enlarged LVMI, and extremely low GAA enzyme activity in initial dried blood spot analysis) can help in the rapid and effective differentiation of patients with IOPD from other patient with low GAA activity. Such differentiation allows for the early application of first-time ERT and leads to better outcomes."
15192637,Serious complications of homocystinuria caused by cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency can be prevented by early intervention. We determined the prevalence of 6 specific mutations in 1133 newborn blood samples. Our results suggest that homocystinuria is more common than previously reported. Newborn screening for homocystinuria through mutation detection should be further considered.
21928272,"A meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the prevalence of patients with molecularly confirmed Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) carrying any of the 3 primary mtDNA mutations (m.11778G>A, m.14484T>C, m.3460G>A) which cause this inherited form of blindness.A literature search was conducted to identify primary reports with LHON prevalence data reported for Europe. The overall prevalence of LHON with molecularly confirmed diagnosis was evaluated by weighting the prevalence estimates of the individual studies by the inverse of their variance.Based on this meta-analysis of 5 European studies providing appropriate information, the estimated prevalence of LHON disease associated with the combined m.11778G>A, m.14484T>C, m.3460G>A mutations was ~1:45,000 (2.23 x 10(-5); 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.01-2.44 x 10(-5)). Patients with LHON carrying either the m.11778G>A or the m.3460G>A mutation have a more severe clinical presentation and a much lower chance of spontaneous recovery from vision loss compared to patients with the m.14484T>C mutation. The estimated prevalence for patients with LHON in Europe carrying either of these severe mutations (m.11778G>A or m.3460G>A) was ~1:65,000 (1.54 x 10(-5); 95% CI 1.33-1.74 x 10(-5)).Although this meta-analysis summarizes the existing prevalence data for the primary, disease-causing mitochondrial DNA mutations of LHON in Europe, there is still a clear lack of reliable primary epidemiologic data for this devastating ophthalmologic disease."
20381841,"Prune belly syndrome (PBS) is a rare condition characterized by the congenital absence or deficiency of the abdominal wall musculature, with associated abnormalities of the genitourinary tract, including hydronephrosis and cryptorchidism. Few population-based epidemiology or mortality data are available.We retrospectively reviewed the Kids' Inpatient Database to evaluate PBS among newborn infants during their initial hospitalization in 2000, 2003, and 2006. The International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes were used to identify patients and to determine the comorbidity status. The PBS incidence, demographics, comorbid conditions, and disposition were assessed.A total of 133 newborn male infants diagnosed with PBS were identified of 1,420,991 live male births, for a weighted incidence estimate of 3.8 cases/100,000 live births. Of the newborns with PBS, 50% were white, 31% black, and 10% were Hispanic. In-hospital mortality was high (39 of 133, 29%). Of the 133 patients with PBS, 55 (41%) were discharged home and 39 (29%) required inpatient transfer or home nursing care. Fifty-seven patients (43%) were born premature; 56% of the PBS deaths occurred in premature infants. Mechanical ventilation was required in 64 newborns (48%), and 33 (24%) had coexisting congenital cardiovascular anomalies. Renal failure was uncommon, occurring in only 5 newborns (4%); none required dialysis. Only 13 patients (10%) underwent urinary diversion (vesicostomy or ureterostomy).The incidence of PBS was 3.8 cases/100,000 live births. Despite advances in care for children with PBS, this condition continues to be associated with high perinatal mortality, likely related to the associated prematurity and pulmonary complications. Renal failure was rare, as was immediate urinary diversion."
6207480,"Sarcosinemia has been detected by routine screening of urine for metabolic and transport disorders in Massachusetts. Three infants who had sarcosinemia were detected through the neonatal urine specimen, an observed incidence of 1:350,000. A fourth child had sarcosinemia detected through family screening after his brother was found to have Hartnup disease by neonatal urine screening. These four children with sarcosinemia have plasma sarcosine concentrations ranging from 80 to 603 mumol/L and urine sarcosine from 2.1 to 9.4 mumol/mg of creatinine, findings similar to those reported for persons with sarcosinemia. No treatment has been given. At 3.8 to 15 years of age, the children had normal findings on physical examination and had no specific illnesses. Their full-scale IQ scores ranged from 89 to 111. The oldest child had a learning and emotional disorder, and one other child was emotionally unstable. It was concluded that sarcosinemia as a specific disorder is probably benign and that the mental retardation and dysmorphic features described in some affected persons are likely coincidental with the biochemical defect. The emotional disturbances that were encountered in two children are also probably coincidental but need further attention in this disorder."
24849861,"Narcolepsy is a sleep disorder characterised by loss of hypothalamic hypocretin (orexin) neurons. The prevalence of narcolepsy is about 30 per 100 000 people, and typical age at onset is 12-16 years. Narcolepsy is strongly associated with the HLA-DQB1*06:02 genotype, and has been thought of as an immune-mediated disease. Other risk genes, such as T-cell-receptor α chain and purinergic receptor subtype 2Y11, are also implicated. Interest in narcolepsy has increased since the epidemiological observations that H1N1 infection and vaccination are potential triggering factors, and an increase in the incidence of narcolepsy after the pandemic AS03 adjuvanted H1N1 vaccination in 2010 from Sweden and Finland supports the immune-mediated pathogenesis. Epidemiological observations from studies in China also suggest a role for H1N1 virus infections as a trigger for narcolepsy. Although the pathological mechanisms are unknown, an H1N1 virus-derived antigen might be the trigger."
23572136,"Descriptive epidemiology of the myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) is always interesting and may reveal time-dependent and geographical variations, as well as occupational exposure. Epidemiological data in Greece are not available by now. We have collected and analyzed medical records of all patients with a documented diagnosis of MDS, performed by an expert hematologist and/or hematopathologist, in the geographical area of Western Greece, during the 20-year period, defined between 1990 and 2009. We have then calculated and described demographic and clinical features of the diagnosed MDS patient population, and assessed the incidence and prevalence rates of MDS in Western Greece, during the above-mentioned period. A total of 855 patients with newly diagnosed MDS have been identified. Refractory anemia was the most common subtype in both FAB and WHO classification systems and in both genders. Del-5q and RARS were more commonly encountered among females, and the dysplastic subtype of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia among males. Trisomy 8 was the most common single cytogenetic abnormality. The crude mean annual incidence rate of MDS was 6.0 per 100,000 inhabitants aged ≥15 years old (all subtypes according to FAB), and it was 4.8 per 100,000 when CMML and RAEB-T were excluded. Crude incidence rate was higher in rural than in urban areas, but this finding was not confirmed after age standardization. Age-standardized mean annual incidence rate in men was 7.9/100,000 and in women 3.4/100,000. A continuously increasing incidence rate of MDS has been observed throughout the study period."
15906713,"Seoul Clinical Laboratories began screening newborns and high risk group blood spots with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) in April 2001. The goal was to determine approximate prevalence of metabolic disorders and optimization of decision criteria for estimation of preventive effect with early diagnosis. Approximately 44,300 neonates and children were screened and the estimated prevalence (newborn/high risk group), sensitivity, specificity and recall rate amounted to 1:2000 / 1:1250, 94.1 %, 99.7 %, and 0.04 %, respectively. Confirmed 35 multiple metabolic disorders (newborn/high risk) were as follows; 16 amino acid disorders [classical PKU(3/4), BH4 deficient-hyperphenylalaninemia(0/1), Citrullinemia(2/0), Homocystinuria(0/2), Hypermethioninemia(0/1), Tyrosinemia(1/0)], OTC deficiency (0/1), MSUD (2/0), 10 organic acidurias [Propionic aciduria(2/1), Methylmalonic aciduria(0/1), Isovaleric aciduria(2/1), 3-methylcrotonylglycineuria(1/0), Glutaric aciduria type 1(2/0)], 9 fatty acid oxidation disorders [LCHAD def. (2/2), Mitochondrial TFP def.(0/1), VLCAD def.(1/0), LC3KT def.(0/1), SCAD def (1/0), MADD def (0/1). The relatively normal development of 15 patients with metabolic disorders among newborns (except for the expired) demonstrates the usefulness of newborn screening by MS/MS for early diagnosis and medical intervention. However, close coordination between the MS/MS screening laboratory and the metabolic clinic/biochemical geneticists is needed to determine proper decision of screening parameters, confirmation diagnosis, follow-up scheme and additional tests."
15498248,"OBJECTIVE: To understand the trend of incidence of omphalocele and its epidemiological characteristics in China during 1996 to 2000. METHODS: Surveillance data of omphalocele were collected from 460 hospitals at county level or above county level, involving all births with 28-week gestation to 7 days after delivery, including live births, fetal deaths and stillbirths in 31 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities all over the country during 1996 to 2000. RESULTS: Overall incidence of omphalocele in China was 1.52 per 10 000 live births, with an increasing trend during 1996 to 2000. Incidence of omphalocele was 1.40 per 10 000 and 1.83 per 10 000 in the rural and urban areas, respectively, with a statistically significant difference (P < 0.05), and 1.54 per 10 000 and 1.41 per 10 000 in boys and girls, respectively. Babies of omphalocele associated with other malformation accounted for 30.77% of the total cases. Perinatal fatality rate of omphalocele was 51.18%, with prenatal diagnostic rate of 31.07%. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of omphalocele appeared an increasing trend in China during the period from 1996 to 2000. Occurrence of omphalocele was more frequent in rural areas than that in urban areas. Perinatal fatality rate in babies with omphalocele was higher and fatality of associated omphalocele was higher than that of simple one. It is suggested that management of perinatal care and level of prenatal diagnosis for omphalocele should be improved."
24585268,"Homozygous autosomal dominant hypercholesterolaemia (hoADH), an orphan disease caused by mutations in low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), apolipoprotein B (APOB), or proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9), is characterized by elevated plasma low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and high risk for premature cardiovascular disease (CVD). The exact prevalence of molecularly defined hoADH is unknown. Therefore, we investigated the prevalence and phenotypical characteristics of this disease in an open society, i.e. the Netherlands.The database of the nationwide ADH molecular diagnostic center was queried to identify all molecularly defined hoADH patients. Carriers of non-pathogenic mutations were excluded. Medical records were analysed for data regarding lipid levels and CVD events. Of 104,682 individuals screened for molecular defects, 49 were classified as hoADH (0.05%); 20 were true homozygotes, 25 were compound heterozygotes for LDLR mutations, and 4 were homozygous for APOB mutations. No bi-allelic PCSK9 mutation carriers were identified. Consequently, the prevalence of hoADH was estimated to be ∼1 : 300,000. Mean LDL-C levels prior to lipid-lowering treatment were 12.9 ± 5.1 mmol/L (range 4.4-21.5 mmol/L). Surprisingly, only 50% of the patients met the clinical criteria for hoADH (LDL-C >13.0 mmol/L); 29% of patients suffered from a CVD event.The prevalence of molecularly defined hoADH is much higher and the clinical phenotype is more variable than previously assumed. In light of the fact that novel therapies are, or will be registered for the treatment of hoADH patients, an uniform definition of hoADH either as a phenotypic or molecular entity is warranted in order to identify patients who are considered to be eligible for these novel agents."
11549642,"Androgen insensitivity syndrome encompasses a wide range of phenotypes, which are caused by numerous different mutations in the AR gene. Detailed information on the genotype/phenotype relationship in androgen insensitivity syndrome is important for sex assignment, treatment of androgen insensitivity syndrome patients, genetic counseling of their families, and insight into the functional domains of the AR. The commonly accepted concept of dependence on fetal androgens of the development of Wolffian ducts was studied in complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS) patients. In a nationwide survey in The Netherlands, all cases (n = 49) with the presumptive diagnosis androgen insensitivity syndrome known to pediatric endocrinologists and clinical geneticists were studied. After studying the clinical phenotype, mutation analysis and functional analysis of mutant receptors were performed using genital skin fibroblasts and in vitro expression studies. Here we report the findings in families with multiple affected cases. Fifty-nine percent of androgen insensitivity syndrome patients had other affected relatives. A total of 17 families were studied, seven families with CAIS (18 patients), nine families with partial androgen insensitivity (24 patients), and one family with female prepubertal phenotypes (two patients). No phenotypic variation was observed in families with CAIS. However, phenotypic variation was observed in one-third of families with partial androgen insensitivity resulting in different sex of rearing and differences in requirement of reconstructive surgery. Intrafamilial phenotypic variation was observed for mutations R846H, M771I, and deletion of amino acid N682. Four newly identified mutations were found. Follow-up in families with different AR gene mutations provided information on residual androgen action in vivo and the development of the prepubertal and adult phenotype. Patients with a functional complete defective AR had some pubic hair, Tanner stage P2, and vestigial Wolffian duct derivatives despite absence of AR expression. Vaginal length was functional in most but not all CAIS patients. The minimal incidence of androgen insensitivity syndrome in The Netherlands, based on patients with molecular proof of the diagnosis is 1:99,000. Phenotypic variation was absent in families with CAIS, but distinct phenotypic variation was observed relatively frequent in families with partial androgen insensitivity. Molecular observations suggest that phenotypic variation had different etiologies among these families. Sex assignment of patients with partial androgen insensitivity cannot be based on a specific identified AR gene mutation because distinct phenotypic variation in partial androgen insensitivity families is relatively frequent. In genetic counseling of partial androgen insensitivity families, this frequent occurrence of variable expression resulting in differences in sex of rearing and/or requirement of reconstructive surgery is important information. During puberty or normal dose androgen therapy, no or only minimal virilization may occur even in patients with significant (but still deficient) prenatal virilization. Wolffian duct remnants remain detectable but differentiation does not occur in the absence of a functional AR. In many CAIS patients, surgical elongation of the vagina is not indicated."
12769508,"BACKGROUND: Define the pattern and birth prevalence of the different types of osteochondrodysplasias in newborn infants in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) population, which is highly inbred and where termination of pregnancy is not accepted. METHODS: All infants with a birth weight of 500 gm and above in the three hospitals in Al Ain Medical District of the UAE were studied prospectively over a period of 5 years. For each live birth or stillbirth with suspected skeletal dysplasia, a detailed clinical and radiological examination was carried out. Pregnancy history and information regarding parental age, ethnic origin, family history, and level of consanguinity were obtained and a pedigree was constructed. RESULTS: Among the 38,048 births during the study period, 36 (9.46/10,000 births) had some type of skeletal dysplasia. Eighteen cases were attributed to autosomal recessive genes (4.7/10,000 births), 10 were due to apparent new dominant mutations (2.62/10,000), five were autosomal dominant type (1.3/10,000) and one was X-linked dominant type (0.26/10,000). In three cases, inheritance was unknown. The most common recessive type of skeletal dysplasia in our series was fibrochondrogenesis (1.05/10,000), followed by chondrodysplasia punctata (0.78/10,000). The birth prevalence rate of skeletal dysplasia doubled in the last 2 years of the 5-year observation period (6.74/10,000 in 1996 vs. 12.86/10,000 in 1999, and 13.45/10,000 in 2000). This increase involved cases caused by new dominant mutations, and occurred mainly in the first half of 1999. CONCLUSION: This prospective study has identified a high birth prevalence of skeletal dysplasia, and risk factors are postulated. These findings represent an accurate birthprevalence figure and a useful baseline for this group of birth defects in the UAE."
20350330,"BACKGROUND: Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2C (LGMD2C) is an autosomal recessive muscle dystrophy that resembles Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Although DMD is known to affect one in every 3500 males regardless of race, a widespread founder mutation causing LGMD2C has been described in North Africa. However, the incidence of LGMD2C in Japanese has been unknown because the genetic background remains uncharacterized in many patients clinically diagnosed with DMD. METHODS: We enrolled 324 patients referred to the Kobe University Hospital with suspected DMD. Mutations in the dystrophin or the SGCG genes were analyzed using not only genomic DNA but also cDNA. RESULTS: In 322 of the 324 patients, responsible mutations in the dystrophin were successfully revealed, confirming DMD diagnosis. The remaining two patients had normal dystrophin expression but absence of gamma-sarcoglycan in skeletal muscle. Mutation analysis of the SGCG gene revealed homozygous deletion of exon 6 in one patient, while the other had a novel single nucleotide insertion in exon 7 in one allele and deletion of exon 6 in the other allele. These mutations created a stop codon that led to a gamma-sarcoglycan deficiency, and we therefore diagnosed these two patients as having LGMD2C. Thus, the relative incidence of LGMD2C among Japanese DMD-like patients can be calculated as 1 in 161 patients suspected to have DMD (2 of 324 patients = 0.6%). Taking into consideration the DMD incidence for the overall population (1/3,500 males), the incidence of LGMD2C can be estimated as 1 per 560,000 or 1.8 per million. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate a low incidence of LGMD2C in the Japanese population."
15868585,"BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: The introduction of laparoscope and transanal endorectal pull-through has caused a revolution in the operative procedures for Hirschsprung's disease. To study the changing profile of Hirschsprung's disease in Japan, the authors carried out a national survey. METHOD: Patient data were collected in 3 phases: group 1, 1628 patients between 1978 and 1982; group 2, 1121 patients between 1988 and 1992; and group 3, 1103 patients between 1998 and 2002, respectively. RESULTS: The incidence was 1:4697, 1:5544, and 1:5343 and the male/female ratio was 3.0:1, 3.4:1, and 3.0:1 in each group, respectively. Patients weighing less than 2500 g at birth increased to 10.4% in group 3, whereas they were 6.5% in group 2 and 5.5% in group 1. The patients with a family history also increased to 6.0% in group 3, in comparison with 2.8% in group 2 and 3.0% in group 1. The incidence of associated anomalies increased over time, 11.1% in group 1, 16.3% in group 2, and 21.2% in group 3. Mutations of genes were found in 4 of the 23 patients examined. The extent of aganglionosis was almost the same in each group. Regarding the definitive operation, the procedures without laparotomy, including transanal endorectal pull-through, increased up to 42.6% in group 3 but 0% in groups 1 and 2. The frequency that a primary operation without stoma was performed also increased. The age at definitive operation decreased in group 3. The incidence of preoperative and postoperative enterocolitis also decreased over time. The mortality was decreased over time, 7.1%, 4.9%, and 3.0% for groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The authors analyzed 3852 Japanese patients over 3 decades. The ratio of patients with a low birth weight, associated anomalies, or a family history was increased in the last 10 years. A primary operation without laparotomy has thus become the procedure of choice for a definitive operation."
20004511,"OBJECTIVE: The epidemiology of Moyamoya disease in mainland China has not been documented. Therefore, the present study was designed to examine the epidemiological and clinical features of Moyamoya disease in Nanjing, a provincial capital in China. METHODS: Patient records from multiple hospitals in Nanjing from January 2000 to December 2007 were collected. The clinical features of Moyamoya disease were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 202 patients were identified. There were 94 males and 108 females, with ages ranging from 2 to 78 years. There was a dual age peak, one in the group of patients 5-9 years of age and another in the group of patients 35-39 years of age. The initial symptoms included cerebral ischemia (81 patients, 40%), cerebral hemorrhage (113 patients, 55.9%) and asymptomatic disease (8 patients, 3.9%). An increasing incidence rate of Moyamoya disease was observed during the period of 2000-2007, with an average detection rate of 0.43cases/100,000 persons/year (prevalence 3.92/100,000 persons). The incidence of ischemia associated with the disease was 0.16cases/100,000 people-years and the incidence of hemorrhage was 0.22cases/100,000 people-years. CONCLUSION: This first study on the epidemiological and clinical features of Moyamoya disease in mainland China indicated an increasing incidence of Moyamoya disease with bimodal incidence distribution appearing more frequently in adults."
24986830,"Osteochondrodysplasias represent a large group of developmental structural disorders that can be caused by mutations in a variety of genes responsible for chondrocyte development, differentiation, mineralization and early ossification. The application of whole-exome sequencing to disorders apparently segregating as Mendelian traits has proven to be an effective approach to disease gene identification for conditions with unknown molecular etiology. We identified a homozygous missense variant p.(Gly697Arg) in COL27A1, in a family with Steel syndrome and no consanguinity. Interestingly, the identified variant seems to have arisen as a founder mutation in the Puerto Rican population."
18284672,"Monosomy 18p refers to a chromosomal disorder resulting from the deletion of all or part of the short arm of chromosome 18. The incidence is estimated to be about 1:50,000 live-born infants. In the commonest form of the disorder, the dysmorphic syndrome is very moderate and non-specific. The main clinical features are short stature, round face with short philtrum, palpebral ptosis and large ears with detached pinnae. Intellectual deficiency is mild to moderate. A small subset of patients, about 10-15 percent of cases, present with severe brain/facial malformations evocative of holoprosencephaly spectrum disorders. In two-thirds of the cases, the 18p- syndrome is due to a mere terminal deletion occurring de novo, in one-third the following are possible: a de novo translocation with loss of 18p, malsegregation of a parental translocation or inversion, or a ring chr18. Parental transmission of the 18p- syndrome has been reported. Cytogenetic analysis is necessary to make a definite diagnosis. Recurrence risk for siblings is low in de novo deletions and translocations, but is significant if a parental rearrangement is present. Deletion 18p can be detected prenatally by amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling and cytogenetic testing. Differential diagnosis may include a wide number of syndromes with short stature and mild intellectual deficiency. In young children, deletion 18p syndrome may be vaguely evocative of either Turner syndrome or trisomy 21. No specific treatment exists but speech therapy and early educational programs may help to improve the performances of the children. Except for the patients with severe brain malformations, the life expectancy does not seem significantly reduced."
22377708,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Previous studies have reported a prevalence estimate of myasthenia gravis (MG) from 7.7 to 11.1 per 100,000 inhabitants in Europe. Moreover, the study of the geographical distribution of MG should be useful to generate specific hypotheses. The aims are to estimate MG prevalence and to investigate its geographical variation in a delimited area in Northern Italy. METHODS: The primary source of data was the MG database of the Neurological Institute of Pavia and all other sources of case collection in and outside the province. We adopted a Bayesian approach to analyze MG geographical variation within the finest geographical grid. RESULTS: We identified 119 live MG prevalent cases resident in the province of Pavia on December 31, 2008. The overall crude prevalence was 24 per 100,000 inhabitants. The Bayesian analysis identified a small cluster of higher MG prevalence in the northern area of the province. CONCLUSIONS: The estimated MG prevalence sets the province of Pavia among the high-risk areas. The identification of high/low MG risk areas deserves further investigation of genetic and environmental factors possibly related to a major risk of the disease in that area."
21689452,"BACKGROUND:National newborn screening programmes based on tandem-mass spectrometry (MS/MS) and other newborn screening (NBS) technologies show a substantial variation in number and types of disorders included in the screening panel. Once established, these methods offer the opportunity to extend newborn screening panels without significant investment and cost. However, systematic evaluations of newborn screening programmes are rare, most often only describing parts of the whole process from taking blood samples to long-term evaluation of outcome. METHODS:In a prospective single screening centre observational study 373 cases with confirmed diagnosis of a metabolic disorder from a total cohort of 1,084,195 neonates screened in one newborn screening laboratory between January 1, 1999, and June 30, 2009 and subsequently treated and monitored in five specialised centres for inborn errors of metabolism were examined. Process times for taking screening samples, obtaining results, initiating diagnostic confirmation and starting treatment as well as the outcome variables metabolic decompensations, clinical status, and intellectual development at a mean age of 3.3 years were evaluated. RESULTS:Optimal outcome is achieved especially for the large subgroup of patients with medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency. Kaplan-Meier-analysis revealed disorder related patterns of decompensation. Urea cycle disorders, organic acid disorders, and amino acid disorders show an early high and continuous risk, medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency a continuous but much lower risk for decompensation, other fatty acid oxidation disorders an intermediate risk increasing towards the end of the first year. Clinical symptoms seem inevitable in a small subgroup of patients with very early disease onset. Later decompensation can not be completely prevented despite pre-symptomatic start of treatment. Metabolic decompensation does not necessarily result in impairment of intellectual development, but there is a definite association between the two. CONCLUSIONS:Physical and cognitive outcome in patients with presymptomatic diagnosis of metabolic disorders included in the current German screening panel is equally good as in phenylketonuria, used as a gold standard for NBS. Extended NBS entails many different interrelated variables which need to be carefully evaluated and optimized. More reports from different parts of the world are needed to allow a comprehensive assessment of the likely benefits, harms and costs in different populations."
23842438,"BACKGROUND: Medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD) is the most common inherited defect in the mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation pathway, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality in undiagnosed patients.Newborn screening (NBS) has considerably improved MCADD outcome, but the risk of complication remains in some patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between genotype, biochemical parameters and clinical data at diagnosis and during follow-up, in order to optimize monitoring of these patients. METHODS: We carried out a multicenter study in southwest Europe, of MCADD patients detected by NBS. Evaluated NBS data included free carnitine (C0) and the acylcarnitines C8, C10, C10:1 together with C8/C2 and C8/C10 ratios, clinical presentation parameters and genotype, in 45 patients. Follow-up data included C0 levels, duration of carnitine supplementation and occurrence of metabolic crises. RESULTS: C8/C2 ratio and C8 were the most accurate biomarkers of MCADD in NBS. We found a high number of patients homozygous for the prevalent c.985A > G mutation (75%). Moreover, in these patients C8, C8/C10 and C8/C2 were higher than in patients with other genotypes, while median value of C0 was significantly lower (23 μmol/L vs 36 μmol/L).The average follow-up period was 43 months. To keep carnitine levels within the normal range, carnitine supplementation was required in 82% of patients, and for a longer period in patients homozygotes for the c.985A>G mutation than in patients with other genotypes (average 31 vs 18 months). Even with treatment, median C0 levels remained lower in homozygous patients than in those with other genotypes (14 μmol/L vs 22 μmol/L).Two patients died and another three suffered a metabolic crisis, all of whom were homozygous for the c.985 A>G mutation. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show a direct association between homozygosity for c.985A>G and lower carnitine values at diagnosis, and a higher dose of carnitine supplementation for maintenance within the normal range. This study contributes to a better understanding of the relationship between genotype and phenotype in newborn patients with MCADD detected through screening which could be useful in improving follow-up strategies and clinical outcome."
21944556,"A study of aggregate data collected from the literature and official sources was undertaken to estimate expected and observed prevalence of Trypanosoma cruzi infection, annual incidence of congenital transmission and rate of underdiagnosis of Chagas disease among Latin American migrants in the nine European countries with the highest prevalence of Chagas disease. Formal and informal data sources were used to estimate the population from endemic countries resident in Europe in 2009, diagnosed cases of Chagas disease and births from mothers originating from endemic countries. By 2009, 4,290 cases had been diagnosed in Europe, compared with an estimated 68,000 to 122,000 expected cases. The expected prevalence was very high in undocumented migrants (on average 45% of total expected cases) while the observed prevalence rate was 1.3 cases per 1,000 resident migrants from endemic countries. An estimated 20 to 183 babies with congenital Chagas disease are born annually in the study countries. The annual incidence rate of congenital transmission per 1,000 pregnancies in women from endemic countries was between none and three cases. The index of under diagnosis of T. cruzi infection was between 94% and 96%. Chagas disease is a public health challenge in the studied European countries. Urgent measures need to be taken to detect new cases of congenital transmission and take care of the existing cases with a focus on migrants without legal residency permit and potential difficulty accessing care."
10954251,"Most individuals with AAT deficiency have escaped detection by healthcare systems worldwide. The large number of undiagnosed individuals has made it difficult to define the natural history of the clinical disease accurately, and severe ascertainment bias has colored the clinical descriptions of the disease. Most importantly, undetected individuals lose opportunities for important lifestyle changes and preventive therapies. To address this problem, the World Health Organization has recommended that all patients with chronic obstructive lung disease, and all adults and adolescents with asthma, be tested for AAT deficiency. Historically, the AAT Deficiency Detection Center has tested more than 30 000 individuals for the disease, and we have identified more than 1000 cases of AAT deficiency (approximately 30% of the known cases in the United States). Currently, we are implementing methods for determining AAT concentration (level), phenotype, and genotype in specimens of whole blood dried onto filter paper. This full spectrum of robust tests is performed on samples that are easily obtained and shipped to a central laboratory for processing. Wide application of these procedures may help to bring large numbers of presently undiagnosed patients to medical attention."
30556349,"Autosomal recessive PRUNE1 mutations are reported to cause a severe neurodevelopmental disorder with microcephaly, hypotonia, and brain malformations. We describe clinical and neuropathological features in a cohort of nine individuals of Cree descent who, because of a founder effect, are homozygous for the same PRUNE1 mutation. They follow the course of a combined neuromuscular and neurodegenerative disease, rather than a pure failure of normal development. This cohort presented in infancy with features of lower motor neuron disease, such as hypotonia, contractures, tongue fasciculations, and feeding difficulties in the absence of congenital brain anomalies and microcephaly. A neurodegenerative course followed with onset of seizures, spasticity, and respiratory insufficiency. Muscle biopsies showed denervation/reinnervation features, nonspecific atrophy and end-stage atrophy. Autopsy findings in two patients are also described, suggesting length dependent central motor axon degeneration, peripheral motor axon degeneration, possible spinal motor neuron degeneration, and accumulation of beta amyloid precursor protein inclusions in select brainstem nuclei. Exome sequencing and homozygosity mapping identified a homozygous PRUNE1 mutation in a canonical splice site, which produces two abnormal PRUNE1 mRNA products. Based on our studies and the histopathology and phenotypic data, we provide further evidence that this disorder leads to a neurodegenerative disease affecting both the peripheral and central nervous systems and suggest that the pathogenic c.521-2A>G mutation could lead to an altered effect on tubulin dynamics."
17620156,"Oculocutaneous albinism type II (OCA2), the most common form of albinism worldwide, is prevalent throughout sub-Saharan Africa. The hypopigmentory phenotype distinguishes affected individuals as 'different' in a black population, resulting in problems of social acceptance and integration. Health issues include constant, lifelong sun-induced skin damage and poor vision. This study determined the frequency and distribution of albinism among the Vhavenda ethnic group living in the relatively low-income north of South Africa in a clan-oriented society. A retrospective study of birth records from regional hospitals gave an incidence of OCA of 1 in 1970, whereas a survey of mainstream schools gave a frequency of only one pupil with albinism in 13,319 as most affected children attended the regional special school. A community-based field study of 35 rural villages gave a prevalence of 1 in 2239 for OCA. One clan, the Vhatavhatsindi, had a significantly higher frequency of 1 in 832. This epidemiological study provides the necessary data for developing health care and welfare system for families affected by albinism in this region."
19720631,"Determining the prevalence of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) in different populations has proved difficult, with estimates varying between one in 4000 to one in 40,000. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of PCD in a well-defined highly consanguineous Asian population in the UK. Over a 15-year period all patients suspected of having PCD in the Asian population of Bradford, UK, were tested by measurement of ciliary beat pattern, frequency and electron microscopy. The prevalence of PCD in the population studied was one in 2265. 52% of the patients' parents were first cousins. All patients had a history of chronic cough and nasal symptoms from the first year of life. 73% had a history of neonatal respiratory distress. Clinical suspicion of PCD should be high in populations in which it is possible that high levels of consanguinity may result in an increase in those with PCD. In these communities the combination of chronic cough and nasal symptoms should prompt early diagnostic testing."
9598722,"An epidemiological and genetic investigation of myotonia congenita was carried out in northern Finland. Altogether 58 patients were identified (of whom 54 lived in the study area) in 23 families, with a prevalence of 7.3 per 100000. The majority of the families originated from a sparsely populated area in western Lapland. The mean age at onset of the disease was 11 years with a range of 2 to 45 years. The mean time that had passed before verification of the clinical disease was 18 (SD 14) years. The sex ratio M/F was 2.2/1.0. Forty-seven cases were familial and 11 were sporadic. In six families/pedigrees the inheritance was compatible with autosomal recessive and in two families with autosomal dominant inheritance. In five additional families, in which autosomal recessive inheritance seemed most plausible, vertical transmission was also noticed. This could be explained either by consanguinity of the parents or by variant expression of the mutation(s) involved. Our results suggest that myotonia congenita is unusually frequent in northern Finland, most probably as a consequence of an enrichment of the gene mutation(s) in the population."
20499044,"Maturity-onset diabetes of the young is frequently misdiagnosed as type 1 or type 2 diabetes. A correct diagnosis of MODY is important for determining treatment, but can only be confirmed by molecular genetic testing. We aimed to compare the regional distribution of confirmed MODY cases in the UK and to estimate the minimum prevalence.UK referrals for genetic testing in 2,072 probands and 1,280 relatives between 1996 and 2009 were examined by region, country and test result. Referral rate and prevalence were calculated using UK Census 2001 figures.MODY was confirmed in 1,177 (35%) patients, with HNF1A (52%) and GCK mutations (32%) being most frequent in probands confirmed with MODY. There was considerable regional variation in proband referral rates (from <20 per million in Wales and Northern Ireland to >50 per million for South West England and Scotland) and patients diagnosed with MODY (5.3 per million in Northern Ireland, 48.9 per million in South West England). Referral rates and confirmed cases were highly correlated (r = 0.96, p < 0.0001). The minimum prevalence of MODY was estimated to be 108 cases per million.Assuming this minimal prevalence throughout the UK then >80% of MODY is not diagnosed by molecular testing. The marked regional variation in the prevalence of confirmed MODY directly results from differences in referral rates. This could reflect variation in awareness of MODY or unequal access to genetic testing. Increased referral for diagnostic testing is required if the majority of MODY patients are to have the genetic diagnosis necessary for optimal treatment."
22534879,"Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is an important disease with significant complications. The objectives of this study were to determine incidence and mortality of PG and strength of reported associations. A retrospective cohort study was completed using computerized medical records from the General Practice Research Database, a large representative UK database. Patients with PG and three groups of age-, sex-, and practice-matched controls--general population, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) controls--were included in the study. Incidence and mortality were determined and validation undertaken to inform diagnostic accuracy. In all there were 313 people with the median age of 59 (interquartile range 41-72) years, and of them 185 (59%) were female. The adjusted incidence rate standardized to European standard population was 0.63 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57-0.71) per 100,000 person-years. The risk of death was three times higher than that for general controls (adjusted hazard ratio=3.03, 95% CI 1.84-4.73, P<0.001), 72% higher than that for IBD controls (adjusted hazard ratio=1.72, 95% CI 1.17-2.59, P=0.013), with a borderline increase compared with RA controls (adjusted hazard ratio=1.55, 95% CI 1.01-2.37, P=0.045). Disease associations were present in 110 (33%) participants: IBD, n=67 (20.2%); RA, n=39 (11.8%); and hematological disorders, n=13 (3.9%). To our knowledge, there are no previous population-based studies of the epidemiology of PG, an important disease with significantly increased mortality."
24387641,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Large population-based studies are much needed to accurately establish the epidemiology of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). We aimed to collect all PBC patients in a geographically defined area to evaluate the epidemiology of PBC and examine the possible association of PBC with smoking, age at menarche, age at first pregnancy and number of pregnancies. METHODS: All PBC patients between 2000 and 2008 were identified in a geographically defined area of the Netherlands, comprising 50% of the Dutch population. Four independent hospital databases were searched in 44 hospitals. Medical records were reviewed on site verifying diagnosis and for collection of clinical data. Age- and gender matched controls were recruited from the outpatient clinics of four participating hospitals. Patients and controls were asked to fill out a questionnaire regarding family history, previous and current smoking behaviour and fertility status. RESULTS: Nine hundred and ninety-two PBC patients fulfilled all inclusion criteria, resulting in a mean incidence of 1.1 per 100 000; 0.3 in men and 1.9 in women. On January 1st 2008 the point prevalence was 13.2 per 100 000 inhabitants. Incidence and prevalence rates were increasing over time (P < 0.001). No geographical differences in disease distribution were observed. Smoking behaviour, age at menarche, age at first pregnancy, gravidity and number of children were not significantly different between cases and controls. CONCLUSION: Incidence and prevalence rates of PBC are increasing over time. PBC was not found to be associated with smoking, age at menarche, age at first pregnancy or number of pregnancies."
11967035,"BACKGROUND: Congenital solitary kidneys, which are susceptible to renal failure, have been considered mostly due to unilateral renal agenesis and partly due to renal aplasia. Risk of familial recurrence and of other associated anomalies is known to be much higher in renal agenesis than in renal aplasia. However, differential diagnosis between the two renal anomalies is difficult, and renal agenesis has been found much less frequently in ultrasound screening studies of fetuses than in autopsy studies. METHODS: In order to investigate the nature and incidence of the congenital solitary kidney, the present study performed ultrasound screening of the kidneys in 4000 newborn babies. A diagnosis of renal agenesis was made when ultrasound identified no renal parenchyma and renoscintigraphy showed no renal function, and renal aplasia when there was a renal parenchyma without any function. RESULTS: Primary screening detected 52 babies suspected of having small kidneys and one baby with a multicystic dysplastic kidney, but no baby with renal agenesis. Forty-seven of the 53 babies underwent a second ultrasound scanning at one month of age. Three small kidneys in three babies further decreased in size, had no function and were diagnosed as renal aplasia (which has an incidence rate of one in 1300). Follow-up ultrasound studies showed further regression in all three, which became very hard to distinguish by one year of age. CONCLUSIONS: The present study showed that ultrasound in the neonatal period could identify the aplastic kidney, which had a reniform shape, not rudimentary, during the newborn period, and regressed rapidly thereafter. These findings indicate that most renal agenesis diagnosed clinically thus far might more correctly be renal aplasia."
15183409,"This article describes a pooled analysis of Korean individuals with nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS). The data upon which this review is based has been retrieved from published case reports in Korean dental and medical literature between the years 1981 to 2002. We found 33 subjects who met the diagnostic criteria for NBCCS. Relative frequencies of associated complications are presented and compared with those of the English literature. Odontogenic keratocyst (OKC) and palmar and/or plantar pits, and hypertelorism were the most frequently observed anomalies. OKCs are often the first signs of NBCCS and can be detected in patients younger than 20 years of age. However, the incidence and clinical manifestations of NBCCS in Korean individuals were found to be rather different from those of other countries. The relatively low frequency of basal cell carcinomas and falx calcification among the major criteria were two major differences. The frequencies of the minor criteria concur in general with the ranges given by some others. It is concluded that these differences may be attributed to genetic and geographic differences."
18614511,"OBJECTIVE:To determine the incidence of and mortality from bullous pemphigoid and pemphigus vulgaris in the United Kingdom. DESIGN:Retrospective historical cohort study. SETTING:Computerised medical records from the health improvement network, a large population based UK general practice database. PARTICIPANTS:Patients with pemphigus vulgaris and bullous pemphigoid diagnostic codes and age, sex, and practice matched controls. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:Incidence and mortality compared with the control population by calendar period, age group, sex, geographical region, and degree of social deprivation. RESULTS:869 people with bullous pemphigoid and 138 people with pemphigus vulgaris were identified. The median age at presentation for bullous pemphigoid was 80 (range 23-102) years, and 534 (61%) patients were female. The median age at presentation for pemphigus vulgaris was 71 (21-102) years, and 91 (66%) patients were female. Incidences of bullous pemphigoid and pemphigus vulgaris were 4.3 (95% confidence interval 4.0 to 4.6) and 0.7 (0.6 to 0.8) per 100 000 person years. The incidence of bullous pemphigoid increased over time; the average yearly increase was 17% (incidence rate ratio=1.2, 95% confidence interval 1.1 to 1.2). An average yearly increase in incidence of pemphigus vulgaris of 11% (incidence rate ratio=1.1, 1.0 to 1.2) occurred. The risk of death for patients with bullous pemphigoid was twice as great as for controls (adjusted hazard ratio=2.3, 95% confidence interval 2.0 to 2.7). For pemphigus vulgaris, the risk of death was three times greater than for controls (adjusted hazard ratio=3.3, 2.2 to 5.2). CONCLUSIONS:Incidences of bullous pemphigoid and pemphigus vulgaris are increasing. The reasons for the changes in incidence are not clearly understood but have implications for identifying causative factors. Both disorders are associated with a high risk of death. Previous estimates may have underestimated the risk of death associated with these diseases."
12598399,"This is the first population based study to estimate the birth prevalence of DNA proven Prader-Willi syndrome. Thirty infants were reported to the Australian Paediatric Surveillance Unit between 1998 and 2000, a prevalence of 4 per 100,000 live births or approximately 1/25,000 live births per annum."
7793232,"INTRODUCTION:a study was conducted in the Valle d'Aosta Region, Italy, (115270 inhabitants) to determine the prevalence of hereditary ataxias (HA) and hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSP), and the degree of disability they cause. METHODS:we identified all patients with suspected HA or HSP referred from 1981 to 1991 to in- and out-patient departments, EEG, EMG, and CT-scan services, and centres for the handicapped. Harding's criteria were followed for diagnosis and classification. RESULTS:at the prevalence day, 17 patients were alive, with a prevalence ratio of 14.8/100,000 population. There were 2 cases of Friedreich's ataxia (FA), 1 of early onset cerebellar ataxia with retained tendon reflexes (EOCA), 1 of autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia (ADCA), 8 of sporadic idiopathic late onset cerebellar ataxias, and 5 of HSP. CONCLUSIONS:epidemiological studies on HA and HSP show highly variable prevalence ratios, which could be due in part to the inclusion of sporadic cases. FA, EOCA and ADCA have similar prevalence ratios in most studies."
23061066,"BACKGROUND:Esophageal adenocarcinoma has one of the fastest rising incidence rates and one of the lowest survival rates of any cancer type in the Western world. However, in many countries, trends in esophageal cancer differ according to tumour morphology and anatomical location. In Canada, incidence and survival trends for esophageal cancer subtypes are poorly known. METHODS:Cancer incidence and mortality rates were obtained from the Canadian Cancer Registry, the National Cancer Incidence Reporting System and the Canadian Vital Statistics Death databases for the period from 1986 to 2006. Observed trends (annual per cent change) and five-year relative survival ratios were estimated separately for esophageal adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, and according to location (upper, middle, or lower one-third of the esophagus). Incidence rates were projected up to the year 2026. RESULTS:Annual age-standardized incidence rates for esophageal cancer in 2004 to 2006 were 6.1 and 1.7 per 100,000 for males and females, respectively. Esophageal adenocarcinoma incidence rose by 3.9% (males) and 3.6% (females) per year for the period 1986 to 2006, with the steepest increase in the lower one-third of the esophagus (4.8% and 5.0% per year among males and females, respectively). In contrast, squamous cell carcinoma incidence declined by 3.3% (males) and 3.2% (females) per year since the early 1990s. The five-year relative survival ratio for esophageal cancer was 13% between 2004 and 2006, approximately a 3% increase since the period from 1992 to 1994. Projected incidence rates showed increases of 40% to 50% for esophageal adenocarcinoma and decreases of 30% for squamous cell carcinoma by 2026. DISCUSSION:Although esophageal cancer is rare in Canada, the incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma has doubled in the past 20 years, which may reflect the increasing prevalence of obesity and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Declines in squamous cell carcinoma may be the result of the decreases in the prevalence of smoking in Canada. Given the low survival rates and the potential for further increases in incidence, esophageal adenocarcinoma warrants close attention."
23059950,"Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) is a congenital multiple anomaly/intellectual disability syndrome caused by a deficiency of cholesterol synthesis resulting from a deficiency of 7-dehydrocholesterol (7DHC) reductase encoded by DHCR7. SLOS is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. It is characterized by prenatal and postnatal growth retardation, microcephaly, a variable degree of intellectual disability that encompasses normal intelligence to severe intellectual deficiency, and multiple major and minor malformations. External malformations include distinctive facial features, cleft palate, postaxial polydactyly, 2-3 syndactyly of the toes, and underdeveloped external genitalia in males, while internal anomalies may affect every organ system. The clinical spectrum is wide, and rare individuals have been described with normal development and only minor malformations. The clinical diagnosis of SLOS is confirmed by demonstrating an abnormally elevated concentration of the cholesterol precursor, 7DHC, in serum or other tissues, or by the presence of two DHCR7 mutations. The enzymatic deficiency results in decreased cholesterol and increased 7DHC levels, both during embryonic development and after birth. The malformations found in SLOS may result from decreased cholesterol, increased 7DHC or a combination of these two factors. This review discusses the physical and behavioral phenotype of SLOS, the diagnostic approaches, the natural history from the prenatal period to adulthood, and current understanding of the pathophysiology of SLOS."
7890895,"The incidence of primary sclerosing cholangitis has been estimated on the basis of its frequent association with ulcerative colitis, but direct epidemiologic studies have not yet been carried out. In the current study we report a survey of clinical and epidemiological aspects of primary sclerosing cholangitis in Spain. A questionnaire was circulated to physicians in 33 hospitals throughout Spain to ascertain the number and the clinical, biochemical and immunologic characteristics of patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis from January 1, 1984 to December 31, 1988. Twenty-three centers, from 12 Spanish regions, covering a population of 19.23 million answered the questionnaire. Forty-three patients (60.5% males) with a mean age of 42.3 years (range 12 to 75 years) were seen during the 5-year period. At presentation, 16% of the cases were asymptomatic. Ulcerative colitis was present in 44.2% of cases, and one patient had Crohn's disease. The overall annual incidence ranged from 0.16 to 0.68 cases/million from 1985 to 1988, and the annual prevalence increased from 0.78 cases/million in 1984 to 2.24 cases/million in 1988. No geographical differences were found, but there was a trend to detect more cases in industrialized regions. In conclusion, there was a continuing rise in the annual incidence and prevalence of primary sclerosing cholangitis in Spain over a 5-year period."
8692238,"Recently, a cluster of patients was observed in France in whom primary pulmonary hypertension developed in patients exposed to derivatives of fenfluramine in appetite suppressants (anorexic agents), which are used for weight control. We investigated the potential role of anorexic agents and other suspected risk factors for primary pulmonary hypertension.In a case-control study, we assessed 95 patients with primary pulmonary hypertension from 35 centers in France, Belgium, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands and 355 controls recruited from general practices and matched to the patients' sex and age.The use of anorexic drugs (mainly derivatives of fenfluramine) was associated with an increased risk of primary pulmonary hypertension (odds ratio with any anorexic-drug use, 6.3; 95 percent confidence interval, 3.0 to 13.2). For the use of anorexic agents in the preceding year, the odds ratio was 10.1 (95 percent confidence interval, 3.4 to 29.9). When anorexic drugs were used to a total of more than three months, the odds ratio was 23.1 (95 percent confidence interval, 6.9 to 77.7). We also confirmed an association with several previously identified risk factors: a family history of pulmonary hypertension, infection with the human immunodeficiency virus, cirrhosis, and use of cocaine or intravenous drugs.The use of anorexic drugs was associated with the development of primary pulmonary hypertension. Active surveillance for this disease should be considered, particularly since their use is expected to increase in the near future."
21465650,"Ebstein anomaly is a rare but serious cardiac defect, however, little is known about the etiology of this condition. The goal of this study was to expand our limited understanding of the epidemiology of Ebstein anomaly. Data for cases with Ebstein anomaly, as well as all live births, were obtained from the Texas Birth Defects Registry (TBDR) and Center for Health Statistics for the period 1999-2005. Descriptive analyses and estimates of birth prevalence and crude prevalence ratios were used to characterize this defect in Texas during the study period. There were 188 definite cases of Ebstein anomaly identified in the TBDR. The overall prevalence was 0.72 per 10,000 live births. Variables associated with an increased prevalence of non-syndromic Ebstein anomaly included: maternal age >39 years (compared to those 20-24 years), maternal residence along the Texas-Mexico border (compared to non-border residence), and conception in fall or winter (compared to summer). In addition, infants with Ebstein anomaly were at a greater risk of preterm birth and being small for gestational age. These findings help to define subgroups of women at increased risk of having offspring affected by Ebstein anomaly. Furthermore, our findings add to the limited body of literature on this rare but serious malformation."
17699321,"Clinicoepidemiological manifestations of the vasculitides differ geographically. According to a nationwide, hospital-based survey in Japan, the prevalence of microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) and/or renal-limited vasculitis (RLV) is much higher than that of Wegener's granulomatosis (WG). However, little is known about the incidence of antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (ANCA)-associated primary renal vasculitis (PRV) in Japan. The incidence of PRV was retrospectively determined by a population-based method in Miyazaki Prefecture in Japan between 2000 and 2004. PRV was defined according to the following criteria from the European Systemic Vasculitis Study Group: (1) new patients with WG, MPA, Churg-Strauss syndrome (CSS), or RLV, (2) renal involvement attributable to active vasculitis, and (3) ANCA considered positive if the disease was not histologically confirmed. The numbers of patients with PRV in the years 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2004 were 9, 9, 9, 16, and 13, respectively. The male to female ratio was 24:32 and the average age was 70.4 +/- 10.9 (mean +/- SD) yr. The estimated annual incidence of PRV was 14.8 (95% confidence interval [CI] 10.8 to 18.9) and 44.8 (95% CI 33.2 to 56.3) per million adults (>15 yr old) and seniors (>65 yr old), respectively. Ninety-one percent of the patients were myeloperoxidase (MPO)-ANCA positive, but none were positive for proteinase 3 (PR3)-ANCA. There were no WG or CSS patients. The incidence of PRV did not differ between Japan and Europe, but WG was not widespread in Japan. Furthermore, the ratio of serum MPO to PR3-ANCA among Japanese with PRV was much higher than that found among European and US patients."
10733998,"Over an 18-month period, all incident cases of neurological disorders were ascertained prospectively in an unselected urban population based in 13 general practices in the London area by a General Practice Linkage Scheme with the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery. In three of these practices, the lifetime prevalence of neurological disorders was also assessed. A population of 100 230 patients registered with participating general practices was followed prospectively for the onset of neurological disorders. Multiple methods of case finding were used to maintain accuracy. The age- and sex-adjusted incidence rates of neurological disorders were calculated. The lifetime prevalence of neurological disorders was surveyed in 27 658 of the patients. The age- and sex-adjusted incidence rates were calculated for major neurological conditions. [These are expressed as rates per 100 000 persons per annum, with 95% confidence intervals (CI) in parentheses]. The commonest of these were first cerebrovascular events, 205 (CI: 183, 230); shingles, 140 (CI: 104, 184); diabetic polyneuropathy, 54 (CI: 33, 83); compressive neuropathies, 49 (CI: 39, 61); epilepsy, 46 (CI: 36, 60); Parkinson's disease, 19 (CI: 12, 27); peripheral neuropathies, 15 (CI: 9, 23); CNS infections, 12 (CI: 5, 13); post-herpetic neuralgia, 11 (CI: 6, 17); and major neurological injuries, 10 (CI: 4, 11). Lifetime prevalence rates are also reported (expressed as rate per 1000 persons with 95% CI). The most prevalent conditions were: completed stroke, 9 (CI: 8, 11); transient ischaemic attacks, 5 (CI: 4, 6); active epilepsy, 4 (CI: 4, 5); congenital neurological deficit, 3 (CI: 3, 4); Parkinson's disease, 2 (CI: 1, 3); multiple sclerosis, 2 (CI: 2, 3); diabetic polyneuropathy, 2 (CI: 1, 3); compressive mononeuropathies, 2 (CI: 2, 3); and sub-arachnoid haemorrhage, 1 (CI: 0.8, 2). Overall, the onset of 625 neurological disorders was observed per 100 000 population annually. Six percent of the population had at some time had a neurological disorder. This is the first study of the incidence and lifetime prevalence of neurological disorders in recent times; we found that these disorders give rise to significant morbidity in the community."
10656214,"BACKGROUND:Relatively little attention has been given to the epidemiology and management of cancer of the ampulla of Vater. SETTING:A series of 111 patients with a cancer of the ampulla of Vater diagnosed over a 20-year period (1976-1995) in a well-defined French population was used to analyse its incidence, management and prognosis as well as to determine time trends. Prognosis was determined by using crude and relative survival rates. Factors predictive of survival were also identified using a relative survival model in a multivariate analysis. RESULTS:Age-standardized incidence rates were 3.8 per 1000000 inhabitants in men and 2.7 per 1000000 inhabitants in women. Incidence increased over time in men from 1.9 during the first period (1976-1980) to 5.9 during the last period (1991-1995). In women, incidence rates remained stable. A resection for cure was performed in 52 cases (48.1%). Overall, 9.9% of these cancers were classified TNM stage I and 54.1% stage IV. There was no significant variation in treatment modalities and in stage at diagnosis over the study period. The overall operative mortality rate was 7.5%. Relative survival rates were 58.9% at 1 year, 30.9% at 3 years and 20.9% at 5 years. Five-year relative survival rates varied from 72.8% in TNM stage I cancers to 6.6% in TNM stage IV cancers. Age, treatment procedure and stage at diagnosis significantly influenced the prognosis of cancer of the ampulla of Vater. In a multivariate analysis, stage at diagnosis remained the major prognostic factor (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS:Although its incidence is increasing in men, cancer of the ampulla of Vater remains a rare tumour in both sexes. No improvements in the management and care of patients have been achieved. Further studies are needed to enhance the understanding of this cancer."
21708407,"Population-based data on patients with MDS are scarce. Here we report the incidence and prevalence of MDS based on data from the Düsseldorf MDS Registry. Cases in the city of Düsseldorf in the study period were identified from the MDS Registry. We calculated crude, calendar-year, age- and sex-specific and European Standard Population age-standardized incidence rates as well as point prevalences per 100,000 The crude incidence rate was 4.15/100,000/year and the point prevalence per 100,000 persons of 7. We found that the incidence and prevalence of MDS was higher in men than women and increased sharply with increasing age."
21070198,"BACKGROUND: Primary cutaneous amyloidosis (PCA) is a pruritic skin disorder most commonly seen in Southeast Asia and South America. Association of PCA with atopic dermatitis (AD) has been reported in the literature. However, no large-scale epidemiological study of PCA and its associations with other diseases has been conducted so far. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to provide overall demographic data and comorbidities of patients with PCA based on a nationwide database in Taiwan. METHODS: Cases of PCA were collected from records of National Health Insurance claims from 2000 to 2007. We analysed patients' gender, age when the diagnosis was first made, and the overall 8-year prevalence. We also investigated comorbidities. RESULTS: The overall 8-year prevalence of PCA was 7·87 per 10,000 persons. Although there was no significant gender difference in the prevalence of PCA, men and women showed a different peak age (men, 71-80 years; women, 41-50 years) and a different age distribution at diagnosis. The mean age at diagnosis of PCA was significantly younger for women than for men. Men sought medical assistance for PCA more frequently than women. There was a higher disease activity from May to September than during other months. PCA was strongly associated with AD (odds ratio 7·18). Patients with PCA had a higher comorbidity of hyperlipidaemia and diabetes mellitus. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first nationwide population-based epidemiological study of PCA. We demonstrate that PCA can be associated with other disorders, especially AD."
18815046,"The prevalence of sporadic inclusion body myositis (sIBM) is variable in different populations and ethnic groups. A previous survey in Western Australia in 2000 found a prevalence of 9.3 per million population. We have now performed a follow-up survey to determine whether there has since been any change in prevalence. The current prevalence was found to be 14.9 per million population, with a prevalence of 51.3 per million population in people over 50 years of age. This is the highest reported prevalence of sIBM and correlates with a high frequency of HLA-DR3 and the 8.1 major histocompatibility complex ancestral haplotype in this population. Review of a combined cohort of 57 sIBM cases from three Australian centres revealed a high rate of initial misdiagnosis and a mean time to diagnosis of 5.2 years, which suggests that even the latest prevalence figure may be an underestimate, and emphasising the need to increase the level of awareness of the condition among the medical community."
18565894,"PURPOSE Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are considered rare tumors and can produce a variety of hormones. In this study, we examined the epidemiology of and prognostic factors for NETs, because a thorough examination of neither had previously been performed. METHODS The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program registries were searched to identify NET cases from 1973 to 2004. Associated population data were used for incidence and prevalence analyses. Results We identified 35,618 patients with NETs. We observed a significant increase in the reported annual age-adjusted incidence of NETs from 1973 (1.09/100,000) to 2004 (5.25/100,000). Using the SEER 9 registry data, we estimated the 29-year limited-duration prevalence of NETs on January 1, 2004, to be 9,263. Also, the estimated 29-year limited-duration prevalence in the United States on that date was 103,312 cases (35/100,000). The most common primary tumor site varied by race, with the lung being the most common in white patients, and the rectum being the most common in Asian/Pacific Islander, American Indian/Alaskan Native, and African American patients. Additionally, survival duration varied by histologic grade. In multivariate analysis of patients with well-differentiated to moderately differentiated NETs, disease stage, primary tumor site, histologic grade, sex, race, age, and year of diagnosis were predictors of outcome (P < .001). CONCLUSION We observed increased reported incidence of NETs and increased survival durations over time, suggesting that NETs are more prevalent than previously reported. Clinicians need to be become familiar with the natural history and patterns of disease progression, which are characteristic of these tumors."
24140396,"Cholangiocarcinomas (CCAs) are hepatobiliary cancers with features of cholangiocyte differentiation; they can be classified anatomically as intrahepatic CCA (iCCA), perihilar CCA (pCCA), or distal CCA. These subtypes differ not only in their anatomic location, but in epidemiology, origin, etiology, pathogenesis, and treatment. The incidence and mortality of iCCA has been increasing over the past 3 decades, and only a low percentage of patients survive until 5 years after diagnosis. Geographic variations in the incidence of CCA are related to variations in risk factors. Changes in oncogene and inflammatory signaling pathways, as well as genetic and epigenetic alterations and chromosome aberrations, have been shown to contribute to the development of CCA. Furthermore, CCAs are surrounded by a dense stroma that contains many cancer-associated fibroblasts, which promotes their progression. We have gained a better understanding of the imaging characteristics of iCCAs and have developed advanced cytologic techniques to detect pCCAs. Patients with iCCAs usually are treated surgically, whereas liver transplantation after neoadjuvant chemoradiation is an option for a subset of patients with pCCAs. We review recent developments in our understanding of the epidemiology and pathogenesis of CCA, along with advances in classification, diagnosis, and treatment."
11436538,"In Korea, sarcoidosis is a very rare disease but the first nationwide survey performed in 1992 by the Korean Academy of Tuberculosis and Respiratory Diseases revealed 113 biopsy-proven cases. To investigate whether sarcoidosis is continuously increasing in Korea and verify the clinical pattern, the second nationwide survey was performed.The questionnaires were sent to hospitals of larger than 80-bed size for collection of biopsy-proven sarcoidosis patients newly diagnosed between July 1992 and June 1999.A total of 309 biopsy-proven cases was recruited from 58 hospitals. The incidence has gradually increased from 14 cases in 1993 (0.027/100,000) to 59 cases in 1998 (0.125/100,000). The peak age was in the thirties (33%) and females were predominant (64.6%). Not a single case was detected among 190,029 mass chest X-ray films taken in the national tuberculosis surveys from 1980 to 1995. The most common symptom was respiratory (42%) and the most frequently involved organ was the lung (87%), followed by skin (31%). Tuberculin skin anergy was found in 82.2%. Hypercalcemia was found in 9.7% and hypercalciuria in 22.5%. FVC and FEV1 were reduced in about a quarter of the patients and reduced DLCO was found in 37%.Sarcoidosis is still very rare in Korea even though it is increasing slowly and clinical manifestation was similar to the western pattern."
18329345,"Laboratory diagnosis for DNA repair diseases has been performed in western Europe from the early seventies for xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) and from the mid-eighties for Cockayne syndrome (CS) and trichothiodystrophy (TTD). The combined data from the DNA repair diagnostic centres in France, (West) Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom have been investigated for three groups of diseases: XP (including XP-variant), CS (including XP/CS complex) and TTD. Incidences in western Europe were for the first time established at 2.3 per million livebirths for XP, 2.7 per million for CS and 1.2 per million for TTD. As immigrant populations were disproportionately represented in the patients' groups, incidences were also established for the autochthonic western European population at: 0.9 per million for XP, 1.8 per million for CS and 1.1 per million for TTD. Perhaps contrary to general conceptions, compared to XP the incidence of CS appears to be somewhat higher and the incidence of TTD to be quite similar in the native West-European population."
16916626,"BACKGROUND: In 1992 France set up a national cystic fibrosis observatory (Observatoire national de la mucoviscidose, ONM) to monitor the state of health of patients on an annual basis. Using the ONM data, this study estimates the main indicators for life expectancy and assesses the total number of cystic fibrosis patients. METHODS: The data for the years 1994 to 2003 are divided into 3-year periods. Life tables are drawn up for these periods, from which mean and median lengths of life are determined. Using the most recent life table, the number of births in 2003 and the incidence of the disease, the total population of patients can be estimated, assuming a stationary population. RESULTS: In 2001-2003, life expectancy at birth of patients registered with the ONM was 39.1 years and median length of life was 36.4 years. These results, substantially better than those of 1994-1996, are linked to improved conditions of patient inclusion in the ONM database, to improvements in their healthcare, but also to the limitations of the life tables. Based on the 2003 data, the total theoretical number of patients is 6490, and coverage by the ONM database is thus 63.2%. CONCLUSIONS: These provisional results demonstrate the need to convert the ONM observatory into a registry providing exhaustive coverage of all patients."
20523074,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study is to investigate the epidemiology and medical expenses of myasthenia gravis (MG) in Taiwan. METHODS: Cases of MG were identified from the National Health Insurance Research Database with corresponding codes of the International Classification of Diseases, ninth revision (ICD-9), from January 2000 to December 2007. Age- and sex-specific incidences were estimated by dividing the incidence number by population data obtained from the Department of Statistics, Ministry of the Interior. RESULTS: During the study period, 5,211 cases were identified. The incidence ratio of males to females was 0.68. The average annual incidence rate was 2.1/100,000. MG occurred in all age groups with a higher incidence in older individuals and the lowest incidence in the 10- to 14-year-olds for both sexes. Among the 5,211 cases, 615 (12%) had a neoplasm of the thymus. The prevalence increased steadily during the study period from 8.4/100,000 in 2000 to 14.0/ 100,000 in 2007. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first population-based epidemiological study of MG in Taiwan. The incidence rate and prevalence were higher than in most published studies, especially in old age groups."
14517508,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the type and incidence of hyperthyroxinemic disorders detected by follow-up of infants with elevated screening total T4 (TT4) values. STUDY DESIGN: Infants born in Oregon with a screening TT4 measurement >3 SD above the mean were offered enrollment. Serum TT4, free T4, total T3, free T3, and thyroid-stimulating hormone concentrations were measured in study infants and their mothers. RESULTS: Over a 20-month period, 101 infants (51 boys) and their mothers enrolled in the study (of 241 eligible infants), from a total screening population of 80,884; 17 infants were identified with persistent hyperthyroxinemia (TT4 >16 microg/dL). Ten had thyroxine-binding globulin excess (1:8088), 5 had evidence for increased T4 binding but not thyroxine-binding globulin excess (1:16,177), and 2 had findings compatible with thyroid hormone resistance (1:40,442); the other 84 infants had transient hyperthyroxinemia. Sequence analysis revealed a point mutation in the thyroid hormone receptor-beta gene in one infant with thyroid hormone resistance; no mutation was identified in the other infant. CONCLUSIONS: Although neonatal Graves' disease occurs in approximately 1 in 25,000 newborn infants, we did not detect any case among 80,884 infants, most likely because their mothers were receiving antithyroid drugs. Although the other hyperthyroxinemic disorders in the aggregate occur frequently (1:4758) and may benefit from detection, in general they do not require treatment."
25375987,"CONTEXT: Craniopharyngiomas (CPs) in adults have been associated with excess mortality. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to investigate mortality and morbidity in patients with childhood-onset and adult-onset CP. METHODS: PATIENTS with CP were identified and followed in Swedish national health registries, 1987 through 2011. The inclusion criteria for the CP diagnosis were internally validated against patient records in 28% of the study population. SETTINGS: This was a nationwide population-based study. PATIENTS: A total of 307 patients (151 men and 156 women) were identified and included (mean follow-up, 9 years; range, 0-25 years). The inclusion criteria had a positive predictive value of 97% and a sensitivity of 92%. INTERVENTION: There were no interventions. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) and standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) with 95% confidence intervals were calculated using the Swedish population as the reference. RESULTS: During the study, 54 patients died compared with the expected number of 14.1, resulting in an SMR of 3.2 (2.2-4.7) for men and 4.9 (3.2-7.2) for women. PATIENTS with childhood-onset (n = 106) and adult-onset (n = 201) CP had SMRs of 17 (6.3-37) and 3.5 (2.6-4.6), respectively. PATIENTS with hypopituitarism (n = 250), diabetes insipidus (n = 110), and neither of these (n = 54) had SMRs of 4.3 (3.1-5.8), 6.1 (3.5-9.7), and 2.7 (1.4-4.6), respectively. The SMR due to cerebrovascular diseases was 5.1 (1.7-12). SIRs were 5.6 (3.8-8.0) for type 2 diabetes mellitus, 7.1 (5.0-9.9) for cerebral infarction, 0.7 (0.2-1.7) for myocardial infarction, 2.1 (1.4-3.0) for fracture, and 5.9 (3.4-9.4) for severe infection. The SIR for all malignant tumors was 1.3 (0.8-2.1). CONCLUSIONS: This first nationwide population-based study of patients with CP demonstrated excess mortality that was especially marked in patients with childhood-onset disease and among women. Death due to cerebrovascular diseases was increased 5-fold. Hypopituitarism and diabetes insipidus were negative prognostic factors for mortality and morbidity. PATIENTS with CP had increased disease burden related to type 2 diabetes mellitus, cerebral infarction, fracture, and severe infection."
458831,"An attempt was made to ascertain all the dwarfs in the State of Victoria. The incidence of achondroplasia proved to be approximately 1 in 26,000 live births in the period 1969 to 1975 when ascertainment was nearly complete. This indicates a mutation rate of 1.93 X 10(-5) per generation in this locus. Paternal age was shown to influence mutation. Ascertainment in earlier years of the study was low despite the very great effort made to find all cases. Patients with hypochondroplasia were particularly difficult to find. However, 25 cases were found for study. Overlap between hypochondroplasia and achondroplasia was found in all features except the facial appearance (which was the basis of definition). Achondroplasia was more severe in all regards, but some individuals with hypochondroplasia were very short and some had extreme degrees of spinal canal stenosis. The classical measurements used to describe the skull changes in acondroplasia failed to distinguish this condition from hypochondroplasia. More efficient indices were devised, but visual assessment of the size of the facial region compared to that of the cranial valult proved more reliable than any index. The clinical distinction based upon facial appearance remains the arbitrary basis of definition."
21239759,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the incidence and mortality of treated primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) by sex and age group in Taiwan. METHODS: We used claims data of the Bureau of National Health Insurance (NHI) of Taiwan from 2005 to 2007 for analysis. According to the NHI, pSS is classified as one of the financially catastrophic illnesses and patients with pSS could be exempted from copayment of all medical costs. To obtain a catastrophic illness certificate (CIC) for pSS, patients are required to meet the criteria of the American-European Consensus Group for pSS, and are reviewed by a committee. Patients approved for receipt of a CIC for pSS for the first time were defined as incident cases of treated pSS. RESULTS: A total of 3352 incident cases occurred between 2005 and 2007. The estimated mean annual incidence was 6.0 per 100,000 inhabitants (95% CI 5.8-6.2) for both sexes, 11.0 (95% CI 10.6-11.4) for women and 1.1 (95% CI 1.0-1.2) for men, with a female/male ratio of 9.9 (95% CI 8.8-11.1). Incidence increased with age, peaking at age 55-64 years in women and 65-74 years in men. The mortality rate was 33.4 per 1000 case person-years for men and 11.4 for women, with a male/female rate ratio of 2.9 (95% CI 1.7-5.3). CONCLUSION: The incidence of treated pSS in women is 10 times that in men. Nevertheless, pSS mortality in men is 3 times that in women."
25893613,"Acromegaly is a rare disease with complications and increased mortality. The incidence and prevalence of acromegaly worldwide is not well known.To gather information on patients diagnosed with acromegly in Iceland over 59 years.Information was retrospectively gathered about patients diagnosed with acromegaly from 1955 through 2013. Incidence was calculated from the total Icelandic population.Information was gathered from medical records at Landspitali National University Hospital, Iceland, housing the only endocrine department in the country, at the largest hospital outside of Reykjavik (Sjúkrahúsið á Akureyri, Akureyri Hospital) and the largest private outpatient clinic in Reykjavik, where some of the patients received follow-up care. Further, information on patients were sought from all endocrinologists treating adult patients in Iceland. All patients diagnosed with acromegaly during the study period were included.Fifty-two patients (32 men) were diagnosed during the study period. The average age at diagnosis was 44.5 years. Nine patients had died. Symptoms had been present for more than 3 years in most cases. Twenty-five patients had hypertension (48 %). Follow up information was available for 48 patients, 63 % were considered cured after treatment.The incidence of acromegaly in Iceland during the study period was much higher than earlier reports have indicated. During the last 9 years of the study 7.7 patients were diagnosed per million per year. At diagnosis, 38 % had developed hypertension and 10 % were diagnosed during follow up. This indicates the importance of endocrine disorders in the aetiology of hypertension."
20815889,"BACKGROUND: Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is an autoimmune liver disease characterized by the presence of anti-mitocondrial autoantibodies (AMA) which has an essential role also for diagnosis. In addition, also some anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) have been shown to be highly specific PBC. The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of PBC among the adults referring hospital for annual health check-up in Southern China by screening sera for PBC-specific autoantibodies. METHODS: AMA and ANA were screened in 8,126 adults (mean age 44 ± 15 years, 48% females) by indirect immunofluorenscence (IIF). Positive sera were tested by ELISA/immunoblotting for AMA-M2, anti-sp100 and anti-gp210. A diagnosis of PBC was re-assessed six months after the initial testing. RESULTS: Out of 8,126 individuals 35 were positive for AMA and 79 positive for ANA. Nineteen, 4, and 3 of the subjects positive for AMA and/or ANA showed reactivity for AMA-M2, anti-sp100 or gp210, respectively, further tested with ELISA/immunoblotting. Fourteen in the 39 individuals positive for AMA at IIF, AMA-M2, anti-gp210, or anti-sp100 had abnormal cholestatic liver functional indices. One definite and 3 probable PBC diagnosis could be made in 4 cases including 3 females and 1 male after half a year. CONCLUSIONS: We found a point prevalence rate of PBC among Southern Chinese adults attending for yearly health check-up of 492 cases per million (95% CI, 128 to 1,093) and 1,558 cases per million (95% CI, 294 to 3,815) for women over 40, a finding similar to prevalence reported in other geographical areas."
8018043,"OBJECTIVE:To calculate average annual incidence rates for Huntington's disease (HD) from 1950 through 1989 and to estimate prevalence rates of the disease for January 1, 1960, and January 1, 1990. DESIGN:Health care records from all sources, including hospitals, outpatient clinics, and long-term care institutions, are readily available for all inhabitants of Olmsted County, Minnesota. The diagnoses entered in these records have been coded and indexed. All health care records containing a diagnosis that might suggest HD were reviewed, and those patients for whom the symptoms of HD began between January 1, 1950, and December 31, 1989, were identified. We used specific criteria for diagnosing HD. PARTICIPANTS:Health care records were reviewed; residence in Olmsted County during the year of symptom onset was required. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:Average annual incidence rates and prevalence rates for January 1, 1960, and January 1, 1990. RESULTS:Overall incidence rates were 0.4 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.1 to 0.8) for women and 0.2 (95% CI, 0.04 to 0.6) for men per 100,000 person-years. Estimated prevalence rates for January 1, 1960, per 100,000 person-years were 6 (95% CI, 0.7 to 21.5) for women and 6.6 (95% CI, 0.8 to 23.8) for men. For January 1, 1990, the prevalence rates were 1.8 (95% CI, 0.04 to 10.2) for women and 2 (95% CI, 0.05 to 10.9) for men. CONCLUSIONS:Incidence and prevalence rates of HD in this community are similar to those reported in other communities. The small numbers of affected persons do not allow an estimate of variation over time."
8894197,"BACKGROUND:Hypnagogic and hypnopompic hallucinations are common in narcolepsy. However, the prevalence of these phenomena in the general population is uncertain. METHOD:A representative community sample of 4972 people in the UK, aged 15-100, was interviewed by telephone (79.6% of those contacted). Interviews were performed by lay interviewers using a computerised system that guided the interviewer through the interview process. RESULTS:Thirty-seven per cent of the sample reported experiencing hypnagogic hallucinations and 12.5% reported hypnopompic hallucinations. Both types of hallucinations were significantly more common among subjects with symptoms of insomnia, excessive daytime sleepiness or mental disorders. According to this study, the prevalence of narcolepsy in the UK is 0.04%. CONCLUSIONS:Hypnagogic and hypnopompic hallucinations were much more common than expected, with a prevalence that far exceeds that which can be explained by the association with narcolepsy. Hypnopompic hallucinations may be a better indicator of narcolepsy than hypnagogic hallucinations in subjects reporting excessive daytime sleepiness."
31302675,"Epilepsy is common in early childhood. In this age group it is associated with high rates of therapy-resistance, and with cognitive, motor, and behavioural comorbidity. A large number of genes, with wide ranging functions, are implicated in its aetiology, especially in those with therapy-resistant seizures. Identifying the more common single-gene epilepsies will aid in targeting resources, the prioritization of diagnostic testing and development of precision therapy. Previous studies of genetic testing in epilepsy have not been prospective and population-based. Therefore, the population-incidence of common genetic epilepsies remains unknown. The objective of this study was to describe the incidence and phenotypic spectrum of the most common single-gene epilepsies in young children, and to calculate what proportion are amenable to precision therapy. This was a prospective national epidemiological cohort study. All children presenting with epilepsy before 36 months of age were eligible. Children presenting with recurrent prolonged (>10 min) febrile seizures; febrile or afebrile status epilepticus (>30 min); or with clusters of two or more febrile or afebrile seizures within a 24-h period were also eligible. Participants were recruited from all 20 regional paediatric departments and four tertiary children's hospitals in Scotland over a 3-year period. DNA samples were tested on a custom-designed 104-gene epilepsy panel. Detailed clinical information was systematically gathered at initial presentation and during follow-up. Clinical and genetic data were reviewed by a multidisciplinary team of clinicians and genetic scientists. The pathogenic significance of the genetic variants was assessed in accordance with the guidelines of UK Association of Clinical Genetic Science (ACGS). Of the 343 patients who met inclusion criteria, 333 completed genetic testing, and 80/333 (24%) had a diagnostic genetic finding. The overall estimated annual incidence of single-gene epilepsies in this well-defined population was 1 per 2120 live births (47.2/100 000; 95% confidence interval 36.9-57.5). PRRT2 was the most common single-gene epilepsy with an incidence of 1 per 9970 live births (10.0/100 000; 95% confidence interval 5.26-14.8) followed by SCN1A: 1 per 12 200 (8.26/100 000; 95% confidence interval 3.93-12.6); KCNQ2: 1 per 17 000 (5.89/100 000; 95% confidence interval 2.24-9.56) and SLC2A1: 1 per 24 300 (4.13/100 000; 95% confidence interval 1.07-7.19). Presentation before the age of 6 months, and presentation with afebrile focal seizures were significantly associated with genetic diagnosis. Single-gene disorders accounted for a quarter of the seizure disorders in this cohort. Genetic testing is recommended to identify children who may benefit from precision treatment and should be mainstream practice in early childhood onset epilepsy."
23033178,"In this study, the frequency of detected congenital hypothyroidism, phenylketonuria and haemoglobinopathies in the State of Rio de Janeiro's (Brazil) Newborn Screening Program (NBSP) was analyzed between the years of 2005 and 2007. There were two Newborn Screening Reference Centers (named NSRC A and B) with programmatic differences. In 2007, overall detection coverage reached 80.7%. The increase in the incidence of congenital hypothyroidism (1:1,030 in 2007) was attributed to the reduction of neonatal TSH value limits over time. The incidence discrepancy of phenylketonuria between NSRC A (1:28,427) and B (1:16,522) might be partially explained by the small number of cases. The incidence of sickle cell disease and its traits were uniformly high (1:1,288 and 1:21, respectively). This was coherent with the ethnic composition of the population. The differences in laboratory methods and critical values, in addition to other programmatic issues, may explain the variances in the results and limited analysis of the role of biological and environmental determinants in the occurrence of these diseases."
22534148,"Invasive group A Streptococcus (GAS) infections are associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Recent national surveillance data report stable rates of invasive GAS disease, although these may not capture geographic variation.We performed a population-based, retrospective laboratory surveillance study of invasive GAS disease among Utah residents from 2002-2010. We used Intermountain Healthcare's electronic medical records and data warehouse to identify patients from whom GAS was isolated by culture. We defined clinical syndromes of invasive GAS disease on the basis of International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes. We abstracted demographic information, comorbidities, and microbiologic and laboratory findings.From 2002-2010, we identified 1514 cases of invasive GAS disease among Utah residents. The estimated mean annual incidence rate was 6.3 cases/100,000 persons, which was higher than the national rate of 3.6 cases/100,000 (P < .01). The incidence of invasive GAS disease in Utah rose from 3.5 cases/100,000 persons in 2002 to 9.8 cases/100,000 persons in 2010 (P = .01). Among children aged <18 years, the incidence of invasive GAS increased from 3.0 cases/100,000 children in 2002 to 14.1 cases/100,000 children in 2010 (P < .01). The increase in the pediatric population was due, in part, to an increase in GAS pneumonia (P = .047). The rate of invasive GAS disease in adults aged 18-64 years increased from 3.4 cases/100 000 persons in 2002 to 7.6 cases/100,000 persons in 2010 (P = .02). Rates among those aged ≥65 years were stable. The incidence of acute rheumatic fever declined from 6.1 to 3.7 cases/100,000 (P = .04).The epidemiologic characteristics of invasive GAS disease in Utah has changed substantially over the past decade, including a significant increase in the overall incidence of invasive disease-driven primarily by increasing disease in younger persons-that coincided temporally with a decrease in the incidence of acute rheumatic fever."
2321478,"A retrospective study of all Swedish patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) born 1969-1986, was conducted to elucidate possible benefits of neonatal screening for CAH. Information was obtained about 150 patients (67 male, 83 female). One hundred and forty-three cases were regarded as classical and seven as non-classical (symptoms after 5 years of age or cryptic). All but two (one girl with 11-hydroxylase deficiency and one boy with beta-hydroxysteroid-dehydrogenase deficiency) had 21-hydroxylase deficiency. The prevalence was 1:11,500. Ninety-three patients (48 male, 45 female) displayed salt loss, all before the age of 3 months. Two boys had died and many children had been critically ill during the first weeks of life. The median age at diagnosis for boys in this group was 21 days. Gender assignment was a major problem in 38 of 57 girls with ambiguous genitalia noticed during the first day. Fifteen of these girls were considered to be male for their first 40 days (median), before the CAH diagnosis was established. Patients in whom the first symptom was manifested after the age of one year often showed growth acceleration, which frequently was overlooked. Median diagnostic delay in this group was 17 months. Possible benefits of neonatal screening are: avoidance of a serious salt-loss crisis; earlier diagnosis and correct gender assignment in virilized girls; decreased virilization, growth acceleration and premature pubarche in prepubertal children; and reduced negative consequences for psycho-social development and final height."
18048855,"The objectives of the present study were to estimate an annual number of patients with moyamoya disease in Japan and to describe the clinicoepidemiological features of the disease.The study consisted of 2 questionnaire surveys, which were distributed to randomly selected departments of neurosurgery, internal medicine, neurology, cerebrovascular medicine, and pediatrics in hospitals throughout Japan. The first survey inquired about the number of the patients treated in 2003, and the second requested additional detailed clinicoepidemiological information about each patient identified in the first survey.In 2003, the total number of patients treated in Japan was estimated at 7700 (95% confidence interval, 6300 to 9300). Sex ratio (women to men) of the patients was 1.8. For men, the peak of moyamoya disease was observed in patients aged 10 to 14 years and for women aged 20 to 24 years. Annual rate of newly diagnosed cases in 2003 was 0.54 per 100,000 population. Family history of moyamoya disease was found in 12.1% of the patients. The majority (77.9%) were treated as outpatients.Although the clinicoepidemiological features of the patients in the present study were almost similar to those obtained in previous ones, the estimated prevalence of moyamoya disease in Japan has almost doubled during the recent decade (3900 in 1994 and 7700 in 2003). The increase could partly be explained by the increase in newly diagnosed cases (0.35 in 1994 and 0.54 in 2003 per 100,000 population)."
21513910,"Thyroid cancer (TC) incidence, in France and over the world, has dramatically increased over the last two decades. The temporal and geographical incidence trends in France and in the world are analysed. The increased incidence of TC is actual, mainly due to an increase of papillary microcarcinomas. The spread of ultrasonographic and cytological procedures, the extensiveness of thyroidectomies lead to diagnostic advance, to a better preoperative selection of patients and to the discovery of occult microcarcinomas. Nevertheless, the impact of the risk factors of thyroid cancer on the increase of incidence is not excluded. These risk factors are analysed, especially environmental chemicals agents that disrupt thyroid function."
21351115,"UNLABELLED: Incidence studies of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) are important for describing the disease's burden and for shedding light on the disease's etiology. The purposes of this study were to conduct a systematic review of the incidence studies of PSC with a meta-analysis and to investigate possible geographic variations and temporal trends in the incidence of the disease. A systematic literature search of MEDLINE (1950-2010) and Embase (1980-2010) was conducted to identify studies investigating the incidence of PSC. The incidence of PSC was summarized with an incidence rate (IR) and 95% confidence intervals. The test of heterogeneity was performed with the Q statistic. Secondary variables extracted from the articles included the following: the method of case ascertainment, the country, the time period, the age, the male/female incidence rate ratio (IRR), and the incidence of PSC subtypes (small-duct or large-duct PSC and inflammatory bowel disease). Stratified and sensitivity analyses were performed to explore heterogeneity between studies and to assess effects of study quality. Time trends were used to explore differences in the incidence across time. The search retrieved 1669 potentially eligible citations; 8 studies met the inclusion criteria. According to a random-effects model, the pooled IR was 0.77 (0.45-1.09) per 100,000 person-years. However, significant heterogeneity was observed between studies (P < 0.001). Sensitivity analyses excluding non-population-based studies increased the overall IR to 1.00 (0.82-1.17) and eliminated the heterogeneity between studies (P = 0.08). The IRR for males versus females was 1.70 (1.34-2.07), and the median age was 41 years (35-47 years). All studies investigating time trends reported an overall increase in the incidence of PSC. CONCLUSION: The incidence of PSC is similar in North American and European countries and continues to increase over time. Incidence data from developing countries are lacking, and this limits our understanding of the global incidence of PSC."
21695197,"BACKGROUND: Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) is a severe neurometabolic disease caused mainly by deficiency of arylsulfatase A encoded by the ARSA gene. Based on epidemiological surveys the incidence of MLD per 100,000 live births varied from 0.6 to 2.5. Our purpose was to estimate the birth prevalence of MLD in Poland by determining population frequency of the common pathogenic ARSA gene mutations and to compare this estimate with epidemiological data. METHODOLOGY: We studied two independently ascertained cohorts from the Polish background population (N∼3000 each) and determined carrier rates of common ARSA gene mutations: c.459+1G>A, p.P426L, p.I179S (cohort 1) and c.459+1G>A, p.I179S (cohort 2). PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Taking into account ARSA gene mutation distribution among 60 Polish patients, the expected MLD birth prevalence in the general population (assuming no selection against homozygous fetuses) was estimated as 4.0/100,000 and 4.1/100,000, respectively for the 1(st) and the 2(nd) cohort with a pooled estimate of 4.1/100,000 (CI: 1.8-9.4) which was higher than the estimate of 0.38 per 100,000 live births based on diagnosed cases. The p.I179S mutation was relatively more prevalent among controls than patients (OR = 3.6, P = 0.0082, for a comparison of p.I179S frequency relative to c.459+1G>A between controls vs. patients). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The observed discrepancy between the measured incidence of metachromatic leukodystrophy and the predicted carriage rates suggests that MLD is substantially underdiagnosed in the Polish population. The underdiagnosis rate may be particularly high among patients with p.I179S mutation whose disease is characterized mainly by psychotic symptoms."
21732012,"Severe combined immunodeficiencies (SCID) are a heterogeneous group of genetic disorders characterized by a blockade or impairment of both cellular and humoral immunity. Several epidemiological studies in different geographic areas have shown that the most common type of SCID affecting almost half of these patients is the X-linked common γ-chain (γ(c)) deficiency. The objective of the study was to document the incidence and types of SCID in our area. We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients who were diagnosed with SCID in the major immunology center in Greece for a 20-year period. During the study period, 30 children from 27 unrelated families with final diagnosis of SCID were identified. The incidence of SCID in Greece is estimated at 1.7 cases per 100,000 live births. Out of 30 children, 19 were boys (63.3%) and 26 (86.7%) had Greek maternal origin. Lymphocyte immunophenotypes that were identified were T(-)B(-)NK(+) in 12 (40%) children, T(-)B(+)NK(-) in six (20%), T(-)B(+)NK(+) in three (10%), T(-)B(-)NK(-) in two (6.7%) and T(+)B(+/-)NK(+) in seven (23.4%) (among them, four [13.4%] females with Omenn's syndrome). Molecular diagnosis was available for 12 children: γ(c) (2) with non Greek maternal origin, Jak3 (2), Rag1 (2), Artemis (3), ADA deficiency (2), PNP deficiency (1). Out of the 26 children of Greek maternal origin diagnosed with SCID representing 23 distinct families, only two (8.7%) had lymphocyte immunophenotype compatible with γ(c)-chain gene mutation (no molecular testing or enough DNA was available for them at the time of diagnosis). Findings of the present study suggest that, for unknown reasons, mutations of the γ(c) chain of several cytokine receptors have a rare occurrence in our area."
17588141,"Despite rapid developments in the science of primary immunodeficiency diseases (PID), population characteristics and the burden of disease are poorly characterized. Aggregated data on PID via patient registries are a key component of the public health response. The web-enabled Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy PID Register was designed and implemented to address gaps in knowledge of PID.The register provided a cumulative, cross-sectional survey of PID patients in Australia and New Zealand via an online, single time point, center-based, voluntarily recalled, and patient-consented questionnaire.Eighty-eight centers reported 1,209 patients across 56 separate PID syndromes. The study prevalence (cases per 100,000 population) was 5.6 for Australia, 12.4 for the state of South Australia, and 4.9 for Australia and New Zealand combined. Predominately antibody deficiency syndromes accounted for 77% of patients. Common variable immunodeficiency was the most common diagnosis. Patients were geographically dispersed with 80% of centers reporting caseloads of less than 20 patients. Potentially preventable complications of disease were common. Immunoglobulin replacement therapy was used in 30 conditions with 26.5% of the total recipients having antibody deficiency disorders with normal serum IgG.PID in Australia and New Zealand are prevalent, clinically diverse, geographically dispersed, and are characterized by high rates of potentially preventable morbidity and resource utilization. A public health focus on PID is required, including strategies to correct disparities in access to care, improve molecular diagnostics and reduce preventable complications of disease. Further studies in antibody deficiency syndromes with normal serum IgG are required."
16263368,"Birdshot chorioretinopathy is a well-known, yet poorly understood, form of posterior uveitis, characterized by multiple, distinctive, hypopigmented choroidal lesions, and strongly associated with human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A29. We reviewed all English language publications regarding birdshot chorioretinopathy and performed analyses of combined patient data taken from these articles. The mean age at presentation was 53 years, with a slight female predominance (54.1%). At least 95.7% of reported patients have been HLA-A29-positive. Blurring of vision and floaters are the most prevalent presenting complaints, even in patients with visual acuity of 20/20 or better in both eyes. Birdshot chorioretinopathy is a slowly progressive disease with profound dysfunction of vision that may not be reflected in Snellen visual acuity. Two or more lines of Snellen visual acuity were lost in approximately 20% of eyes over a median follow-up of 3.5 years; macular edema was the most common cause of reduced visual acuity. Overall, patients had a slow decline in visual acuity, despite the fact that nearly all were treated with anti-inflammatory therapies. Final visual acuity in the better eye was 20/40 or better in 75.1% of patients and 20/200 or worse in 9.8% of patients. Oral corticosteroids and cyclosporine were the most commonly used medications. Using a regression model, patients in the literature that have been treated with cyclosporine alone had better final visual acuity than patients treated with oral corticosteroids alone. Further study is needed to determine the optimal methods for treating and monitoring patients with birdshot chorioretinopathy."

However, HFI is not the only genetic ill to have emerged from our obsession with sugar: the slave trade, which had such a key part in the development of the sugar industry, also included major genetic consequences in its haunting legacy."
20039171,"Churg-Strauss Syndrome (SCS) is a systemic vasculitis associated with asthma and eosinophilia. The aim of our work is to describe this pathology in the Burgundian population in France. We counted from the hospitalisation data-processing summaries, the whole of the SCS hospitalised in Burgundy between 1998 and 2008. During the follow-up, the clinical and paraclinical characteristics of every patient were collected. The average prevalence is of 11.3 per million inhabitants and the incidence is of 1.2 new cases per million inhabitants per annum. There exists however, a great prevalence disparity and incidence amongst the various departments of the area. The patient's average follow-up is of 7.7 years. In 23% of the cases one finds a starting factor for vasculitis. The delay between the first signs and the diagnostic is an average of 61 months. The ANCA are positive in 26% of cases and of anti-myeloperoxidase specificity in 83% of cases (P < 0.001). The most profitable biopsies are essentially cutaneous and neuromuscular. At the diagnostic, two-third of the patients have had a treatment adapted according to the current recommendations based on the Five Factor Score. The remission rate within a 1-year period is of 77%. The remission is strongly correlated to the therapeutic protocol associating corticoids and cyclophosphamide (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the prevalence of SCS in our area is similar to that observed in other European regions. However, this vasculitis remains a difficult and often a tardive diagnostic pathology."
17494979,"The clinical and epidemiological characteristics of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) in an Italian population were assessed.All subjects with a diagnosis of demyelinating neuropathy after 1990 in Piemonte and Valle d'Aosta (4,334,225 inhabitants) were considered. The diagnosis of CIDP was based on the research criteria of the American Academy of Neurology. 165 of 294 patients met the diagnostic criteria.The crude prevalence rate was 3.58/100,000 population (95% CI 3.02 to 4.20). At the prevalence day, 76 (49.0%) cases had definite, 67 (43.2%) probable and 12 (7.7%) possible CIDP; disability was mild in 105 (67.7%) cases, moderate in 32 (20.6%) and severe in 18 (11.6%). The course was remitting-relapsing in 40 cases (25.8%), chronic progressive in 96 (61.9%) and monophasic in 19 (12.3%). Considering the 95 patients whose disorder presented in the period 1995-2001, the mean annual crude incidence rate was 0.36/100,000 population (95% CI 0.29 to 0.44), with a male to female ratio of 2.3:1. 14 cases were affected by diabetes mellitus. In multivariate analysis, factors related to severe disability at the prevalence day were: age >60 years; failure of immunomodulating therapies at the time of diagnosis; worse disability at nadir; and chronic course.Incidence and prevalence rates of CIDP in Italy were higher than those observed in most previous studies. At the prevalence day, more than 80% of cases had a mild or moderate disability, indicating either a good response to immunomodulating therapy or a tendency of CIDP to have a mild course in most cases."
26792654,"Incidence and prevalence estimates of acromegaly in the United States (US) are limited. Most existing reports are based on European data sources. The objective of this study was to estimate the annual incidence and prevalence of acromegaly in a large US managed care population, overall and stratified by age, sex, and geographic region, using data from 2008 to 2012.Using administrative claims data, commercial health plan enrollees were identified with acromegaly if they had two or more medical claims with an acromegaly diagnosis code (ICD-9-CM: 253.0×) or one medical claim with an acromegaly diagnosis code in combination with one other claim for a pituitary tumor or pituitary procedure. The first date for an acromegaly-related claim set the index year. Incidence rates for each year were calculated by dividing the number of new acromegaly cases by the calculated person-time at risk. Annual prevalence estimates were calculated by dividing the number with any evidence of acromegaly by the total number of health plan enrollees enrolled for at least 1 day during each calendar year. Incidence and prevalence estimates were stratified by age (0-17, 18-44, 45-64, 65+ years), sex (male, female), and US geographic region of the health plan (Midwest, Northeast, South, West).Overall annual incidence rates of acromegaly were relatively constant across 2008-2012 with ~11 cases per million person-years (PMPY). Rates increased with age, ranging from 3-8 cases PMPY among children aged 0-17 years old to 9-18 cases PMPY among adults aged 65 and older. Females had 12 cases PMPY on average compared to 10 cases PMPY among men. On average, the Midwest had the lowest incidence rates (7 cases PMPY) compared to the Northeast, South and West (14, 12, and 10 cases PMPY, respectively). The overall annual prevalence of acromegaly was relatively constant across the 5 years from 2008 to 2012 with approximately 78 cases per million each year. Annual prevalence estimates increased with age, ranging from 29-37 cases per million among children aged 0-17 years old to 148-182 cases per million among adults aged 65 years and older. Males and females were similarly affected; each with approximately 77 cases per million each year. The Northeast and South had the highest prevalence estimates (92 and 89 cases per million, respectively); while the estimates for the West and Midwest were lower (65 and 57 cases per million, respectively) each year.This study examined 5 years of recent data to estimate the incidence and prevalence of acromegaly in a large geographically-diverse managed care population. The incidence rates were higher on average than published rates outside the US (11 vs. 3.3 PMPY), but prevalence estimates were consistent with previous reports. Incidence and prevalence both increased by age, did not differ for males and females, and varied slightly by US geographic region. The age and sex distribution of the selected population matched the known epidemiology of the disease. Using a claims-based approach, this analysis only captured acromegaly cases with an acromegaly-related medical claim. As a result, these estimates may underestimate the incidence and prevalence of acromegaly in US commercial health plans as they did not include individuals who were undiagnosed, in remission, undertreated, or not monitored during the study period. At the same time, these estimates may be viewed as an upper bound on the incidence of acromegaly in the US as the estimates did not include individuals who were in other health plans or uninsured during the study period. Additional evaluations are needed to identify the full extent of acromegaly in the US."
16467042,"BACKGROUND: Adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD) is considered a rare disease, but few data exist on the incidence and prevalence of AOSD. This study has analysed the epidemiology, disease presentation, and outcome of AOSD in a stable homogeneous population in Northern Norway. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of all AOSD patients registered in 1990-2000 at the only hospital in the region with a Rheumatology Service. Clinical diagnosis and exclusion of patients were directed by the Yamaguchi criteria for AOSD. Demographic and clinical data at baseline were extracted from patient records and supplemented with data gathered at control visits. Data were analysed with nonparametric methods. RESULTS: AOSD was ascertained in 13 patients; the estimated annual AOSD incidence was 0.4/100,000 adults (95% CI 0.11-0.97), while point prevalence of AOSD increased from 3.4/100,000 (95% CI 0.8-9.4) in 1990 to 6.9/100,000 in 2000 (95% CI 2.7-14.2). Mean diagnostic delay was 5.2 months (range 0.5-18). Serum ferritin > 5 times the normal upper level had 63% diagnostic sensitivity. During 69 months' follow-up, one patient died, 6/13 patients achieved sustained remission, while six patients developed a chronic progressive (n = 3) or a relapsing/remitting disease course (n = 3). Four of these six patents had to enter social security programmes. CONCLUSION: The annual incidence of AOSD in Northern Norway is at least 0.4/100,000 adults. AOSD in this region is more prevalent than in France or Japan, affects more males, and approximates to the prevalence of juvenile Still's disease. Half of all patients have a monocyclic disease course, while mortality and invalidity occur in patients with chronic disease."
22374000,"BACKGROUND: Much of the literature on the epidemiology of cleft lip with or without cleft palate is more than three decades old. The question arose as to whether there has been any recent change or trend in its rate of occurrence. METHODS: The number of live births with cleft lip or other congenital anomalies was solicited from national and international organizations. Data were collected for 34 states and 30 countries for the years 2002 to 2006. All data were normalized and reported per 10,000 live births. Descriptive statistics, in addition to correlation and regression, were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: Data for the 5-year period demonstrated that the overall congenital anomaly rate increased in the United States and decreased internationally. The states with the highest and lowest rates were Maryland (21.46) and West Virginia (2.59), respectively. The United States cleft lip national rate averaged 7.75. Countries with the highest and lowest rates were Japan (19.05) and South Africa (3.13), respectively. Internationally, the rate of cleft lip declined, with an average overall prevalence of 7.94. CONCLUSIONS: The average prevalence of cleft lip with or without cleft palate was 7.75 per 10,000 live births in the United States and 7.94 per 10,000 live births internationally. The trends diverged over the 5-year period, as the rate was stable in the United States and the international rate declined."
21978347,"OBJECTIVES:To describe the demographics, clinical features and outcomes among people with cystic fibrosis (CF) in Australia and to estimate incidence of the disease. DESIGN AND SETTING:Cross-sectional analysis using data from the Australian Cystic Fibrosis Data Registry for 2009. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:Numbers of diagnoses, pulmonary and anthropometric measurements, microbiological culture results, rates of hospitalisation and transplantation, and numbers of medical complications and deaths. RESULTS:In 2009, data were submitted on 2986 people (48% female). Median age was 17.6 years and 49% of people were aged 18 years or over. Seventy-eight people were newly diagnosed. Fourteen people died and 14 people underwent lung transplantation in the year. Lung function and nutrition were relatively normal among children but deteriorated (more rapidly) among adolescents. With increasing age, progressive respiratory disease was apparent, and the frequency of CF-related complications and use of health care resources increased. In all age groups, there was a wide range in severity of lung disease and nutritional status. CONCLUSIONS:CF remains a progressive respiratory disease and is associated with multisystem complications. The acceleration in disease severity in adolescence and early adulthood suggests that better treatment at these stages is required to further improve survival."
20130418,"BACKGROUND: A systematic review of literature published between 1980 and 2007, on the incidence of myasthenia gravis, was undertaken. METHODS: All relevant papers found through searches of Medline, Embase and Science Direct were critically appraised and an assessment was made of the reliability of the reported incidence data. RESULTS: Thirty-one studies were included in the review, the majority of which investigated populations in Europe. The incidence rates reported were between 3.0 and 30.0/1,000,000/year. However, it is thought that the rates at the upper end of this range, reported by the prospective studies, provided the most accurate estimates. Overall, incidence rates have increased over time owing to a greater awareness of the disease and improved methods of diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: The most accurate estimate of incidence of myasthenia gravis was around 30/ 1,000,000/year. The incidence in children and adolescents aged 0-19 years was found to be between 1.0 and 5.0/ 1,000,000/year. The rates presented in this review are likely to be an underestimate of the true incidence rates, as mild cases will have been missed and cases in the elderly will have been misdiagnosed."
19709101,"BACKGROUND: Hereditary angio-oedema (HAE) is a rare disease caused by deficiency of complement C1 inhibitor (C1 inhibitor). The diagnosis is challenging as the disease can have a variety of clinical manifestations. In 2001 a national HAE comprehensive care centre was established and a search for these patients was initiated. OBJECTIVES: To identify and characterize all patients with HAE in Denmark and increase awareness of the disease. METHODS: Patients were recruited from hospital departments, dermatologists in private practice, Centres for Rare Diseases, the Danish patient organization and the national reference laboratory. Family interviews were conducted and medical records were evaluated. Information was spread through lectures, articles in popular magazines and via television. National guidelines for diagnosis and treatment were published. RESULTS: Eighty-two patients were identified. The mean diagnostic delay was 16.3 years. Five patients had HAE type II. Forty-five patients reported a characteristic serpiginous rash (erythema marginatum). More than 90% of patients had noticed precipitating factors before skin and mucosal swellings. Four patients underwent a total of eight tracheotomies and five families recalled 11 relatives who died of HAE. CONCLUSIONS: The minimal prevalence of HAE in Denmark is approximately 1.41 per 100 000 inhabitants. The risk of upper airway obstruction underlines the importance of diagnosing these patients. Precipitating factors, a preceding or concomitant serpiginous erythema and cutaneous swelling and/or abdominal pain attack and/or laryngeal oedema are clues to the diagnosis. As a consequence of this survey, information has been spread to patients, families and physicians."
10646777,"BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: The incidence of gastroschisis has increased over the past 3 decades in a number of countries. To elucidate the Japanese status of anterior abdominal wall defects, the Japanese Society of Pediatric Surgeons conducted a national survey in Japan. METHODS: Information was obtained by sending out a questionnaire to 192 University Hospitals, Children's hospitals, and general hospitals that each had more than 200 beds. The characteristics of the patients including the birth date, birth weight, gestations, rate of associated anomalies, rate of antenatal diagnosis and prognosis, maternal age, gravidity, history of smoking, and drug use were analyzed. RESULTS: The authors obtained answers from 149 institutions, including 1,785 cases of omphalocele and 970 cases of gastroschisis, which were treated between 1975 to 1997. There was a significant increase in the incidence of gastroschisis, from 0.131 in 1975 to 1980, 0.269 in 1981 to 1985, 0.337 in 1986 to 1990, 0.461 in 1991 to 1995 to 0.467 per 10,000 births in 1996 to 1997. The incidence of omphalocele was 0.322 in 1975 to 1980, 0.567 in 1981 to 1985, 0.657 in 1986 to 1990, 0.741 in 1991 to 1995 to 0.626 per 10,000 births in 1996 to 1997, respectively. In the omphalocele group, 43.1% of the mothers were between 25 to 29 years of age, whereas in the gastroschisis group 42.6% of the mothers were 20 to 24 years of age. In the gastroschisis group, the number of primipara mothers was larger than that of multipara mothers. In the omphalocele group, approximately 10% of the mothers smoked during each period, whereas in the gastroschisis group, the percentage of smoking mothers increased chronologically from 12.9% in 1981 to 1985, 18.7% in 1986 to 1990, 23.5% in 1991 to 1995 and 29.3% in 1996 to 1997. A history of drug use by the mother was approximately 10% for both the omphalocele and gastroschisis groups. In the omphalocele group, 55.9% had associated anomalies against 21.8% in the gastroschisis group. Approximately 10% in the omphalocele group and less than 3% in the gastroschisis group showed chromosomal abnormalities. From 1986, a significant number of cases detected antenatally has been observed. CONCLUSIONS: There have been substantial changes in the incidence of anterior abdominal wall defects, particularly regarding gastroschisis in Japan. The reasons for such changes are most likely multifactorial, further epidemiological monitoring is thus called for."
11399707,"OBJECTIVES:To characterize the incidence of patients with primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH) in Israel and their outcomes. METHODS:We have evaluated retrospectively all the patients in Israel in whom PPH was diagnosed between the years 1988 and 1997. We looked at medical history, hemodynamic data, pulmonary function and gas exchange, and demographic variables. Patients were followed up for survival until November 1997. Life table analysis and Kaplan-Meier statistics were used to estimate the overall survival distribution. Regression analysis was used to examine the relations between survival and selected variables. RESULTS:Overall, we found 44 patients with PPH. The estimated incidence of PPH in Israel is 1.4 new cases per year per million population. The mean (+/- SD) age at diagnosis was 43 +/- 13 years. In the Jewish population, PPH was more frequent among immigrants from Europe and the United States. The mean interval from the onset of symptoms to diagnosis was 3 years (median, 2 years). The median survival time was 4 years. The 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year survival rates were 82%, 57%, and 43%, respectively. The major variables influencing the survival rate were the following: interval from symptom onset to diagnosis; and hemodynamic measurements (ie, mean pulmonary artery pressure, mean right atrial pressure, and cardiac index). In comparison to rates discerned from the National Institutes of Health registry data, the survival rate in Israel is somewhat better and prognosis is influenced by similar hemodynamic variables. CONCLUSION:PPH is a rare and fatal disease in Israel. New therapeutic modalities such as prostacyclin therapy and lung transplantation may improve survival among patients with this malignant disease."
12207586,"BACKGROUND:The subepidermal immunobullous disorders (SEIBDs) comprise bullous pemphigoid (BP), cicatricial pemphigoid (CP), epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (EBA), linear IgA disease (LAD), dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), pemphigoid gestationis (PG) and bullous systemic lupus erythematosus (BSLE). They are thought to be rarer in the Far East than in western Europe. OBJECTIVE:This 2-year retrospective study investigates the spectrum seen at our centre and the minimum estimated incidence of each. PATIENTS AND METHODS:A total of 67 patients seen at the National Skin Centre (NSC), Singapore between January 1998 and December 1999 were diagnosed as having an SEIBD. Fifty-nine (88%) had BP, four (6%) had EBA, two (3%) LAD and two (3%) BSLE. There were no cases of CP, DH or PG diagnosed during this period. The minimum estimated incidence in our local population was 7.6, 0.5, 0.26 and 0.26 per million population per year, respectively. The mean age of onset was 77, 68, 65 and 31 years, respectively. RESULTS:BP is the commonest SEIBD seen locally, with an incidence at least equal to that in western Europe. It is diagnosed at our centre three times more frequently than pemphigus. There is a predilection for ethnic Chinese but not Indian. EBA is twice as common as in western Europe and shows a predilection for ethnic Indians. LAD is rare here compared to China, despite the predominant Chinese population. BSLE is also rare. In contrast to western Europe, CP, DH and PG are very rare in Singapore. CONCLUSIONS:This is the first study from this region to show that certain SEIBDs are not rarer in the Far East, as previously thought."
26108864,"Neural tube defects (NTDs) are the most common of the severe malformations of the brain and spinal cord. Increased maternal intake of folic acid (FA) during the periconceptional period is known to reduce NTD risk. Data from 1046 NTD cases in South Carolina were gathered over 20 years of surveillance. It was possible to determine maternal periconceptional FA use in 615 NTD-affected pregnancies. In 163 occurrent (26.9%) and two recurrent (22%) NTD cases, the mothers reported periconceptional FA use. These women were older and more likely to be white. Maternal periconceptional FA usage was reported in 40.4% of cases of spina bifida with other anomalies but in only 25.2% of isolated spina bifida cases (P = 0.02). This enrichment for associated anomalies was not noted among cases of anencephaly or of encephalocele. Among the 563 subsequent pregnancies to mothers with previous NTD-affected pregnancies, those taking FA had a 0.4% NTD recurrence rate, but the recurrence without FA was 8.5%. NTDs with other associated findings were less likely to be prevented by FA, suggesting there is a background NTD rate that cannot be further reduced by FA. Nonetheless, the majority (73.9%) of NTDs in pregnancies in which the mothers reported periconceptional FA use were isolated NTDs of usual types. Cases in which FA failed in prevention of NTDs provide potential areas for further study into the causation of NTDs. The measures and techniques implemented in South Carolina can serve as an effective and successful model for prevention of NTD occurrence and recurrence."
24425780,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the period prevalences of ANCA-associated vasculitides (AAV), including granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), eosinophilic GPA (EGPA)/Churg-Strauss and GCA, in an urban and rural population in northern Germany in 2006 and to compare the data with our previous study performed in 1994. METHODS: We identified of all patients with AAV or GCA via questionnaires to all hospital departments, physicians, health insurance providers, pension funds, reference laboratories for autoimmune diseases and death registries in Luebeck (city) and the rural region of Segeberg (population 468 962) between January and December 2006. The type of vasculitis, gender, year of birth, postal code and death were documented and re-evaluated. RESULTS: One-hundred and fifty patients were identified, indicating a prevalence of 320 per million inhabitants for the complete catchment area (95% CI 285, 355). GCA was more prevalent than AAV: 171 (146, 197) vs 149 (126, 174). GCA and AAV have almost doubled since 1994. GCA increased from 240 (164, 315) to 440 (399, 481) per million in the population ≥ 50 years of age and AAV increased from 74 to 149 cases per million. GCA and AAV were more prevalent in the urban compared with the rural region. CONCLUSION: The prevalence rates of AAV and GCA almost doubled from 1994 to 2006 for this region with a stable population and using an identical study design. Increased awareness has led to an earlier diagnosis of systemic vasculitis and improved activity-adapted treatment mostly based on randomized controlled trials has led to longer survival. Aspects such as environmental factors and exposure to certain substances need further research."
14648713,"Brain tumors are some of the most lethal adult cancers and there is a concern that the incidence is increasing. It has been suggested that the reported increased incidence can be explained by improvements in diagnostic procedures, although this has not been totally resolved. The aim of our study was to describe the incidence trends of adult primary intracerebral tumors in four Nordic countries during a period with introduction of new diagnostic procedures and increasing prevalence of mobile phone users. Information about benign and malignant primary intracerebral tumor cases 20-79 years of age was obtained from the national cancer registries in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden for the years 1969-98 and estimates of person-years at risk were calculated from the information obtained from national population registries. Annual age standardized incidence rates per 100,000 person-years were calculated and time trends analyses were carried out using Poisson regression. The overall incidence of all intracerebral tumors ranged from 8.4-11.8 for men and 5.8-9.3 for women, corresponding to an average annual increase of 0.6% for men (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.4, 0.7) and 0.9% for women (95% CI = 0.7, 1.0). The increase in the incidence was confined to the late 1970s and early 1980s and coinciding with introduction of improved diagnostic methods. This increase was largely confined to the oldest age group. After 1983 and during the period with increasing prevalence of mobile phone users, the incidence has remained relatively stable for both men and women."
24794056,"BACKGROUND: The aging congenital heart disease (CHD) population is prone to develop a variety of sequelae, including pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Previous prevalence estimates are limited in applicability due to the use of tertiary centers, or database encoding only. We aimed to investigate the contemporary prevalence of PAH in adult CHD patients, using a nationwide population. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed, using the population-based Dutch CONgenital CORvitia (CONCOR) registry. All patients born with a systemic-to-pulmonary shunt, thereby at risk of developing PAH, were identified. From this cohort, a random sample was obtained and carefully reviewed. RESULTS: Of 12,624 registered adults with CHD alive in 2011, 5,487 (44%) were at risk of PAH. The random sample consisted of 1,814 patients (mean age 40 ± 15 years) and 135 PAH cases were observed. PAH prevalence in patients born with a systemic-to-pulmonary shunt was 7.4%. The prevalence of PAH after corrective cardiac surgery was remarkably high (5.7%). Furthermore, PAH prevalence increased with age, from 2.5% under 30 years until 35% in the eldest. PAH prevalence in the entire CHD population was 3.2%. Based on 3000 per million adult CHD patients in the general population, we can assume that PAH-CHD is present in 100 per million. CONCLUSIONS: This new approach using a nationwide CHD population reports a PAH prevalence of 3.2% in CHD patients, and 100 per million in the general adult population. Especially in patients after shunt closure and the elderly, physicians should be aware of PAH-CHD, to provide optimal therapeutic and clinical care."
9373864,"The 20-year birth prevalence of Down syndrome in Cape Town, South Africa, was determined. All cases delivered to mothers in Cape Town, plus terminations following prenatal diagnosis, between 1 January 1974 and 31 December 1993 were ascertained. There were 784 Down syndrome pregnancies, of which 95% were trisomies. The 32 terminations comprised 18.3% of the white, 5.8% of the coloured (mixed race) and 1.4% of the black cases. The overall prevalence rate was 1.49 per 1000 (white 1.88, coloured 1.54 and black 1.29 per 1000). Analysis for linear trends showed a significant decline in rates for the total population and for whites, a downward trend for coloureds, but no decline for blacks. Over the last 5-year period the prevalence rates in all three population groups were 1.3 per 1000. An increasing risk with advancing maternal age was confirmed, but no maternal age-specific differences in rates by race were demonstrated."
3759416,"A descriptive epidemiological survey of hereditary ataxias and spastic paraplegias was conducted in the province of Torino, Italy (2,327 996 inhabitants). On prevalence day (31 December 1982) 142 patients were alive. Total prevalence was 6.1 cases/100,000 inhabitants (95% confidence limits = 5.1-7.0). The prevalence rate was 2.6 for recessive or sporadic juvenile ataxias, 1.3 for spastic paraplegias, 1.2 for autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias, and 1.1 for late onset cerebellar ataxias. The prevalence of hereditary ataxias is similar in our province to that recorded in other populations, but hereditary spastic paraplegias are less frequent than in other populations."
18494745,"To investigate the epidemiology of aniridia in the populations of Sweden and Norway.A thorough search for aniridia patients has been performed in Sweden and Norway. All participants had a clinical ophthalmological examination documented through photography. Blood samples were taken for mutation analysis and pedigrees were established.A total of 181 patients with aniridia were identified in the two countries. This gives an age-specific prevalence of 1:72,000 in the entire region, 1:70,000 in Sweden and 1:76,000 in Norway. A total of 124 individuals (69%) were examined. Male/female ratio was 0.94 (Sweden 0.85 and Norway 1.2). Mean age of the examined patients was 29 years and median age 25 years. We did not find any significant age difference between the two countries. The mean visual acuity (VA) was 0.19 (Sweden 0.19 and Norway 0.18).The number of families with more than one affected member was 31 and the number of sporadic cases was 40.We have done a thorough search of the literature, but we have found no earlier studies describing aniridia in an entire country and only a few reports from larger areas. We assume that most aniridia patients have been found and the aniridia prevalence of 1:72,000 can be regarded as well supported. Further studies on other aspects of aniridia are in progress, and information from these can contribute to guidelines for the care of patients with this rare but serious disease."
18796143,"BACKGROUND: Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is a rare lysosomal storage disease subdivided into three phenotypes of increasing severity: Scheie, Hurler-Scheie and Hurler. To gauge the effectiveness of treatments and to determine the load likely to fall on health-care systems, it is necessary to understand the prevalence and natural progression of the disease especially with regard to life-expectancy. In general such data on the natural history of lysosomal storage diseases is sparse. METHODS: Analysis of prevalence and patient survival in MPS I disease using a unique longitudinal data set initiated and maintained over a period of more than 20 years by the Society for Mucopolysaccharide Diseases (UK). RESULTS: The birth prevalence of MPS I in England and Wales over the period 1981 to 2003 was 1.07/100,000 births and within +/- 5% of estimates reported in several studies that examined reasonably large populations. The median survival for MPS I patients (including all phenotypes irrespective of various treatments) was found by Kaplan-Meier analysis to be 11.6 years. This result was driven by the relatively poor survival of patients with the Hurler phenotype who, irrespective of any treatments received, had a median survival of 8.7 years; when censoring for receipt of bone marrow transplant (BMT) was implemented median survival of Hurler patients was diminished to 6.8 years. The difference between these survival curves was statistically significant by log rank test and can be attributed to beneficial effects of BMT and or selection of patients with superior prognosis for intervention with BMT. Survival curves for Hurler patients who received and did not receive BMT were very different. Probability of survival at 2 year after BMT was ~68% and was similar to this after 5 years (66%) and ten years (64%); the mean age of Hurler patients at receipt of BMT was 1.33 years (range 0.1 to 3 years). Follow up was insufficient to determine median survival of the milder phenotypes however, unsurprisingly, this was clearly superior to that for Hurler patients. CONCLUSION: The birth prevalence of MPS I in England and Wales is 1.07/100,000 and the median survival for MPS I patients is 11.6 years."
16211610,"In Iceland, the crude prevalence for all types of primary dystonia was 37.1/10(5) (confidence interval, 30.4-44.9). Focal dystonia had the highest prevalence (31.2/10(5)), followed by segmental (3.1/10(5)), multifocal (2.4/10(5)) and generalized dystonia (0.3/10(5)). Cervical dystonia was the most common focal dystonia (11.5/10(5)), followed by limb dystonia (8.0/10(5)), laryngeal dystonia (5.9/10(5)), blepharospasm (3.1/10(5)), and oromandibular dystonia (2.8/10(5)). The male:female ratio for all patients was 1:1.9 (P=0.0007), and females outnumbered males in all subtypes except oromandibular dystonia. Mean age of onset for all patients was 42.7 years (range, 3-82 years). This prevalence of primary dystonia is higher than in most reported studies, possibly because of more complete ascertainment but the relative frequencies of dystonia subtypes is similar."
9450872,"To determine the proportion and birth prevalence of ""typical"" orofacial clefts (cleft lip (CL), cleft palate (CP), cleft lip and palate (CLP)) and ""atypical"" clefts (median, transversal, or oblique facial clefts) and the conditions in which they occur, we analyzed a population-based sample of 4,433 cases ascertained from 2,509,881 California births. We classified cases into: isolated cleft anomalies, sequences of the primary defect, chromosomal aberrations, monogenic syndromes, results of known teratogens, associations, multiple congenital anomaly (MCA) of unknown etiology, or conjoined twins. The birth prevalence of isolated CL+/-P was 0.77 per 1,000 births (CL 0.29/1,000, CLP 0.48/1,000) and of isolated CP, 0.31 per 1,000 births. Non-Hispanic Whites had the greatest prevalence of isolated clefts, Asians slightly lower prevalences, and Blacks the lowest. Asians had the lowest prevalence of Robin sequence and nonHispanic Whites the highest, twice that of Hispanics. Hispanics, followed by Asians, had the highest prevalence of CL+/-P with MCA; non-Hispanic Whites had the lowest. Asians had the lowest prevalence of CP; in Whites and Hispanics it was almost twice as high. Blacks had the highest CL:CLP ratio, followed by non-Hispanic Whites and Asians; Hispanics had the lowest. Isolated anomalies constituted 61.67% of clefts. In the total sample there were 3.9% sequences, 8.79% chromosomal aberrations, 6.02% monogenic syndromes, 0.2% known teratogens, 0.79% associations, 18.55% MCA of unknown etiology, and 0.1% in conjoined twins. This study supports evaluation of each child on a ""case"" level, and provides a framework for genetic counseling and other studies focused on causes and prevention of these serious anomalies."
20417570,"PURPOSE:Autosomal dominant optic atrophy (DOA) is a major cause of visual impairment in young adults that is characterized by selective retinal ganglion cell loss. To define the prevalence and natural history of this optic nerve disorder, we performed a population-based epidemiologic and molecular study of presumed DOA cases in the north of England. DESIGN:Case series. PARTICIPANTS:Seventy-six affected probands with a clinical diagnosis of DOA were identified from our neuro-ophthalmology and neurogenetics database. METHODS:OPA1 genetic testing was performed using a polymerase chain reaction-based sequencing strategy. OPA1-negative cases were then screened for large-scale OPA1 rearrangements and OPA3 mutations. Additional affected family members identified through contact tracing were examined, and longitudinal visual data were analyzed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:The prevalence and molecular characteristics of DOA in the north of England. Visual function and disease progression among patients with OPA1-positive mutations. RESULTS:The detection rate of OPA1 mutations was 57.6% among probands with a positive family history of optic atrophy (19/33) and 14.0% among singleton cases (6/43). Approximately two thirds of our families with DOA harbored OPA1 mutations (14/22, 63.6%), and 5 novel OPA1 mutations were identified. Only 1 family carried a large-scale OPA1 rearrangement, and no OPA3 mutations were found in our optic atrophy cohort. The minimum point prevalence of DOA in the north of England was 2.87 per 100,000 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.54-3.20), or 2.09 per 100,000 (95% CI, 1.95-2.23) when only OPA1-positive cases were considered. Snellen visual acuity varied markedly between OPA1-positive cases with a mean of 20/173 (range 20/20 to hand movements), and visual function worsened in 67.4% of patients during follow-up. The mean rate of visual loss was 0.032 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution per year, but some patients experienced faster visual decline (range = 0-0.171 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution/year). OPA1 missense mutations were associated with a significantly worse visual outcome compared with other mutational subtypes (P=0.0001). CONCLUSIONS:Dominant optic atrophy causes significant visual morbidity and affects at least 1 in 35,000 of the general population."
28986408,"To clarify the prevalence and clinical characteristics of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD) in Japan and compare them with those in other ethnic populations.Data processing sheets were sent to all related institutions in northern Japan and were collected from April to May 2016. Prevalence was determined on March 31, 2016, using the 2015 International Panel for NMO Diagnosis criteria.The crude prevalence was 4.1/100,000 (95% confidence interval 2.2-6.9) for NMOSD in northern Japan, with a significantly higher number of female than male patients (female: male 12:2). The positivity for anti-aquaporin-4 antibody was 78.6%, and the mean age at onset was 45.2 years. All patients were subjected to preventive therapy in the form of treatment with steroids or immunosuppressive agents.Our results showed that the prevalence of NMOSD in the Japanese population is similar to that in Caucasians."
15902550,"Menkes disease (MNK) is a lethal, X-linked recessive disorder of copper metabolism dominated by neurodegenerative symptoms and connective tissue disturbances. The incidence of MNK in Asia is not known. Most patients die by the age of 3 years if adequate treatment is not carried out. Early parenteral administration of copper can prevent the neurological disturbances and lead to a better outcome. In the present study, a survey on MNK in Japan was performed. There were in total 53 live-born Japanese patients with MNK collected from 1990 to 2003, including two females. The incidence of live-born MNK patients between 1992 and 2002 was 2.8 per million live births (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.8 to 3.7), 4.9 per million male live births (95% CI: 3.2 to 6.6). One-third of the patients were born before 37 weeks or weighing less than 2500 g. Seventeen per cent were born both before 37 gestational weeks and weighing less than 2500 g. These proportions were higher than those in Japanese live-birth babies according to a nationwide estimate. The hair on these Japanese patients appeared not only as white or grey but also brown and blond. We also found that many signs had been noted before the patient was brought to a hospital with typical symptoms. These signs may be a clue to early diagnosis of MNK."
8702445,"OBJECTIVE:To investigate a high prevalence of systemic sclerosis (SSc; scleroderma) in a well-defined population of 21,255 Choctaw Indians residing in 8 southeastern Oklahoma counties who were ""users"" of Indian Health Services. METHODS:A case-control study of 12 SSc cases and 48 matched non-SSc controls (4 per case) was conducted to investigate potential occupational, residential, and infectious exposures, as well as genetic factors which might predispose to SSc. HLA class II alleles were determined by DNA oligotyping, and class I and III alleles were defined serologically. RESULTS:The prevalence of SSc in full-blooded Choctaws was at least 8/1,704, or 469/100,000 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 203-930) over the 4-year interval 1990-1994 and was significantly higher than that among non-full-blooded Choctaws (6/19,551, or 31/100,000) (P = 0.00001, odds ratio [OR] = 15.4, 95% CI 4.9-49.8). The overall prevalence of SSc in Oklahoma Choctaws (66/100,000) also was significantly higher than that in other Native Americans in Oklahoma (9.5/100,000) (P = 10(-6), OR = 6.95, 95% CI 3.3-13.7), who showed a prevalence similar to that reported for whites (2.1-25.3/100,000). Among the SSc cases, there was striking homogeneity of disease expression with the majority exhibiting diffuse scleroderma, pulmonary fibrosis, and autoantibodies to topoisomerase I. No environmental exposures were found to be in excess among cases versus controls. The strongest risk factor for SSc in cases (100%) versus controls (54%) was an HLA haplotype bearing the alleles B35, Cw4, DRB1*1602 (DR2), DQA1*0501, and DQB1*0301 (DQ7) (P = 0.002, Pcorr = 0.036, OR = 21, 95% CI 2.9-437). Survey of another group of Choctaws residing in another state revealed no cases of SSc despite a high frequency of the same HLA haplotype. CONCLUSION:Full-blooded Choctaw Native Americans living in southeastern Oklahoma have the highest prevalence of SSc yet found in any population. A major risk factor for disease is a uniquely Amerindian HLA haplotype; however, additional genes and/or an as-yet-unidentified environmental exposure seem likely."
21175790,"Hepatocellular adenoma (HCA) is a benign liver neoplasm with a risk of spontaneous bleeding and malignant transformation. The aim of this review article is to review all the case reports and case series of patients with HCA from 1998 to 2008 in China and other parts of the world in order to compare clinical presentation, surgical management and outcomes. A search for all reports of HCA in the world literature from 1998 to 2008 was performed. A total of 356 patients were identified, including 191 patients from China, 104 from Europe, 46 from North America, and 15 from South-East Asia. A female predominance was not observed in Chinese patients in contrast to the other regions. Acute/chronic abdominal pain was the main clinical presentation in all regions. Twenty patients were diagnosed with coexistent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and hepatitis B virus infection (HBV) was found among six of them. The management of HCA consisted of resection in most cases. The clinical presentation of HCA in China differed from other parts of the world regarding male predominance and a higher incidence of coexistent HCC in China. This might be the result of the birth control policy in China, limited oral contraceptive use, and the higher incidence of HBV."
2938203,"By means of a National Case Register of patients admitted to psychiatric hospitals in Norway it was possible to study the case-histories of the 199 patients admitted from 1916 to 1975 with a diagnosis of Huntington's chorea. Ascertainment is likely to have been most complete for the years 1930-50, when the prevalence rates ranged between 6 and 7 per 100 000 population. The social adjustment of the patients was found to be more favourable than expected up to the onset of serious psychiatric and neurological symptoms. The marriage rate and the rate of reproduction were not lowered. Occupational distribution and the pattern of migration were normal. Depression and suicide were remarkably rare. The age of onset among single patients was nearly 10 years lower than among the married, and more than 13 years lower on admission to hospital, indicating selection for marriage. With a marriage rate of about 70% and the late manifestation of the disease, predictive tests without prospects of treatment are apt to increase significantly the burden on the carriers."
22909047,"CONTEXT: It was previously reported in Korea that there were 1.4 case per million per year of acromegaly. This was low in comparison with the extrapolated values of Western European countries. We expected that the incidence of acromegaly would be much higher now because of recently improved medical facilities, diagnostic tools and coverage of medical insurance to all the population of South Korea. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this nationwide survey was to examine the incidence and prevalence of patients with acromegaly, mode of treatment and outcome of surgical treatment of recent 5 years. DESIGN AND PATIENTS: We requested and collected the medical records of all possible patients with acromegaly from 74 secondary or tertiary medical institutes in Korea from 2003 to 2007 retrospectively. MEASUREMENTS: Date of diagnosis and treatment, tumour size, pre- and postoperative hormonal level, treatment modality and usage of medication were collected. RESULTS: During 5 years, 1350 patients with acromegaly had been registered. The average annual incidence was 3.9 cases per million during this period, and prevalence had increased up to 27.9 cases per million in 2007. Male/female ratio was 1:1.2, and mean age at diagnosis was 44.1 years. Macroadenoma was dominant (82.9%). Transsphenoidal adenoidectomy was used the most as primary treatment (90.4%). CONCLUSIONS: This Korean acromegaly survey offers a realistic overview of the predominant epidemiological characteristics of acromegaly in Korea. Annual incidence was at a similar level with western countries. Efforts to diagnose and control the disease earlier are recommended."
23838025,"OBJECTIVES: To compare the incidence of renal ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) in urban vs more rural populations in northern Saskatchewan, and as a secondary objective to compare time to diagnosis between these geographic areas. METHODS: Northern Saskatchewan has a population of 562,882 of which approximately 260 600 live in the major urban area. A pathology database search for renal biopsy reports suggestive of AAV between January 2007 and December 2011 and subsequent chart review yielded 33 new diagnoses of granulomatosis polyangiitis (GPA) or microscopic polyangiitis (MPA). Data extraction included demographics, residential data, serological status, recorded symptom onset and estimations of BVAS, five-factor score (FFS) and vasculitis damage index (VDI). RESULTS: Of 33 renal AAV cases, 24.2 % (n = 8) lived within the city. The incidence rate for urban residents was 6.1 cases/million/year, and for those residing elsewhere, 16.5 cases/million/year. The odds ratio for the more rural population was 2.69 (95% CI 1.3, 7.5). Mean time to diagnosis was 1.33 (s.d. 0.94) months for urban and 3.52 (s.d. 3.83) months for more rural patients (P = 0.002, 95% CI 0.7, 3.9). Secondary analysis supported these observations with higher BVAS, VDI and FFS scores in patients living outside the urban centre. CONCLUSION: The incidence of renal biopsy-proven AAV was higher in patients living in northern Saskatchewan smaller communities and rural settings. A significantly longer time to diagnosis existed for patients outside the urban centre and was associated with poorer BVAS, VDI and FFS scores."
1842671,"The epidemiology of oral clefts was studied in the geographical area covered by our registry of congenital malformations. For each of the 207 new cases studied during the period 1979 to 1987, more than 50 factors were compared in probands and controls. The incidence of oral clefts was 1.75 per 1000, with cleft lip/palate (CL(P] 0.98 and cleft palate only (CP) 0.77 per 1000. A total of 8.2% of cleft cases were stillbirths and 5.3% were induced abortions. The more common types of associated malformations in the 76 affected cases (36.7%) with at least one anomaly other than oral cleft were neural tube defects and skeletal malformations. At birth, infants with oral clefts and other malformations were smaller, weighed less, and their head circumference was lower than in controls. Placental weight was also lower than in controls. Pregnancies with oral clefts were more often complicated by threatened abortion, polyhydramnios, and arterial hypertension. There was a significant association between clefting and consanguinity; heritability of CL(P) was 81% and first degree relatives of probands had more than three times the prevalence of noncleft malformations as controls. These results are of relevance to genetic counselling."
1419751,"Cases of epidermolysis bullosa (EB) diagnosed in Northern Ireland during a 23-year period (1962-84) were identified from dermatology clinic files, paediatric hospital notes and cases known by general practitioners. A total of 48 confirmed new cases of EB were diagnosed during the screening period. This involved 31 families, with identification of 36 further cases. The distribution of incident EB subtypes was: simplex 31 (65%), junctional 1 (2%), dystrophic 12 (25%) and acquisita 4 (8%). The incidence rate of new cases of EB diagnosed per year is 1.4/million and prevalence of all forms estimated at 32/million. The prevalence of simplex, junctional and dystrophic forms is 28, 0.7 and 3/million, respectively."
26545857,"No population-based surveys of porencephaly, schizencephaly, and hydranencephaly have been conducted in Japan or other Asian countries. We performed a neuroepidemiologic analysis to elucidate the incidence of porencephaly, schizencephaly, and hydranencephaly in Miyagi prefecture, Japan, during 2007-2011.We sent inquiry forms in February 2012 to three neonatal intensive care units, 25 divisions of orthopedic surgery in municipal hospitals, 33 divisions of pediatrics including one university hospital, municipal hospitals, pediatric practitioners, and institutions for physically handicapped children located in Miyagi prefecture. These covered all clinics related to pediatric neurology and orthopedic surgery in Miyagi prefecture. In the inquiry, diagnostic criteria for porencephaly, schizencephaly, and hydranencephaly were described and representative images of magnetic resonance imaging were shown. We obtained an 82% (27 of 33) response rate from the divisions of pediatrics, a 100% (3 of 3) response rate from the neonatal intensive care units, and a 68% (17 of 25) response rate from orthopedic surgery clinics. The magnetic resonance imaging scans of each patient were retrieved and inspected.Five, one, and two individuals developed porencephaly, schizencephaly, and hydranencephaly, respectively. The estimated incidence rates of porencephaly, schizencephaly, and hydranencephaly were 5.2 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.6-9.8), 1.0 (95% CI, 0.0-3.1), and 2.1 (95% CI, 0.0-5.0) per 100,000 live births, respectively.The prevalence rates of porencephaly, schizencephaly, and hydranencephaly at birth reported herein are compatible with results reported previously in the United States and European countries. The overall prevalence rate of these three diseases was 8.3 (95% CI, 2.6-14.1) per 100,000 live births."
21846383,"VACTERL/VATER association is typically defined by the presence of at least three of the following congenital malformations: vertebral defects, anal atresia, cardiac defects, tracheo-esophageal fistula, renal anomalies, and limb abnormalities. In addition to these core component features, patients may also have other congenital anomalies. Although diagnostic criteria vary, the incidence is estimated at approximately 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 40,000 live-born infants. The condition is ascertained clinically by the presence of the above-mentioned malformations; importantly, there should be no clinical or laboratory-based evidence for the presence of one of the many similar conditions, as the differential diagnosis is relatively large. This differential diagnosis includes (but is not limited to) Baller-Gerold syndrome, CHARGE syndrome, Currarino syndrome, deletion 22q11.2 syndrome, Fanconi anemia, Feingold syndrome, Fryns syndrome, MURCS association, oculo-auriculo-vertebral syndrome, Opitz G/BBB syndrome, Pallister-Hall syndrome, Townes-Brocks syndrome, and VACTERL with hydrocephalus. Though there are hints regarding causation, the aetiology has been identified only in a small fraction of patients to date, likely due to factors such as a high degree of clinical and causal heterogeneity, the largely sporadic nature of the disorder, and the presence of many similar conditions. New genetic research methods offer promise that the causes of VACTERL association will be better defined in the relatively near future. Antenatal diagnosis can be challenging, as certain component features can be difficult to ascertain prior to birth. The management of patients with VACTERL/VATER association typically centers around surgical correction of the specific congenital anomalies (typically anal atresia, certain types of cardiac malformations, and/or tracheo-esophageal fistula) in the immediate postnatal period, followed by long-term medical management of sequelae of the congenital malformations. If optimal surgical correction is achievable, the prognosis can be relatively positive, though some patients will continue to be affected by their congenital malformations throughout life. Importantly, patients with VACTERL association do not tend to have neurocognitive impairment."
24272143,"Extracutaneous melanomas are poorly characterized tumors that include ocular (OM), mucosal (MM) and leptomeningeal melanomas, often lacking standardized staging and treatment guidelines. We analyzed cases of cutaneous melanoma (CM, N = 219,890), OM (N = 7,069) and MM (N = 2,755) of different anatomical origins, diagnosed between 1988 and 2010, recorded in the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database. Relative survival was studied in patients grouped by summary stage classification (localized, regional or distant disease) and in multivariate models adjusting for varying distribution of baseline factors. Unlike in CM, the incidence rate in MM increased exponentially with age. Five-year relative survival was significantly worse for OM (78%) and for most mucosal sites (aggregate 34%, range 3-69%) compared with CM (89%). The differences between primary sites were particularly pronounced in localized disease, with a hazard ratio of 5.7 for OM, 4.3-9.0 for external genital or oral cavity MM and 19.8-90.4 for other mucosal locations. Melanomas of the pharynx, gastrointestinal, urinary tract and vagina had poor outcomes regardless of clinical stage. In contrast to CM, there was no evidence of improved survival in OM and MM during the study period. A substantial proportion of patients with operable OM or MM underwent radical organ resections (13-88% depending on site and stage) or perioperative radiotherapy (0-66%). In conclusion, extracutaneous melanomas have a markedly worse survival than CM and aggressive locoregional management appears to be insufficient for their control. Because of poor outcomes in MM, studies of systemic therapy are warranted regardless of the extent of disease at presentation."
4049274,"The incidence of Hirschsprung disease was studied in a series of almost 700,000 consecutive livebirths in British Columbia from 1964-1982, by means of the records of a health surveillance registry that uses multiple sources of ascertainment. The estimated liveborn incidence rate for Hirschsprung disease was 1 in 4,417 livebirths (156 cases out of 689,118 livebirths). Data pertaining to sex ratio, additional anomalies, recurrence, and mortality were also analyzed over the caseload period 1952 to 1983. A total of 29.8% of cases had some additional anomaly--the majority being nonregional anomalies in other systems or more distantly in the gastrointestinal tract. Cardiovascular and gastrointestinal anomalies not a direct consequence of Hirschsprung disease were the most frequent additional anomalies found, occurring in 10 and 12 of 178 cases, respectively. Sensorineural anomalies were also frequent, occurring in 12 of 178 cases. Clinical implications arising from the study regarding the neonatal assessment of infants with these anomalies are discussed."
22909024,"UNLABELLED: DEFINITION OF THE DISEASE: AL amyloidosis results from extra-cellular deposition of fibril-forming monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig) light chains (LC) (most commonly of lambda isotype) usually secreted by a small plasma cell clone. Most patients have evidence of isolated monoclonal gammopathy or smoldering myeloma, and the occurrence of AL amyloidosis in patients with symptomatic multiple myeloma or other B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders is unusual. The key event in the development of AL amyloidosis is the change in the secondary or tertiary structure of an abnormal monoclonal LC, which results in instable conformation. This conformational change is responsible for abnormal folding of the LC, rich in β leaves, which assemble into monomers that stack together to form amyloid fibrils. EPIDEMIOLOGY: AL amyloidosis is the most common type of systemic amyloidois in developed countries with an estimated incidence of 9 cases/million inhabitant/year. The average age of diagnosed patients is 65 years and less than 10% of patients are under 50. CLINICAL DESCRIPTION: The clinical presentation is protean, because of the wide number of tissues or organs that may be affected. The most common presenting symptoms are asthenia and dyspnoea, which are poorly specific and may account for delayed diagnosis. Renal manifestations are the most frequent, affecting two thirds of patients at presentation. They are characterized by heavy proteinuria, with nephrotic syndrome and impaired renal function in half of the patients. Heart involvement, which is present at diagnosis in more than 50% of patients, leading to restrictive cardiopathy, is the most serious complication and engages prognosis. DIAGNOSTIC METHODS: The diagnosis relies on pathological examination of an involved site showing Congo red-positive amyloid deposits, with typical apple-green birefringence under polarized light, that stain positive with an anti-LC antibody by immunohistochemistry and/or immunofluorescence. Due to the systemic nature of the disease, non-invasive biopsies such as abdominal fat aspiration should be considered before taking biopsies from involved organs, in order to reduce the risk of bleeding complications. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: Systemic AL amyloidosis should be distinguished from other diseases related to deposition of monoclonal LC, and from other forms of systemic amyloidosis. When pathological studies have failed to identify the nature of amyloid deposits, genetic studies should be performed to diagnose hereditary amyloidosis. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of AL amyloidosis is based on chemotherapy, aimed at controlling the underlying plasma clone that produces amyloidogenic LC. The hematological response should be carefully checked by serial measurements of serum free LC. The association of an alkylating agent with high-dose dexamethasone has proven to be effective in two thirds of patients and is considered as the current reference treatment. New agents used in the treatment of multiple myeloma are under investigation and appear to increase hematological response rates. Symptomatic measures and supportive care is necessary in patients with organ failure. Noticeably, usual treatments for cardiac failure (i.e. calcium inhibitors, β-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors) are inefficient or even dangerous in patients with amyloid heart disease, that should be managed using diuretics. Amiodarone and pace maker implantation should be considered in patients with rhythm or conduction abnormalities. In selected cases, heart and kidney transplantation may be associated with prolonged patient and graft survival. PROGNOSIS: Survival in AL amyloidosis depends on the spectrum of organ involvement (amyloid heart disease being the main prognosis factor), the severity of individual organs involved and haematological response to treatment."
21745197,"Optic atrophy type 1 (OPA1) gene mutation causes autosomal dominant optic atrophy (ADOA, MIM #165500). Prevalence of ADOA ranges from 1:50,000 in most populations to 1:12,000 in Denmark. Seventy members of nine families were analysed for the presence of OPA1 gene mutations by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct sequencing. We identified three OPA1 gene mutations in 48 patients with variable signs of optic atrophy. Two mutations, c.784-21_784-22insAluYb8 and c.876_878delTGT, were found in two different families. The third mutation, c.869G>A, was found in 28 patients from seven families. The haplotype analysis data suggested that the c.869G>A mutation is a founder mutation. Our main result suggests a higher ADOA prevalence in south-eastern Sicily than previously found in Denmark. This is because of not only the founder effect but also to the presence of three different mutations in the geographical area of the study. Our hypothesis is that a combination of social pressure because of blindness and migration factors is involved. In fact, in Siracusa, a provincial capital in south-eastern Sicily, St. Lucy, the patron saint of the blind was born and died."
8472930,"Autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay (ARSACS) is a disorder that has an elevated frequency in Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean (SLSJ) and Charlevoix, two geographically isolated regions in the past of northeastern Quebec. The incidence at birth and the carrier rate in SLSJ were estimated at 1/1,932 liveborn infants and 1/22 inhabitants, respectively, for the period 1941-1985. The mean inbreeding coefficient was twice higher and the mean kinship coefficient 3 times higher among the ARSACS families than among control families. In the SLSJ region, the birth places of the ARSACS individuals and their parents did not show a clustered distribution. The genealogical reconstruction suggests that the high incidence of ARSACS in SLSJ and Charlevoix is likely to be the result of a founder effect. Because the disease is apparently unknown elsewhere in the world and a high proportion of French Canadians presently living in eastern Quebec have ancestors coming from Perche, a small region in France, it also suggests that a unique mutation accounts for most, if not all, of the ARSACS cases known in these regions."
27307146,"Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) is a congenital defect of the enteric nervous system characterized by a lack of ganglion cells in the distal hindgut. The aim of this study was to assess the birth prevalence, perinatal characteristics, and maternal risk factors in HSCR patients in Sweden.This was a nationwide, population-based, case-control study of all children born in Sweden between 1982 and 2012 and registered in the Swedish Medical Birth Register. Cases were identified in the Swedish National Patient Register and data on potential maternal risk factors and patient characteristics were collected from the Swedish National Patient Register and the Swedish Medical Birth Register. Five age- and sex-matched controls were randomly selected for each case. The association between studied risk factors and HSCR was analyzed using conditional logistic regression to calculate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI).The study population comprised 600 HSCR cases and 3000 controls with a male-to-female ratio of 3.7:1. The birth prevalence of HSCR was 1.91/10 000. Maternal obesity was associated with an increased risk for the child to have HSCR (OR 1.74; CI 1.25-2.44). Children with HSCR were born at an earlier gestational age (OR 1.60; CI 1.18-2.17) than control children. Associated malformations were identified in 34.5% of the cases.This study showed that the Swedish birth prevalence of HSCR was 1.91/10 000. Children with HSCR disease were born at a lower gestational age than controls. Maternal obesity may increase the risk for the child to have HSCR."
15103760,"AIM: To establish the incidence of tumors of the central nervous system (CNS) in the population of Labin area in Istria, Croatia, characterized by very little population migration. METHOD: We retrospectively analyzed data on 175 patients (102 men and 73 women) diagnosed with CNS tumor according to the World Health Organization's diagnostic criteria in the period 1974-2001. Patient data were retrieved from multiple sources: files of general practitioners in Labin area; registers of admissions and discharges of the Pula General Hospital and Rijeka University Hospital Center; and medical records of the Hospital Departments of Neurology, Surgery, Neurosurgery, Oncology and Radiotherapy, and Pathology. Annual incidence, anatomic location, and pathohistological classification of CNS tumors were determined, as well as age at disease onset. RESULTS: Out of 175 subjects, 95 had primary CNS tumors and 80 had metastases. Intracranial tumors were found in 88.4% of patients with primary CNS tumors (annual incidence, 11.8/100000 population) and intraspinal in 11.6% of patients (annual incidence, 1.6/100000). Similar distribution was observed for CNS metastases (70 intracranial vs 10 intraspinal), with annual incidence of 9.9 and 1.4/100000, respectively. The most frequent intracranial tumors were those of neuroepithelial tissue, accounting for 58.3% of all CNS neoplasms (annual incidence, 6.9/100000 population). The most frequent intraspinal tumors were tumors of the meninges (54.5%). There was no particular temporal clustering of CNS tumors. The age at disease onset corresponded with that reported in the literature: 50.5+/-17.0 years for primary intracranial tumors, and 59.7+/-12.2 years for primary intraspinal tumors. CONCLUSION: Primary CNS tumors showed high, but temporally stable incidence in population of Labin area over the last 27 years, indicating that the alleged increase in CNS tumors incidence was not true."
22970607,"GRACILE syndrome belongs to the Finnish disease heritage, and is caused by a point mutation in the BCS1L-gene encoding a mitochondrial protein. This leads to dysfunction of the complex III in the respiratory chain. Significant fetal growth disturbance is the primary manifestation. Within the first day the newborn infant develops severe lactic acidosis. Hypoglycemia, elevated serum ferritin and conjugated bilirubin values and aminoaciduria imply mitochondrial liver disease and renal tubulopathy. In Finland, the diagnosis is based on the 232A>G mutation in the BCS1L-gene. No specific treatment is available. GRACILE syndrome leads to early death."
9771771,"OBJECTIVES:To perform a comprehensive survey of myasthenia gravis in the county of Cambridgeshire, England, establishing contemporary epidemiological data. METHODS:Cases were ascertained from multiple sources. Prevalent patients were visited and assessed by means of a standardised questionnaire and examination complemented by review of medical case notes. RESULTS:One hundred cases were identified in a population of 684000 (prevalence 15 per 100000 population, 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) 12-18). Thirty eight new diagnoses were made over a five year period providing an incidence of 1.1/100000 population/year. The sex ratio was 2:1 F:M. After a mean follow up of 11.7 years, symptomatic disease was still restricted to ocular muscles in 25 patients. Thirty four of 100 patients underwent thymectomy a mean of 0.8 years after presentation, and a thymoma was present in 12. Highest remission rates were seen in patients presenting with generalised disease who underwent thymectomy but did not have a thymoma (27%). Cosegregation of an additional autoimmune disease occurred in 27 patients and in 24/49 (49%) women with onset<50 years of age. CONCLUSIONS:This, the second highest reported prevalence for myasthenia, is likely to be the result of optimum case ascertainment, increased disease duration, application of complex diagnostic tests, and the impact of an aging population leading to a relative increase in the prevalence of ocular myasthenia."
18618372,"OBJECTIVE: Enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphomas (EATLs) are T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas of the small bowel, which are specifically associated with coeliac disease (CD). To our knowledge no studies have previously reported on the overall incidence of EATLs in the general population. The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of EATL and the demographic characteristics of patients with EATL in The Netherlands. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A survey of the nation-wide network and registry of histo- and cytopathology reports in The Netherlands (PALGA) was performed. We included all T-cell lymphomas detected between January 2000 and December 2006 that initially presented in the small bowel. Crude and world standardized incidence rates were computed as well as gender- and age-specific incidence rates. Finally, the distribution of characteristics such as the localization, the Marsh classification and method of diagnosis are described. RESULTS: Clinicopathological data were gathered for 116 cases of EATL. The mean age at primary presentation of EATL was 64 years. The crude incidence in the total Dutch population was 0.10/100,000 with an incidence of 2.08/100,000 in the over 50-year-olds. Age-specific incidences were 1.44/100,000 in the 50-59 years age group, 2.92/100,000 in the 60-69 years age group, and 2.53/100,000 in the 70-79 years age group. There was a significant predominance of males (64%, p=0.004, CI 54-72); above the age of 50 the gender-specific incidence was 2.95/100,000 in males versus 1.09/100,000 in females. Most EATLs were localized in the proximal small intestine and the diagnosis was made by surgical resection in the majority of cases. CONCLUSIONS: EATL is a rare disease with an incidence of 0.10 per 100,000 inhabitants per year, occurring in older age, with a peak incidence in the 7th decade. The tumour is mainly localized in the proximal small intestine. Although uncomplicated CD is twice as frequent in female patients, EATL is more prevalent in males."
16859601,"During the past 15 years, the epidemiology of Wegener's granulomatosis (WG) has become better understood. Descriptive epidemiological studies carried out primarily in European countries estimate a prevalence of WG ranging from 24 to 157 per million and annual incidence rates from 3 to 14 per million. These studies suggest a North-South declining gradient in disease risk in the Northern Hemisphere and an increase in incidence over time, although the latter is likely largely due to improved diagnostic ascertainment. Data also indicate the presence of potential secular and seasonal variations in WG incidence and a decreasing disease risk among non-Caucasians. Furthermore, analytic epidemiological studies have pointed out putative genetic and non-genetic risk factors for WG. Genetic investigations have identified various candidate genes, with alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency being the most consistently reported genetic susceptibility factor to date. Even though much less research has been devoted to environmental risk factors, evidence has grown for a possible relationship between WG and occupational exposure to crystalline silica. Thus far, data support the concept of WG as a multifactorial disease in which genetic and environmental determinants are involved but a major gap in understanding persists regarding the extent to which both factors contribute to its development. This and many other questions remain to be answered by future structured epidemiological research. This review focuses on the current knowledge of descriptive epidemiology and genetic and environmental factors associated with WG."
10321364,"To determine the prevalence of haemoglobinopathies and the need for neonatal screening for haemoglobinopathies in Brussels.Between December 1994 and June 1998 23,136 cord blood samples obtained in eight hospital nurseries of Brussels were systematically screened for haemoglobinopathies by isoelectric focusing.45% of the newborns were from regions at risk for haemoglobinopathies. Sickle cell disease was diagnosed for 11 neonates (0.048%) and beta thalassaemia major for one neonate. Three hundred and fifty neonates (1.5%) were carriers for a haemoglobin variant, and Hb Bart's was found in 672 cases (2.9%). These prevalences are similar to those reported elsewhere in northern Europe.These results confirm the value of universal screening for haemoglobinopathies in Brussels."
7815200,"OBJECTIVE:To evaluate the efficacy and efficiency of newborn screening for classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) in New Zealand. DESIGN:All infants younger than 6 weeks of age identified by newborn screening between December 1984 and December 1993 were included. RESULTS:23 cases of classic CAH (20 salt-losers) were identified. The incidence of classic CAH was 1 in 23,344. Screening identified 3 of 9 virilized female infants whose disease had not been detected clinically. Screening alone identified all 11 male infants. Notification of cases occurred at 11 +/- 3 days of age. There was a delay in treatment of the group identified by screening alone (n = 14) until 13 days of age (range, 4 to 35 days); at that time 11 infants had hyponatremia and 10 had hyperkalemia. Symptoms of vomiting, poor feeding, and shock were common after 10 days of age (2/10, < 10 days, and 8/8, 11 to 16 days of age). CONCLUSIONS:Newborn CAH screening is the only method of identifying male infants with classic CAH without a family history of CAH before symptoms develop, as well as a significant portion of overlooked virilized female infants. So that clinical or significant biochemical deterioration can be avoided, pediatrician notification of screening results and treatment should be started before 10 days of age."
23301116,"BACKGROUND: Alveolar echinococcosis (AE) caused by Echinococcus multilocularis infections is a dangerous old disease in the Northern Hemisphere. The aim of the paper was to collect and analyze data on human AE in Poland in the last two decades. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The sources of data were both the cases officially registered and detected by an active field and laboratory surveillance. The cases were verified by clinical, epidemiological, and laboratory criteria. Altogether 121 human cases of AE were detected. Among these 83 (68,6%) cases were classified as confirmed, 16 as probable and 22 as possible. During the two decades a continuous increase in detection rate was noticed. The cases were 6-82 years old at the time of diagnosis (mean - 47.7 years). Sex ratio M/F was 0.86/1.0. The AE was fatal in 23 (19%) patients (mean age at death - 54.1 years). Family agglomeration of AE was found in 4 foci, involving 9 patients. Seventy six of the cases were diagnosed in an advanced stage of disease. In all cases the liver was the primary location of AE. In 30 (24.8%) patients a spread to other organs was observed. Ninety four of the patients were treated with albendazole. In 73 (60%) patients a surgical operation was performed, including 15 liver transplantations. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The studies confirmed that AE is an emerging disease in Poland, which is the fourth country in Europe with over 120 cases detected. The results also indicate the need of a wider national programme for implementation of screening in the highest AE risk areas (north-eastern Poland) with an effort to increase the public awareness of the possibility of contracting E. multilocularis, and above all, training of the primary care physicians in the recognition of the risk of AE to allow for an early detection of this dangerous disease."
9521938,"OBJECTIVE:To assess results of newborn screening for 21-hydroxylase-deficient congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) in Texas over 6 years of screening 1.9 million infants. METHODS:In 1989, CAH was incorporated into the ongoing Texas Newborn Screening Program, which requires two screens on each newborn. 17-Hydroxyprogesterone was assayed, without extraction, by radioimmunoassay of blood collected from heel sticks onto filter paper collection cards. Infants with elevated levels of 17-hydroxyprogesterone were referred for evaluation, and those considered to have CAH were studied with respect to disease characteristics. Data were collected by pediatric endocrinologists using standardized forms that included type of CAH, results of laboratory tests, treatment regimen, disease symptoms and signs, and, for girls, degree of genital virilization. RESULTS:The incidence of classic CAH in Texas is 1:16 008, with a ratio of salt-wasting to simple-virilizing of 2.7:1. A majority of infants detected were undiagnosed until screened, despite signs of salt-wasting or ambiguous genitalia. It was difficult to differentiate salt-wasting from simple-virilizing CAH in infants who were identified before the onset of adrenal insufficiency or electrolyte abnormalities. A substantial number of infants with nonclassic (NC) CAH also were detected. Not all infants were detected on the initial screen; 14% of infants with classic CAH and 87% with NC CAH were detected on the second routine screening test. CONCLUSIONS:Our findings confirm the benefits of newborn screening for CAH and the importance of a second screening test, and suggest that programs for newborn CAH screening must consider complex issues in diagnosis and treatment. These results also confirm that CAH is a continuum of disorders, rather than a disorder with discrete subtypes. In addition, the difficulties in differentiating CAH subtypes in newborns, and thus deciding appropriate treatment, and the high incidence of NC CAH suggest that standard diagnostic criteria and treatment regimens for CAH may need modification. Where screening exists, physicians will encounter more cases of CAH than in the past."
20214678,"Few studies are carried out on the epidemiology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in Middle East with no reports from Iran.To determine the epidemiological and clinical features of ALS amongst the Iranian population living in Isfahan, Iran.Medical records of all hospitals with a neurology department and outpatient neurology clinics in Isfahan province from 2002 to 2006 were reviewed, and all patients with the diagnosis of ALS according to El Escorial diagnostic criteria were extracted and related demographic and clinical data were gathered and analyzed.We found 98 new patients (66 men and 32 women) with definite, probable, or possible ALS. The average annual incidence was 0.42/100,000, with the highest incidence rate amongst those aged 70-74. On 21 March 2006, the crude prevalence was 1.57/100,000. Median survival from onset was 48 months (95% confidence interval 34-61) and survival rates for 1, 3,and 5 years after the onset were 94%, 66%, and 32%, respectively.The incidence and prevalence of ALS in the Iranian population seems to be lower compared to other populations and the survival of patients was longer than previously reported."
17313496,"OBJECTIVES: The epidemiology of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) has been incompletely assessed by population-based studies. We therefore conducted a population-based study to determine: (a) incidence rates of large and small duct PSC in adults and children, (b) the risk of inflammatory bowel disease on developing PSC, and (c) patterns of clinical presentation with the advent of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP). METHODS: All residents of the Calgary Health Region diagnosed with PSC between 2000 and 2005 were identified by medical records, endoscopic, diagnostic imaging, and pathology databases. Demographic and clinical information were obtained. Incidence rates were determined and risks associated with PSC were reported as rate ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: Forty-nine PSC patients were identified for an age- and gender-adjusted annual incidence rate of 0.92 cases per 100,000 person-years. The incidence of small duct PSC was 0.15/100,000. In children the incidence rate was 0.23/100,000 compared with 1.11/100,000 in adults. PSC risk was similar in Crohn's disease (CD; RR 220.0, 95% CI 132.4-343.7) and ulcerative colitis (UC; RR 212.4, 95% CI 116.1-356.5). Autoimmune hepatitis overlap was noted in 10% of cases. MRCP diagnosed large duct PSC in one-third of cases. Delay in diagnosis was common (median 8.4 months). A minority had complications at diagnosis: cholangitis (6.1%), pancreatitis (4.1%), and cirrhosis (4.1%). CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric cases and small duct PSC are less common than adult large duct PSC. Surprisingly, the risk of developing PSC in UC and CD was similar. Autoimmune hepatitis overlap was noted in a significant minority of cases."
10770176,"The objective of the present study was to determine the incidence of pituitary adenomas (PAs) and the associated rates and causes of mortality in a large population. The study population comprised 2279 patients (1010 women and 1269 men) of all individuals (n = 3321) with pituitary tumors included in the Swedish Cancer Registry between 1958 and 1991. The mean age (+/-SD) at diagnosis was 52.3 +/-15.7 yr. The age-standardized incidence of PA increased significantly from approximately 6 cases/million inhabitants in 1958 to 11 cases/ million in 1991. The age-specific incidence peaked between 60-70 yr of age in both sexes. Excess mortality was found in the study population. The total number of deaths was 842. The standardized mortality ratio (SMR) for the study population was 2.0. The SMR for women (2.3) was significantly (P < 0.01) higher than that for men (1.9). Cardiovascular diseases were the most common cause of mortality among patients, accounting for 346 deaths (SMR, 1.6). The difference between the sexes was significant (men, 1.4; women, 1.8; P < 0.05). Cerebrovascular death occurred in 97 patients (SMR, 2.4), with no significant difference between men (SMR, 2.5) and women (SMR, 2.2). Excess mortality was also observed for tumors, endocrine diseases, and gastrointestinal diseases. These findings suggest that the annual incidence of PA is increasing. Possible explanations are improved diagnostic skill and/or increased awareness of pituitary diseases among physicians. However, a real increase in the incidence of PA cannot be ruled out."
22234154,"The aim of this study is to quantify the prevalence and types of rare chromosome abnormalities (RCAs) in Europe for 2000-2006 inclusive, and to describe prenatal diagnosis rates and pregnancy outcome. Data held by the European Surveillance of Congenital Anomalies database were analysed on all the cases from 16 population-based registries in 11 European countries diagnosed prenatally or before 1 year of age, and delivered between 2000 and 2006. Cases were all unbalanced chromosome abnormalities and included live births, fetal deaths from 20 weeks gestation and terminations of pregnancy for fetal anomaly. There were 10,323 cases with a chromosome abnormality, giving a total birth prevalence rate of 43.8/10,000 births. Of these, 7335 cases had trisomy 21,18 or 13, giving individual prevalence rates of 23.0, 5.9 and 2.3/10,000 births, respectively (53, 13 and 5% of all reported chromosome errors, respectively). In all, 473 cases (5%) had a sex chromosome trisomy, and 778 (8%) had 45,X, giving prevalence rates of 2.0 and 3.3/10,000 births, respectively. There were 1,737 RCA cases (17%), giving a prevalence of 7.4/10,000 births. These included triploidy, other trisomies, marker chromosomes, unbalanced translocations, deletions and duplications. There was a wide variation between the registers in both the overall prenatal diagnosis rate of RCA, an average of 65% (range 5-92%) and the prevalence of RCA (range 2.4-12.9/10,000 births). In all, 49% were liveborn. The data provide the prevalence of families currently requiring specialised genetic counselling services in the perinatal period for these conditions and, for some, long-term care."
20514305,"Despite remarkable progress in understanding and treating gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) during the past two decades, the pathological characteristics of GISTs have not been made clear yet. Furthermore, concrete diagnostic criteria of malignant GISTs are still uncertain. We collected pathology reports of 1,227 GISTs from 38 hospitals in Korea between 2003 and 2004 and evaluated the efficacy of the NIH and AFIP classification schemes as well as the prognostic factors among pathologic findings. The incidence of GISTs in Korea is about 1.6 to 2.2 patients per 100,000. Extra-gastrointestinal GISTs (10.1%) are more common in Korea than in Western countries. In univariate analysis, gender, age, tumor location, size, mitosis, tumor necrosis, vascular and mucosal invasions, histologic type, CD34 and s-100 protein expression, and classifications by the NIH and AFIP criteria were found to be significantly correlated with patient's survival. However, the primary tumor location, stage and classification of the AFIP criteria were prognostically significant in predicting patient's survival in multivariate analysis. The GIST classification based on original tumor location, size, and mitosis is more efficient than the NIH criteria in predicting patient's survival, but the mechanism still needs to be clarified through future studies."
22247246,"OBJECTIVE: To describe prevalence, prenatal diagnosis and epidemiological data on oesophageal atresia from 23 well-defined European regions and compare the prevalence between these regions. DESIGN: Population-based study using data from a large European database for surveillance of congenital anomalies (EUROCAT) for two decades (1987-2006). SETTINGS: Twenty-three participating registries based on multiple sources of information including information about live births, fetal deaths with gestational age ≥20 weeks and terminations of pregnancy. PATIENTS: 1222 cases of oesophageal atresia in a population of 5 019 804 births. RESULTS: The overall prevalence was 2.43 cases per 10 000 births (95% CI 2.30 to 2.57). There were regional differences in prevalence ranging from 1.27 to 4.55. Prenatal detection rates varied by registry from >50% of cases to <10% of cases. A total of 546 cases (44.7%) had an isolated oesophageal anomaly, 386 (31.6%) were multiple malformed and 290 (23.7%) had an association or a syndrome. There were 1084 live born cases (88.7%), 43 cases were fetal deaths and 95 cases were terminations of pregnancy. One-week survival for live births was 86.9% and 99.2% if the gestational age was ≥38 weeks and isolated oesophageal atresia was present. Males accounted for 57.3% of all cases and 38.5% of live born cases were born with gestational age <37 weeks. CONCLUSION: There were regional differences in prevalence of oesophageal atresia in Europe. Half of all cases had associated anomalies. Prenatal detection rate increased from 26% to 36.5% over the two decades. Survival in infants with isolated oesophageal atresia born at term is high."
9678700,"We have reviewed all known UK cases of Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome. Among 49 cases with proven 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase deficiency, half had been terminated or had died in infancy. The minimum incidence is 1 in 60,000. The frequent occurrence of hypospadias may account for 71% of recognised cases being male. Important common features which emerged include short thumbs, severe photosensitivity, aggressive behaviour, and atrioventricular septal defect. The typical facial appearance becomes less obvious with age and 20% of cases did not have 2/3 toe syndactyly. Biochemical measurements of serum 7-dehydrocholesterol did not correlate with clinical severity."
22846726,"BACKGROUND/AIM: We describe the incidence of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) in a large United States cohort. METHODS: Between 2000 and 2009, we identified visits with an ICD-9 code for GBS (357.0) from all persons with continuous enrollment for at least 1 year. The primary case definition was restricted to emergency department and inpatient visits. We calculated age-standardized rates and used multivariate Poisson regression to assess variation in rates by sex, age, season and year of diagnosis. We tabulated descriptive characteristics and the positive predictive value (PPV) for a subset of the visits with available medical record review. RESULTS: 1,619 visits with the GBS ICD-9 code were identified from 50,290,898 person-years of observation. After considering the PPV (55%) for record-reviewed visits, the age-standardized incidence rate was approximately 1.72/100,000 person-years. The rate was 40% higher for males and increased by 50% for every 10-year increase in age. The rate was 15% higher in winter and spring compared with summer. Rates were higher in more recent years. CONCLUSIONS: GBS rates are higher in males and increase considerably with age. The potential reasons for differences in rates by season and the increased rates in more recent years should be further investigated."
23859338,"Combining data from epidemiological studies in Friedreich's Ataxia (FRDA) and patient organization membership lists, shows that FRDA prevalence exhibits large regional differences in Europe with a prevalence gradient from west to east. Highest levels are observed in northern Spain, south of France and Ireland, lowest levels in Scandinavia and Russia. The observed distribution of FRDA in Europe co-localizes with the gradient of the chromosomal R1b marker as detected within west Europe. This gradient is either derived from Palaeolithic migrations out of the Franco-Cantabrian Ice age refuge or from Neolithic migrations entering west Europe with the advance of agriculture. FRDA prevalence may have been increased in this population anytime after its separation from the closely related R1a carrying group. East European populations with a high frequency of the R1a marker show 10 fold lower prevalence of FRDA, indicating that the FRDA mutation was present in the common ancestor and was increased in the R1b carrying group. The FRDA carrying population went through a Palaeolithic population bottleneck supporting the view that the observed FRDA distribution and potentially the R1b distribution are derived from Palaeolithic migrations out of the Franco-Cantabrian ice age refuge."
20482598,"the frequency of different Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) genotypes has been estimated in clinic populations, but prevalence data from the general population are lacking.our population-based genetic epidemiological survey included persons with CMT residing in eastern Akershus County, Norway. The participants were interviewed and examined by one geneticist/neurologist and classified clinically, neurophysiologically and genetically.two hundred and forty-five persons from 116 families had CMT. This corresponds to 1 per 1214 persons (95% CI 1062-1366) have CMT in the general population. CMT1 (motor conduction velocity (MCV) <38 m/s), CMT2 (MCV >38 m/s) and CMT intermediate (MCV 25-45 m/s) were found in 48.2%, 49.4% and 2.4% of the families. A total of 27.2% of the families and 28.6% of the affected had a mutation in the investigated CMT genes. The prevalence of the peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) duplication and point mutation in the connexin32 (Cx32), myelin protein zero (MPZ) and mitofusin2 (MFN2) genes was found in 13.6%, 6.2%, 1.2%, 6.2% of the families, and in 19.6%, 4.8%, 1.1%, 3.2% of the affected, respectively. None of the families had point mutations in the early growth response 2 (EGR2), PMP22 or small integral membrane protein of lysosome/late endosome (SIMPLE) genes.CMT is the most common inherited neuropathy. At present, 43 CMT genes are known, and an examination of all known genes would probably only identify mutations in approximately 50% of those with CMT. Thus, it is probable that at least 30-50 CMT genes are yet to be identified."
20534753,"CONTEXT: Data on the incidence of pituitary adenomas (PAs) are scant and outdated. A population-based regional cohort with thorough case identification was used to evaluate the incidence of clinically detected PAs in the era of magnetic resonance imaging. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to describe the age- and sex-specific incidence of all PA subgroups, with data on incidentally found PAs, pituitary apoplexies, and time trends. DESIGN, SETTINGS, AND PATIENTS: This was a retrospective descriptive analysis of PA patients diagnosed during 1992-2007 in Northern Finland (NFi). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: World Health Organization 2000-standardized incidence rates (SIRs) of PAs per 100,000 were measured. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The final cohort consisted of 355 PAs. The incidence rates of the Oulu University Hospital regional district were used as a reference to assess the applicability of our case finding over the rest of NFi. Incidence rates of all PA subgroups except microprolactinomas were statistically equal between these areas; thus, all presented SIRs are based on the NFi's cohort except Oulu University Hospital regional district-based prolactinomas and PAs overall. Overall SIR of PAs was higher (4.0 per 100,000) than in previous reports. Prolactinomas had the highest SIR: 2.2 per 100,000, followed by clinically nonfunctioning PAs (1.0) and GH-secreting (0.34), ACTH-secreting (0.17), and TSH-secreting (0.03) PAs. The gender-specific SIR was 2.2 per 100,000 in males and 5.9 per 100,000 in females. Pituitary apoplexy occurred as a presenting symptom in 11% of clinically nonfunctioning PA patients. The SIR of incidentally discovered PAs increased significantly from 1992-1999 to 2000-2007 (0.59 to 1.6, respectively; P < 0.01), which accounted for the perceived increasing trend in the overall SIR of PAs (3.8 to 4.2; P > 0.05)."
23809583,"BACKGROUND: Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB) is a rare disease that represents a heavy burden for both the patient and the health care system. There are currently no data on the prevalence of DEB in Spain. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of DEB in Spain. METHODS: We used data from 3 incomplete population-based sources (hospital dermatology departments, diagnostic laboratories performing antigenic mapping, genetic testing or both, and the Spanish Association of Epidermolysis Bullosa Patients [DEBRA]) and combined them using the 3-source capture-recapture methodology. RESULTS: We identified 152 living DEB patients. The estimated prevalence of DEB was 6.0 cases per million (95% CI, 4.2-11.8) in adults and 15.3 (95% CI, 10.4-40.8) in children under 18 years of age. The data indicated that 77% of the patients were not being followed up in specialized centers of reference; 65% had not had a genetic diagnosis, and 76% were not members of DEBRA. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of DEB in Spain is 6.0 patients per million (95% CI, 4.2-11.8), a figure higher than previous estimates in many areas, but similar to those found in other southern Europe countries. The north-south difference may represent real geographic differences in prevalence, but it might be due to the fact that most of the data come from registries with a lower than expected catchment. Many patients are not being followed up in centers of reference, do not have genetic diagnosis, and are not members of patients' associations, suggesting that there is room for considerable improvement in their care."
21364698,"Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is the most common adult-onset muscular dystrophy with an estimated prevalence of 1/8000. There are two genetically distinct types, DM1 and DM2. DM2 is generally milder with more phenotypic variability than the classic DM1. Our previous data on co-segregation of heterozygous recessive CLCN1 mutations in DM2 patients indicated a higher than expected DM2 prevalence. The aim of this study was to determine the DM2 and DM1 frequency in the general population, and to explore whether the DM2 mutation functions as a modifier in other neuromuscular diseases (NMD) to account for unexplained phenotypic variability. We genotyped 5535 Finnish individuals: 4532 normal blood donors, 606 patients with various non-myotonic NMD, 221 tibial muscular dystrophy patients and their 176 healthy relatives for the DM2 and DM1 mutations. We also genotyped an Italian idiopathic non-myotonic proximal myopathy cohort (n = 93) for the DM2 mutation. In 5496 samples analyzed for DM2, we found three DM2 mutations and two premutations. In 5511 samples analyzed for DM1, we found two DM1 mutations and two premutations. In the Italian cohort, we identified one patient with a DM2 mutation. We conclude that the DM2 mutation frequency is significantly higher in the general population (1/1830; P-value = 0.0326) than previously estimated. The identification of DM2 mutations in NMD patients with clinical phenotypes not previously associated with DM2 is of particular interest and is in accord with the high overall prevalence. On the basis of our results, DM2 appears more frequent than DM1, with most DM2 patients currently undiagnosed with symptoms frequently occurring in the elderly population."
22633354,"PURPOSE: To estimate the prevalence, genotype, and clinical spectrum of Best vitelliform macular dystrophy (Best disease). DESIGN: Retrospective epidemiologic and clinical and molecular genetic observational study. METHODS: setting: National referral center. participants: Forty-five individuals diagnosed with Best disease. observation procedures: Retrospective review of patients diagnosed according to clinical findings and sequencing of BEST1. Patients with recently established molecular genetic diagnosis were followed up including multifocal electroretinography (mfERG), spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), and fundus autofluorescence (FAF) imaging. main outcome measures:BEST1 mutations, SD-OCT and FAF findings, mfERG amplitudes, prevalence estimate of Best disease. RESULTS: BEST1 mutations described previously in Danish patients with Best disease are reviewed. In addition, we identified a further 8 families and 1 sporadic case, in whom 6 BEST1 missense mutations were found, 4 of which are novel. The mutation c.904G>T (p.Asp302Asn) was identified in members of 4 unrelated families. Structural alterations ranged from precipitate-like alterations at the level of the photoreceptor outer segments (OS) to choroidal neovascularization. The extent of the former correlated with the reduction of retinal function. A prevalence estimate of Best disease in Denmark based on the number of diagnosed cases was 1.5 per 100 000 individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Our data expand the mutation spectrum of BEST1 in patients with Best disease. Alterations of the OS overlying lesions with subretinal fluid are similar to those seen in central serous retinopathy and may indicate impaired turnover of OS. Our frequency estimate confirms that Best disease is one of the most common causes of early macular degeneration."
26187053,"Relapsing polychondritis is a rare disease characterized by cartilage inflammation. Our aim was to estimate the incidence, prevalence and mortality of relapsing polychondritis and describe the clinical features of relapsing polychondritis in a large population.All participants diagnosed with relapsing polychondritis were sampled from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink. Prevalence and incidence rates for 1990-2012 were estimated. Relative mortality rates were estimated in a time-to-event framework using reference UK life tables. A questionnaire validation study assessed diagnostic accuracy.There were 117 participants with relapsing polychondritis ever recorded. Fifty (82%) of 61 cases were validated by a physician and unconfirmed cases were excluded. The analysis included 106 participants (42 men, 64 women) diagnosed with relapsing polychondritis. The mean age (range) at diagnosis in men was 55 (range 17-81) years and in women 51 (range 11-79) years. The median interval from first symptom to diagnosis was 1.9 years. The incidence of relapsing polychondritis between 1990 and 2012 was 0.71 (95% CI 0.55, 0.91) per million population per year. There were 19 deaths from any cause. There were 16 observed deaths eligible for survival analysis and 7.4 deaths expected for the UK population of the same age, sex and period. The standardized mortality ratio was 2.16 (95% CI 1.24, 3.51), P < 0.01. Respiratory disease, cardiac conditions and cancer were the most frequent causes of death.The incidence of relapsing polychondritis may be lower than previously estimated, and diagnostic misclassification and delay are common. Mortality in relapsing polychondritis is more than twice that of the general population."

PATIENTS AND METHODS:We analyzed all cases of PNETs registered in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database from 1973 to 2000. Age-adjusted incidence and survival rates were calculated and survival trends over time were evaluated. RESULTS:We identified 1483 cases of PNETs. The crude annual incidence per 1,000,000 was 1.8 in females and 2.6 in males and increased with advancing age. The incidence increased over the study period. Most patients (90.8%) had nonfunctional tumors. Advanced stage, higher grade, and age were the strongest predictors of worse survival. Patients with functional tumors had better outcomes than patients with nonfunctional tumors in both univariate and multivariate analysis (P = 0.004). Survival time increased over the period from 1973 to 2000. No differences were seen in the distribution of stage or age at diagnosis among time periods. CONCLUSION:PNETs are uncommon neoplasms but the incidence may be increasing. Age, grade, stage, and functional status predict survival in patients with PNETs. Survival has improved over time, but this is not explained by earlier diagnosis or stage migration."
23351985,"Epidemiologic investigations of congenital neutropenia aim to determine several important indicators related to the disease, such as incidence at birth, prevalence, and outcome in the population, including the rate of severe infections, leukemia, and survival. Genetic diagnosis is an important criterion for classifying patients and reliably determining the epidemiologic indicators. Patient registries were developed in the 1990s. The prevalence today is probably more than 10 cases per million inhabitants. The rate of infection and leukemia risk can now be calculated. Risk factors for leukemia seem to depend on both the genetic background and cumulative dose of granulocyte colony stimulating factor."
23921495,"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of acquired angioedema (AAE) is hitherto unknown and, to date, less than 200 patients have been reported worldwide. AAE is associated with lymphoproliferative conditions and autoantibodies against C1 inhibitor (C1INH). Rituximab (RTX) is increasingly used in the treatment of AAE patients. METHODS: A nationwide study of AAE patients was performed in Denmark. Clinical features, associated disorders, treatments and outcomes were registered. RESULTS: Eight AAE patients were identified. The diagnostic delay was on average 1 year and 8 months. Patients were treated with C1INH concentrate or icatibant on demand. Six patients were diagnosed with a clonal B-cell disorder during follow-up, on average 2.5 years after the first swelling. Two patients had monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL). Two patients received RTX. CONCLUSIONS: AAE is a rare condition occurring in less than 10% of patients with C1INH deficiency in Denmark. AAE is highly associated with haematologic disorders, and we recommend yearly follow-up visits with clinical examination and blood tests including flow cytometry to diagnose B-cell conditions at an early stage. We report 2 patients with AAE and associated MBL, which is a benign expansion of clonal B lymphocytes. MBL can be the precursor of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia or is associated with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. If angioedema is poorly controlled with standard treatment regimens, we suggest treatment of the associated haematologic disorder. Based on a review of the literature and our own data, we recommend therapy with RTX, especially in patients with anti-C1INH autoantibodies."
15921246,"INTRODUCTION: Tripler Army Medical Center (TAMC) in Honolulu, Hawaii, is uniquely situated to serve patients from the United States Associated Pacific Islands (USAPIs) through the congressionally funded Pacific Island Health Care Project (PIHCP). Because of time differences and distance, a web-based store-and-forward consultation and referral network was established using the internet to more efficiently and economically facilitate patient care. Using both electronic and hard copy records, we sought to establish the incidence of Hirschsprung Disease (HD) in children from the USAPI and contrast it to that of the developed world. METHODS: PIHCP website records as well as all the inpatient and outpatient medical records of patients referred to TAMC fortreatment of HD from 1994 to 2002 were reviewed. A diagnosis of HD was confirmed in all cases with full thickness biopsy. Incidence figures for HD are based on this review and on the birth rates for these islands from the International Data Base of the U.S. Bureau of the Census. RESULTS: There were 14 cases of short-segment HD referred over a nine year study period. Nine patients came from the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) with an average annual incidence of 1:3190, which is 1.5 to 2 times the reported incidence in Western nations. Remarkably, seven of these nine were from Pohnpei State, capital of the FSM (annual incidence of 1:1370 or3-5 times that in the West). Three patients came from the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI), and two came from American Samoa (AS). There were no reported consanguineous marriages, associated syndromes, or complications of surgery. CONCLUSION: HD was found to be up to 2-3 times more common among people from the FSM than has been reported in the developed world. Given the limitations of providing care and obtaining data from all the USAPls with a population that is spread over a massive expanse of ocean larger than the continental United States, this incidence is likely an underestimation of HD among Pacific Islanders. A secure web-based referral network developed in 1998 has been invaluable in collecting epidemiologic data from these islands as well as in providing health care workers in the USAPI with an efficient and inexpensive means to seek consultation from specialists and sub-specialists at a major tertiary care medical facility."
16920474,"Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) is a disorder in which initial left ventricular systolic dysfunction and symptoms of heart failure occur between the late stages of pregnancy and the early postpartum period. It is common in some countries and rare in others. The causes and pathogenesis are poorly understood. Molecular markers of an inflammatory process are found in most patients. Clinical presentation includes usual signs and symptoms of heart failure, and unusual presentations relating to thromboembolism. Clinicians should consider PPCM in any peripartum patient with unexplained disease. Conventional heart failure treatment includes use of diuretics, beta blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Effective treatment reduces mortality rates and increases the number of women who fully recover left ventricular systolic function. Outcomes for subsequent pregnancy after PPCM are better in women who have first fully recovered heart function. Areas for future research include immune system dysfunction, the role of viruses, non-conventional treatments such as immunosuppression, immunoadsorption, apheresis, antiviral treatment, suppression of proinflammatory cytokines, and strategies for control and prevention."
24938285,"Epidemiological studies of primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) are crucial for describing the burden to society and the public medical system and for shedding light on aetiology. Previous reports of the epidemiology of pSS show variable outcomes. We conducted a systematic review of the epidemiology of pSS to assess the prevalence rates (PRs) and incidence rates (IRs), and to investigate possible geographic variations in pSS.A systematic literature search of PubMed and Embase (updated to 22 October 2013) was performed to identify all published reports on the epidemiology of pSS. The incidence and prevalence rates of pSS were summarised with IRs or PRs and 95% CIs.The literature search yielded 1880 related citations. Only 21 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. According to a random-effects model, the pooled IR for pSS was 6.92 (95% CI 4.98 to 8.86) per 100 000 person-years. The overall PR was 60.82 (95% CI 43.69 to 77.94) cases per 100 000 inhabitants with a slightly lower estimate of Baodong Qin is BDQ, Jiaqi Wang is JQW, Zaixing Yang is ZXY, Renqian Zhong is RQZ. 43.03 (25.74 to 60.31) cases per 100 000 inhabitants when only considering population-based studies. The female/male ratio in incidence data was 9.15 (95% CI 3.35 to 13.18). The female/male ratio in prevalence data was 10.72 (95% CI 7.35 to 15.62). The overall age of pSS patients was 56.16 years (95% CI 52.54 to 59.78).Incidence and prevalence rates of pSS vary widely around the world. The results help us better understand the global epidemiology of pSS. Large population-based studies combining meticulous case-finding and case-ascertainment strategies are needed."
7551657,"There have been no previous attempts to estimate the incidence of juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) in the UK and Ireland. Consultant paediatricians from these countries were asked to report all cases of JDM which were diagnosed in 1992 and 1993 to the British Paediatric Surveillance Unit. One-hundred-and-twenty-one reports were received, of which 48 were confirmed cases of JDM and three were confirmed cases of polymyositis. The estimated incidence of JDM was 1.9 per million children aged under 16 yr (95% confidence interval 1.4-2.6). The median age at onset was 6.8 yr and the median delay in diagnosis was 4 months. Girls were affected much more often than boys (ratio 5.0:1). In the cases with an onset in 1992 there appeared to be a cluster of cases with an onset in April and May."
27139922,"Porphyrias are rare diseases caused by altered haem synthesis leading to the accumulation of different haem intermediates. Neurovisceral attacks may occur in acute porphyrias, while photosensitivity is the presenting symptom in cutaneous porphyrias. We present here an overview of symptoms and a flowchart for the diagnosis of cutaneous porphyrias, with recommendations for monitoring and an update of treatment options. From the Danish Porphyria Register, we present the incidences and approximate prevalences of cutaneous porphyrias within the last 25 years. A total of 650 patients with porphyria cutanea tarda were identified, 73 with erythropoietic protoporphyria, 9 with variegate porphyria, 4 with hereditary coproporphyria and one with congenital erythropoietic porphyria. The total incidence of all porphyrias was ~0.52/100,000 per year."
8349860,"BACKGROUND:Hereditary palmoplantar keratoderma (HPPK), type papulosa, is rare, and epidemiologic data are sporadic and inconsistent. An epidemiologic population study of this disease has not been performed previously. OBJECTIVE:We performed a large population study on prevalence of HPPK, type papulosa, in Croatia. METHODS:The data were collected from medical records of dermatology departments throughout Croatia; 14 patients and their relatives were examined. Histopathologic studies were performed in 11 of these 14 patients. RESULTS:Fifty-five patients were identified and the prevalence was 1.17 per 100,000 inhabitants. All 55 patients belonged to 20 different families. An autosomal dominant mode of inheritance was confirmed in 13 families. All 14 patients examined by the authors had both palmar and plantar lesions; the volar aspects of fingers were also involved. Thickened nails were observed in four patients, and no significant skin lesions were found elsewhere. CONCLUSION:HPPK, type papulosa, is rare, and its prevalence in Croatia is about four times lower than HPPK, Unna-Thost type. It should be considered a distinct entity."
11087787,"Epidemiologic data on inclusion body myositis (IBM) are scarce, and possibly biased, because they are derived from larger neuromuscular centers. The present nationwide collaborative cross-sectional study, which culminated on July 1, 1999, resulted in identification of 76 patients with IBM and the establishment of a prevalence of 4.9 patients with IBM per million inhabitants in the Netherlands. Several discrepancies suggest that this may be an underestimation. The most frequently identified pitfall in diagnosing IBM was an erroneous diagnosis of polymyositis or motor neuron disease."
19844117,"To evaluate the incidence, gender, symptoms and age at diagnosis among patients with classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency in Croatia.Data were collected retrospectively for all classical CAH patients born or electively aborted following prenatal diagnosis between 01.01.1995 and 31.12.2006 and were compared with the data of the previously conducted study evaluating CAH patients discovered between 1964 and 1984.During a 12-year period, 34 classical CAH patients were born. There were 20 salt-wasting (SW) (12 females/8 males) and 14 simple virilizing (SV) patients (7 females/7 males). If 3 female fetuses, electively aborted, were added, that would be a total of 37 CAH patients. With 532,942 live births and 34 CAH patients born over this period, incidence of classical CAH was estimated to 1:15,574 or 1:14,403 if 3 electively aborted fetuses were included. The lower incidence of SW boys compared to SW girls (8:12) and similar number of SW and SV boys (8:7) indicate that substantial proportion of SW boys die unrecognized. Owing to better health care, diagnosis was established significantly earlier in SW and SV girls compared to the period of 1964-1984 (p < 0.003). During 1995-2006, none of the patients died following the diagnosis of CAH, and there was no erroneous sex assignment.Despite of improvement in health care, diagnosis of CAH in Croatia is still delayed and some of the patients go unrecognized or die. Therefore, we think that the results of our study support the need for the introduction of newborn screening."
27159262,"To study the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of Takayasu arteritis (TAK) in southeast Norway (population 2.8 million).All study area hospital databases were screened to capture every potential TAK case between 1999 and 2012. These cases were manually chart reviewed, and only patients fulfilling either the 1990 American College of Rheumatology classification or the 1995 Ishikawa diagnostic criteria were included.Inclusion criteria were met by 78 patients (68 female, 10 male). Point prevalence (by 2012) segregated by ethnic origin was 22.0 per 106 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 17-29) in northern Europeans compared to 78.1 (95% CI 38-152) in Asian whites and 108.3 (95% CI 46-254) in Africans (P < 0.001). The incidence rate increased from 1 to 2 per 106 in the first to last 5-year period of the study (P = 0.03). Northern Europeans were mean age 32.3 years at onset, and 47% had involvement confined to aortic arch branches (angiographic type I), while 24% had extensive type V disease. Mean onset age in Asian and African cases was 20.3 years and 47% had type V disease. Coexisting inflammatory bowel disease was observed in 8% and ankylosing spondylitis in 7%.We report 2-4 times higher population prevalence than previously observed, and the highest prevalence ever found in Norwegians of Asian and African descent. The results support the idea that TAK in northern Europeans is marked by limited arterial involvement and older age at onset."
17825241,"Craniopharyngiomas are rare benign epithelial tumors, arising from the pituitary stalk or gland and developing in the sellar and suprasellar region, affecting both adults and children. Incidence is 0.5 to 2 new cases per million inhabitants. Clinical features essentially include visual disturbances, endocrine deficiencies, and neurological signs. Initial signs are often visual loss and increased intracranial pressure in children, growth and pubertal delay in teenagers, visual disturbances or cognitive impairment in adults. Diagnosis is made on MRI and CT scan, demonstrating a sellar or suprasellar tumor, heterogeneous, with frequent calcifications. Craniopharyngiomas can be classified depending on their locations from the sella, the diaphragma sellae, and upon their origins from the pituitary stalk or the infundibulum. They can also be classified depending on the location from the optic chiasm and the third ventricle. This classification allows surgical series comparison, which is of importance since developments and extensions of the tumor can explain surgical difficulties. The management of this lesion is still controversial. Because it is an extra-cerebral benign lesion, the ideal goal of treatment should be complete tumor removal with improvement of altered visual functions, minimal deterioration of endocrine function, and no neuropsychological impairment. But the situation of the tumor, its relationship with third ventricle, hypothalamus, optic tract, vascular structures make its removal often difficult. However, great progresses have been realized in surgical treatment, resulting in a dramatic improvement of the prognosis of craniopharyngiomas. Nowadays, one can expect total removal in 60 to 70% of patients, subtotal removal in 20 to 30%, and partial removal in 10%. When total removal is impossible, radiotherapy may reduce the risk of a poor evolution. Recurrences are a problem in 15% of patients with total removal, 35% in subtotal removal, 70% in partial removal. If radiotherapy has not been performed as first treatment, it is efficient in 80% of recurrences. Long term follow up is necessary in these patients, due to medical management of endocrine, visual and psychological problems, and risk of late recurrence. With close involvement in this management, most of patients may enjoy a good outcome, 80% being able to return to normal active life."
9409399,"From January 1978 to December 1995, 92 cases of Moyamoya disease were collected from seven major medical centers in Taiwan. The data gave an annual incidence rate of 0.048 per 100,000 population. There were 40 males and 52 females and the ages ranged from 2 to 62 years with the peak incidence in the 31-40 year age group (23 cases). Cerebral infarction occurred in 20 out of 24 juvenile patients (83%), and in 24 out of 68 adult patients (35%). The difference was statistically significant. Haemorrhagic stroke was more frequent in adult patients. Computed tomographic scans following stroke showed cerebral infarction in 44 cases, ventricular haemorrhage in 26 cases, intracerebral haemorrhage in 14 cases and pure subarachnoid haemorrhage in eight. The most frequent initial symptom was motor disturbance (59%), followed by headache (49%) and impaired consciousness (35%). This survey showed an incidence rate much lower than that in Japan, but comparable with those in other Oriental countries and higher than those in Western countries. The male-to-female ratio once differed considerably from that of the Japanese series, but from the present study is now quite similar."
24035773,"Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) has become a major cause of upper gastrointestinal morbidity in children and adults. However, there are few data on the nationwide prevalence of EoE. We aimed to estimate the prevalence of EoE in the United States.We collected health insurance claims from a large database that represented the U.S. commercially insured population. We analyzed data from 2008 to 2011, identifying cases of EoE by using a previously validated definition, and calculated a period prevalence by using data from 2009 to 2011. EoE was defined as any instance of the International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision code 530.13. We calculated the prevalence of the code in the database and standardized the estimate to the U.S. population.Of 35,575,388 individuals in this database, 16,405 had at least 1 code for EoE. The mean age was 33.5 years, 65% were male, 55.8% had dysphagia, and 52.8% had a diagnostic code for at least 1 allergic condition. Among 11,569,217 individuals with continuous insurance coverage between mid-2009 and mid-2011, 6513 had at least 1 code for EoE. When standardized to the U.S. population, the estimated period prevalence of EoE was 56.7/100,000 persons, translating to approximately 152,152 cases in the U.S. Prevalence peaked in men 35-39 years old, with a rate of 114.6/100,000 persons.Despite its relatively recent description, EoE is frequently diagnosed in the United States, with an estimated prevalence of 56.7/100,000 persons. This estimate depends on the accuracy of the International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision code, but it could be an underestimate, because knowledge of the code and recognition of EoE are increasing."
1685193,"This report is concerned with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1, 17q11.2) in south-western Ontario, an ethnically diverse population derived from multiple immigrations. The population incidence, prevalence, and mutation rates for this disease are similar in most racial groups of this population and are also comparable to earlier reports. NF-1 is one of the most common single gene disorders in this population. The occurrence of the disease is not affected by the birth order or sex of the transmitting parent. The severe manifestation of this disease is statistically related to paternal transmission. Five polymorphic DNA probes (pA1041, pHHH202, pTH1719, NF1, pEW206, pEW207) were evaluated in relation to segregation of NF-1 using appropriate restriction enzymes. The observed heterozygosity was found to be relatively high, ranging from 25% to 55% for all the probes on 17q and flanking the NF-1 gene. We recommend the use of pHHH202/pTH1719 and pEW206 in any linkage analysis for detection of the presence of the NF-1 mutation. For informative families the degree of certainty is as high as 99.5%. Some future modifications may include the use of NF-1 exon specific probes and primers that remain to be evaluated for heterogeneity and heterozygosity among populations."
542546,"Between 1949 and Nov. 30, 1977 a total of 123 cases of Wilson's disease have been registered in the GDR. Using the available statistics the incidence rate of the disease is assumed to be about 2.9/100,000, the gene frequency approx. 0.53 per cent and the heterozygote incidence 1.05 per cent, supposing that the Hardy-Weinberg law applies to a large extent. Conclusions are drawn from the available material with a view to detection of the disease infuture and to genetic family counselling."
19640226,"Chagas disease causes the highest burden of any parasitic disease in the Western hemisphere. By applying published seroprevalence figures to immigrant populations, we estimate that 300,167 individuals with Trypanosoma cruzi infection live in the United States, with 30,000-45,000 cardiomyopathy cases and 63-315 congenital infections annually. T. cruzi causes a substantial disease burden in the United States."
9858443,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence of juvenile chronic arthritis (JCA), familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), and Behçet's disease in Turkish children through a field survey. METHODS: The field survey was based on cluster centering with 2 level strata. A total of 46,813 children were screened. For the diagnosis of chronic arthritis and Behçet's previously suggested criteria were used. We have developed criteria for the diagnosis of probable FMF. Children previously diagnosed to have these diseases were also defined and included. RESULTS: JCA was found in 6.4/10,000. 2.8/10,000 children were previously diagnosed as FMF (minimum phenotype frequency). Together with the probable diagnosis of FMF, the prevalence increased to 9.3/10,000. The findings were also compared with those of our center. None of the 46,813 children had Behçet's disease. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of chronic arthritis is similar to the other childhood populations reported. However, FMF has a very high prevalence."
19398911,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The present review of Schnyder corneal dystrophy (SCD) corrects the misconceptions in the published literature about this disease. Understanding the clinical findings facilitates diagnosis of the dystrophy. RECENT FINDINGS: Retrospective case series of 115 affected individuals from 34 SCD families identified since 1989 reports the clinical findings in a large cohort and the long-term visual morbidity of SCD. The configuration of the progressive corneal clouding is predictable on the basis of age and, contrary to many older publications, only 54% of affected patients were found to have corneal crystals. Penetrating keratoplasty was reported in 20 of 37 (54%) patients of at least 50 years and 10 of 13 (77%) patients of at least 70 years. Best corrected visual acuity 1 year prior to penetrating keratoplasty in 15 eyes (nine patients) ranged from 20/25 to 20/400 including seven eyes with other ocular disorders. Best corrected visual acuity in the remaining eight eyes was 20/25 to 20/70. These patients often complained of glare preoperatively, which most likely resulted from light scattering from the corneal cholesterol. CONCLUSION: The literature on SCD must be changed to reflect new information about the disease. When present, corneal crystals facilitate disease diagnosis but the examiner must be aware that they are only present 54% of the time. Although scotopic vision remains good until old age, disproportionate loss of photopic vision with frequent complaints of glare necessitates penetrating keratoplasty in the majority of patients over 50 years of age."
22707337,"With the introduction of all-trans retinoic acid and arsenic trioxide, the management of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) has changed dramatically. We performed a population-based study of APL in the United States to determine its incidence and relative survival (RS) during a 34-year period.We identified 1397 patients diagnosed with APL between 1975 and 2008 in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. Patients were categorized into 4 age groups and 3 calendar periods. As a comparison, we also reviewed the outcome of APL patients treated at our institution during approximately the same time interval.The incidences of APL increased with time period and patient age. Short- and long-term RS improved with each calendar period, with the greatest improvement occurring between 1991 and 1999; 5-year RS rates were 0.18 for patients diagnosed in 1975-1990, 0.52 in 1991-1999, and 0.64 in 2000-2008. Age was an important predictor of survival. For example, the 5-year RS rate in patients diagnosed in 2000-2008 was 0.38 for patients aged ≥ 60 years and 0.73 and 0.75 for patients aged <20 years and 20-39 years, respectively. Similar treads of improvements in the survival were observed in APL patients treated at our institution.The incidence of APL has increased, especially in the last decade. Clinical outcome improved remarkably in patients with APL diagnosed from 1991 to 1999, mainly because of the increased use of all-trans retinoic acid."
11736938,"In this report we analyse the presenting features of a series of patients diagnosed with Waldenström macroglobulinaemia (WM) in Spain over the last 10 years. Criteria for diagnosis required a serum monoclonal IgM protein > or = 30 g/l and > 20% bone marrow lymphocytes. Two hundred and seventeen patients were included in the study, with a median age of 69 years and male/female ratio of 2:1. The most common symptoms at diagnosis were anaemia (38%), hyperviscosity (31%), B symptoms (23%), bleeding (23%) and neurological symptoms (22%). Sixty-one patients (27%) were asymptomatic at diagnosis and, to date, 32 of them have not received chemotherapy. Variables predicting a shorter survival free of therapy were haemoglobin < 12.5 g/dl and high beta2microglobulin (beta2M). The 83% of patients who did receive treatment were distributed as follows: chlorambucil/prednisone (43%), intermittent chlorambucil (11%), continuous chlorambucil (26%), cyclophosphamide/vincristine/prednisone (COP, 13.5%) and other (6.5%). Response to therapy was complete in 2%, partial in 48% and minor in 10%. Finally, 28% and 13% of patients presented stable and progressive disease, respectively, which was more common among patients treated with COP. Progression-free survival was 43% at 5 years, with three independent predictors for shorter progression-free survival (PFS): COP treatment, age > 65 and B symptoms at diagnosis. The 10-year projected overall survival (OS) was 55%. The two most frequent causes of death were development of second malignancies (31%), or infections (19%). The two main variables predicting a poor OS were hyperviscosity and high beta2M. In summary, this study favours the use of chlorambucil-based therapy as the standard treatment for WM, and describes a subset of patients who should be considered as suffering a smouldering form and who therefore do not require treatment for a long period of time."
21647999,"OBJECTIVES: To establish the prevalence and antenatal diagnosis of schizencephaly in the UK. METHODS: Data on schizencephaly were extracted from six regional congenital anomaly registers. RESULTS: Thirty-eight cases of schizencephaly were identified in 2 567 165 livebirths and stillbirths, giving a total prevalence of 1.48/100 000 births (95% CI, 1.01-1.95). Eighteen (47% (95% CI, 31-63%)) of the 38 cases were identified antenatally. No affected fetus had an abnormal karyotype identified. A high proportion of cases of schizencephaly occurred in younger mothers: 63% were aged 24 years or less, significantly higher (P < 0.0001) than the corresponding proportion (26%) of mothers in England and Wales. The majority of cases were not identified until after 22 weeks of pregnancy. Additional anomalies associated with vascular disruption sequences were found in eight cases which had septo-optic dysplasia or absent septum pellucidum, one of which also had gastroschisis. CONCLUSIONS: Schizencephaly occurs more frequently in the fetuses of younger mothers. It is often associated with septo-optic dysplasia, suggesting that the two conditions may share a common origin, arising as a result of destructive processes that cause changes in the brain which only become apparent on ultrasound in the second half of pregnancy."
3263224,"The prevalence of child neuromuscular disease in Southern Norway by January 1st, 1983, was studied by collecting data from all available sources. All children born 1. 1. 1965 or later were included in the study. The total group consisted of 110 patients from 17 different diagnostic categories. Total prevalence on this group was found to be 24.9 X 10(5). Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), with a prevalence of 10.89 X 10(5) constituted 29.2% of the total material. In the spinal muscle atrophy group (SMA), we found a significant increase in the number of boys affected, although an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance was found likely in all probands. Prevalence figures of child neuromuscular disease are hard to compare, as most studies deal with an adult population. The prevalences of common and well-known large categories of neuromuscular diseases in childhood are in agreement with previous studies. For less well known and mild diseases, our figures are low. This may be due in part to a later onset and in part to a health system not sensitive to parents' complaints."
19496964,"Neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM) is a rare monogenic form of diabetes which is diagnosed in the first 6 months of life. Several studies in the last few years provide information on genetic causes for NDM.The aim of this study was to identify all patients with diabetes in the first 6 months of life through the Austrian Diabetes Register, which is available since 1989. A retrospective data analyses was performed to calculate the current incidence of NDM.Ten patients were registered with diabetes onset within the first 6 months of life in the Austrian Diabetes Register. Evaluation of detailed clinical data was performed by sending a questionnaire to all diabetes centers.Ten patients from nine different families with NDM were diagnosed in Austria from 1989 until September 2007. Seven patients (one male, six females) had transient NDM (TNDM), three (two males, one female) showed a permanent course [permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus (PNDM)]. One had immunodeficiency, polyendocrinopathy and enteropathy X-linked (IPEX) syndrome and another showed aplasia of the pancreas; no genetic etiology was found in the third case. In three out of seven patients with a transient course of NDM a genetic diagnosis was possible. Two female siblings had activating point mutations in the ABCC8 gene, although one patient had paternal uniparental isodisomy of chromosome 6q24. One patient's family did not consent to genetic testing.The incidence of NDM in Austria is 1/160 949, with an incidence of 1/ 536 499 for PNDM and 1/229 928 for TNDM."
21842592,"In a muscle biopsy based study, only 9 out of 5450 biopsy samples, received from all parts of greater Istanbul area, had typical clinical and most suggestive light microscopic sporadic-inclusion body myositis (s-IBM) findings. Two other patients with and ten further patients without characteristic light microscopic findings had referring diagnosis of s-IBM. As the general and the age-adjusted populations of Istanbul in 2010 were 13.255.685 and 2.347.300 respectively, the calculated corresponding 'estimated prevalences' of most suggestive s-IBM in the Istanbul area were 0.679 X 10(-6) and 3.834 X 10(-6). Since Istanbul receives heavy migration from all regions of Turkey and ours is the only muscle pathology laboratory in Istanbul, projection of these figures to the Turkish population was considered to be reasonable and an estimate of the prevalence of s-IBM in Turkey was obtained. The calculated 'estimated prevalence' of s-IBM in Turkey is lower than the previously reported rates from other countries. The wide variation in the prevalence rates of s-IBM may reflect different genetic, immunogenetic or environmental factors in different populations."
7597405,"Cord blood screening for congenital toxoplasmosis was performed prospectively on 30,000 samples collected between 1986 and 1994 in the region of Basel, Switzerland, covering up to 95% of all births. Congenital infection was suspected in cases of serum with specific antitoxoplasma IgM or IgA or with a level of specific IgG above 300 IU/ml as measured by EIA from Sanofi-Pasteur. The percentage of cases to be screened declined from 2.5 to 1.2% and the cases of confirmed congenital toxoplasmosis from 0.073 to 0.033% during the observation period. This observation may be due to several reasons, such as improved primary prevention or more frequent diagnosis and treatment during pregnancy. In 178 cases of cord blood serology suspicious for acute toxoplasmosis, an enquiry with the gynecologist in charge of the pregnant woman was carried out. 126 mothers (71%) presented with a confirmed immunity against Toxoplasma gondii early in pregnancy and screening of the child was not needed. From 37 pregnancies (21%) no information was available. 15 out of 24 confirmed cases of toxoplasmosis of the mother during pregnancy were detected by cord blood analysis. In 17 of 24 cases of maternal toxoplasmosis treatment with spiramycin, pyrimethamine/sulfadoxine or both was performed. 10 of 17 newborns from mothers treated during pregnancy had elevated toxoplasma IgG titres at birth, but only one child was infected. 7 newborns had an inconspicuous toxoplasma serology at birth and were not infected. 7 cases of toxoplasmosis during pregnancy were detected by the check back and remained untreated; 4 out of 7 newborns had congenital toxoplasmosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
7809493,"Standard epidemiological and clinical features of sarcoidosis were evaluated in 24 regional centres from Moravia and Silesia (4 million inhabitants). During 1981-1990 the incidence ranged from 3.3 to 4.4/100,000 with slight decrease after 1985, when unselected chest X-ray screening was restricted. The prevalence (however disputable in sarcoidosis) increased from 41.3 to 63.1/100,000. Sex ratio male/female was 1: 2.35; only 39% of patients were younger than 40 years. Biopsy supported the diagnosis in 60% of cases. Tuberculin negativity was found in 64%. X-ray types were presented as follows: 0-2%, I-71%, II-22%, III-5%. Regional incidences varied from 0.9 to 11.7/100,000. Lower values were found in mining areas and high pneumoconiosis incidence. The course of the disease was benign with only sporadic extrapulmonary complications or pulmonary fibrosis. The results indicate that improved knowledge of sarcoidosis has brought epidemiological equilibrium to the evaluated area."
25876182,"BACKGROUND:The FYB gene encodes adhesion and degranulation-promoting adaptor protein (ADAP), a hematopoietic-specific protein involved in platelet activation, cell motility and proliferation, and integrin-mediated cell adhesion. No ADAP-related diseases have been described in humans, but ADAP-deficient mice have mild thrombocytopenia and increased rebleeding from tail wounds. PATIENTS AND METHODS:We studied a previously reported family of five children from two consanguineous sibships of Arab Christian descent affected with a novel autosomal recessive bleeding disorder with small-platelet thrombocytopenia. Homozygosity mapping and exome sequencing were used to identify the genetic lesion causing the disease phenotype on chromosome 5. Bone-marrow morphology and platelet function were analyzed. Platelets were characterized by scanning electron microscopy. RESULTS:We identified a homozygous deleterious nonsense mutation, c.393G>A, in FYB. A reduced percentage of mature megakaryocytes was found in the bone marrow. Patients' platelets showed increased basal expression of P-selectin and PAC-1, and reduced increments of activation markers after stimulation with ADP, as detected by flow cytometry; they also showed reduced pseudopodium formation and the presence of trapped platelets between the fibrin fibers after thrombin addition, as observed on scanning electron microscopy. CONCLUSIONS:This is the first report of a disease caused by an FYB defect in humans, manifested by remarkable small-platelet thrombocytopenia and a significant bleeding tendency. The described phenotype shows ADAP to be important for normal platelet production, morphologic changes, and function. It is suggested that mutation analysis of this gene be included in the diagnosis of inherited thrombocytopenia."
11349198,"OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to provide epidemiologic data on the prevalence of holoprosencephaly and to assess the sensitivity of routine ultrasonographic screening in a low-risk population. STUDY DESIGN: A population-based register of congenital abnormalities was used to identify reported cases of holoprosencephaly between 1985 and 1998. Sources included fetal losses, termination for fetal anomaly, stillbirths, and live births. Prenatal diagnoses and pregnancy outcomes were determined. RESULTS: Sixty-eight cases of holoprosencephaly were found among 531,686 births. The total prevalence (including pregnancy terminations) was 1.2 cases/10,000 registered births, and the birth prevalence (affected live births and stillbirths at >24 weeks' gestation) was 0.49 cases/10,000 births. Prenatal diagnosis was achieved in 71% of cases, rising to 86% during the second half of the study period; the mean gestational age at diagnosis was 19.8 weeks' gestation. Chromosomal abnormalities (75% of which were trisomy 13) were present in 38% of cases in which a karyotype was established. All those with aneuploidy (80% diagnosed prenatally) had other nonfacial anomalies; additional anomalies were also common in the euploid group (61% diagnosed prenatally), with 90% having facial abnormalities and 70% having other abnormalities. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of holoprosencephaly in second-trimester pregnancies was about 1 in 8000. Prenatal detection reached 86% with a routine anomaly scanning program. The etiology could usually be determined, which has important implications for recurrence risks."
22166308,"Medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD) is a rare, life-threatening condition. Early diagnosis by screening asymptomatic newborns may improve outcome, but the benefit to newborns identified with variants not encountered clinically is uncertain.To estimate, overall and by ethnic group: screen-positive prevalence and predictive value (PPV); MCADD prevalence; proportion MCADD variants detected of predicted definite or uncertain clinical importance.All births in areas of high ethnic minority prevalence in England.Prospective multicentre pilot screening service; testing at age five to eight days; standardized screening, diagnostic and management protocols; independent expert review of screen-positive cases to assign MCADD diagnosis and predicted clinical importance (definite or uncertain).Approximately 1.5 million babies (79% white; 10% Asian) were screened. MCADD was confirmed in 147 of 190 babies with a positive screening result (screen-positive prevalence: 1.20 per 10,000; MCADD prevalence: 0.94 per 10,000; PPV 77% [95% CI 71-83]), comprising 103 (70%) with MCADD variants of definite clinical importance (95 white [95%]; 2 Asian [2%]) and 44 (30%) with variants of uncertain clinical importance (29 white [67%]; 12 Asian [28%]).One baby in every 10,000 born in England is diagnosed with MCADD by newborn screening; around 60 babies each year. While the majority of MCADD variants detected are predicted to be of definite clinical importance, this varies according to ethnic group, with variants of uncertain importance most commonly found in Asian babies. These findings provide support for MCADD screening but highlight the need to take account of the ethnic diversity of the population tested at implementation."
15053381,"Expanded newborn screening (NBS) is aimed for early detection and intervention of treatable inborn errors of metabolism and also to establish incidence of these disorders in this part of the globe. The first expanded NBS programme initiated in the capital city of Andhra Pradesh to screen all the newborns born in four major Government Maternity Hospitals in Hyderabad by heel prick capillary blood collected on S&S 903 filter paper. Chromatographic (TLC and HPLC), electrophoretic (cellulose acetate and agarose) and ELISA based assays have been employed for screening of common inborn errors of metabolism. This study has shown a high prevalence of treatable Inborn errors of metabolism. Congenital hypothyroidsm is the most common disorder (1 in 1700) followed by congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (1 in 2575) and Hyperhomocystenemia (1 in 100). Interestingly, a very high prevalence of inborn errors of metabolism to the extent of 1 in every thousand newborns was observed. The study reveals the importance of screening in India, necessitating nation wide large-scale screening."
23428090,"Diagnosed cases of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) and Lyme disease (LD) have been reportable infectious diseases in Hungary since 1977 and 1998, respectively. Clinically diagnosed cases have been registered in the National Database of Epidemiological Surveillance System (NDESS). All reported TBE cases are confirmed by laboratory serological and, if necessary, PCR tests, whereas the registered cases of LD are mainly based on the appearance of erythema migrans concurring with possible exposure of tick bite. Our work is the first comparative epidemiological and geographical information analysis of these 2 diseases together. The following demographic data from each individual case (703 TBE and 13,606 LD) recorded in the NDESS were used: Sex, age, the starting date and place of the onset of disease, and a short report from the affected person. The descriptive epidemiological analysis of incidence was carried out using directly standardized rates, and smoothed indirectly standardized incidence ratios were calculated by hierarchical Bayesian methods at the municipality level using a Rapid Inquiry Facility (RIF). The average yearly incidence rate of TBE was 0.64 per 100,000 inhabitants (range, 0.46-0.84) and of LD was 12.37 per 100,000 inhabitants (range, 9.9-18.1), with the highest incidence rates in 1998 for TBE and 2008 for LD. The most affected age groups were men between 15 and 59 years of age for TBE, and women between 45 and 64 years of age for LD. Seasonality, based on the starting date of the illness, was also characterized. Extended areas of high risk were identified in western and northern Hungary, illustrated on high-resolution (municipality level) maps. On the basis of our analysis, it is possible to associate areas and periods of high-risk with characteristics (sex, age, residence) of groups most affected by tick-borne diseases in Hungary."
22005589,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the occurrence of arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC) in Europe and to identify possible risk factors. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective population-based epidemiological study using EUROCAT congenital anomaly registries. The study population included all cases of AMC (based on WHO ICD-9 or ICD-10 codes) that were livebirths (LB), fetal deaths (FD) from 20 weeks gestation and underwent termination of pregnancy for fetal anomaly (TOPFA), 1980-2006. RESULTS: Among 8.9 million births covered by 24 EUROCAT congenital anomaly registries, 757 AMC cases were reported. This gives a prevalence of 8.5 per 100,000. Five hundred and four (67%) AMC cases were LB, 199 (26%) cases were TOPFA, and FD occurred in 54 (7%) cases. First week survival status was known for 381 of the 504 LB (76%), of whom 87 (23%) died within the first week of life. Perinatal mortality associated with AMC was 32%. Two hundred and eighty-two (37%) cases had isolated AMC, 90 (12%) had additional syndrome or chromosomal anomalies and 385 (51%) had other major malformations. The same or similar anomaly was reported in 13% of siblings and in 12% of the mother's own family background. Information on prenatal testing was available for 521 cases of which 360 tested positive for a congenital anomaly, representing a sensitivity of 69%. Information on maternal illness before and during pregnancy and medication use in the first trimester was available for approximately a third of the mothers, of whom the vast majority reported no maternal illness or medication use. CONCLUSION: AMC is a rare occurrence, with a reported prevalence of 1:12,000. In this study, while information on potential risk factors such as maternal disease or maternal use of drugs was limited, they did not appear to be associated with the occurrence of AMC. AMC was lethal in a third of cases, either in utero or during the first week of life, although this may not be solely attributed to AMC as most cases had additional malformations."
12207152,"An epidemiological survey of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) was conducted in Molise, a central-southern region of Italy, from March 1998 to June 2000. Fifty-eight cases of CMT in 13 unrelated families were identified within the selected area. The prevalence of all subtypes of CMT was 17.5/100,000. All families underwent a bio-molecular analysis to disclose the duplication at gene locus 17p11.2 in order to ascertain the diagnosis of CMT type 1A. Our data revealed that 64% of all the observed patients had CMT1A, thus confirming the high prevalence of duplication of the 17p11.2 locus."
30073460,"Idiopathic Inflammatory myopathies (IIM) are rare disorders. The aim of our study was to determine the incidence of IIM in a well-defined Slovenian region. This retrospective study was conducted at the Department of Rheumatology, University Medical Centre Ljubljana, the only secondary/tertiary rheumatology center in a region with a population of 704,342 adults. We identified potential IIM cases by searching the electronic patient records for ICD-10 codes M33, M35.1, M35.8, M60, G72, G73, and J84. We included incipient IIM cases between January 2010 and December 2017, who were at the time of the diagnosis, residents of the inspected region. To avoid under-reporting due to miscoded cases, we obtained a list of the patients who had histological patterns consistent with IIM on muscle biopsy from the Institute of Pathology. The annual incidence rate for IIM was calculated. During the eight-year observation period, we identified 65 IIM cases (72.3% female, median (IQR) patient age 64.8 (54.8-73.2) years). The estimated annual incidence of IIM in the studied population was 11.5 (95% CI 9.0-14.6) per 106 adults, in females 16.2 (95% CI 12.1-21.4), and in males 6.6 (95% CI 4.0-10.2) per 106 adults. The incidence rate of IIM in Slovenia is consistent with data from the literature."
22974376,"OBJECTIVES: To estimate, by neonatal screening, the birth prevalence of congenital toxoplasmosis among live-born infants in Sergipe state, Brazil, and to investigate the clinical features of affected infants. METHODS: Dried blood spot specimens obtained from 15 204 neonates were assayed for the presence of anti-T. gondii IgM antibodies. Duplicate retesting was done in infants with positive and borderline results. Confirmatory testing in peripheral blood samples consisted of testing for anti-T. gondii IgG and IgM in infants and mothers. Those with possible congenital toxoplasmosis were evaluated and followed up to a median age of 20 months. Congenital infection was confirmed in the presence of persisting anti-T. gondii IgG antibodies beyond 12 months of age. All infants with confirmed infection were treated with pyrimethamine, sulfadiazine and folinic acid for 1 year. RESULTS:   Fifty-three infants had detectable IgM in dried blood spot specimens. Confirmatory testing was reactive in 39/50, of which, 38 completed follow-up. Six of 15 204 newborns were diagnosed with congenital toxoplasmosis, resulting in an estimated birth prevalence of four per 10 000 [CI 95% 1.4-8.0]. Four infants (67%) showed signs of congenital toxoplasmosis in their first year of life; three (75%) had retinochoroidal scars, and one had cerebral calcifications. Two infants remained asymptomatic until 20 months of age. CONCLUSIONS: The birth prevalence of congenital toxoplasmosis is high in the Brazilian state of Sergipe, with most of the infants showing ocular lesions. Preventive measures are strongly warranted."
16858850,"OBJECTIVES: Neural tube defects (NTDs), (including anencephaly, meningomyelocele and encephalocele), are among the most common birth defects, with high associated mortality and morbidity. NTDs occur in 1-5 per 1,000 births, with marked geographic and ethnic variations. However, there are few data concerning the incidence, associated anomalies, treatment and outcome of NTDs in Thailand. The objective of this study is to analyze data on NTD cases from 1990-1999 at Siriraj Hospital, a hospital with 18,000-20,000 deliveries annually. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A retrospective chart review of patients with NTDs who were born at or referred to Siriraj Hospital 1990-1999 was performed. RESULTS: During the 10 year period we examined, there were 115 patients with NTDs treated in the Department of Pediatrics as well as in other Departments at Siriraj Hospital. The incidence of NTD is 0.67 per 1,000 births. The sex distribution was equal among NTD cases, 55 (48%) females, 59 (51%) males and one (1%) unidentified sex. Isolated NTDs accounted for 105 (91%) cases, and 10 (8.7%) had at least 1 other structural anomaly such as cleft lip/palate, imperforate anus, amniotic band sequence, or ambiguous genitalia. Among all NTD cases, there were 55 (48%) with myelomeningocele, 45 (39%) with anencephaly, and 14 (12%) with encephalocele. Seventeen (15%) cases died; among these, 7 (41% of deaths) died in utero, 8 (47% of deaths) died in the early neonatal period, and 2 (12%) died after 1 year of age. Regarding treatment, 95 surgical corrections, 47 excisions and repairs, 45 excisions and VP shunts, 1 laminectomy and 2 club feet corrections were performed. CONCLUSIONS: In this hospital-based study of 115 patients with NTD, we found an incidence of 0.67/1000 births; however, as this was a hospital-based study, the community incidence is likely higher. Most cases were isolated NTDs, and almost half of NTDs were meningomyelocele. There was a high rate of mortality. Further studies are warranted to better elucidate the health burden from NTDs in Thailand. Public health interventions aimed at increasing the periconceptional consumption of folic acid should be implemented or enhanced to reduce the incidence of NTDs in Thailand."
8579217,"Nineteen cases of the Prader-Willi syndrome were collected in the San-in district, in the western part of Japan, and an epidemiological study was carried out. The male to female ratio was 1:1.11. Deletion of chromosome 15q11-13 was found in seven of 16 patients examined by means of high-resolution chromosome banding. The incidence among live-births was estimated to be 6.64 x 10(-5) (1 in 15,060 live-births) in 1980-1989, and the mutation rate was 3.32 x 10(-5) per gene per generation, as determined by a direct method. The prevalence was estimated to be 5.72 x 10(-5) (1 in 17,483) in patients under 15 years old, which was higher than that in other autosomal dominant diseases (tuberous sclerosis and congenital myotonic dystrophy) also studied in the San-in district. A birth-order effect was revealed and a slightly significant difference was found as to the fathers' age between the patients and their normal siblings. The results of these two tests are in accord with the recent discovery that this syndrome is caused by paternal chromosomal aberrations."
21443929,"MELAS (mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes) (OMIM 540000) is the most dominant subtype of mitochondrial myopathy. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence, natural course, and severity of MELAS.A prospective cohort study of 96 Japanese patients with MELAS was followed between June 2003 and April 2008. Patients with MELAS were identified and enrolled based on questionnaires administered to neurologists in Japan. MELAS was defined using the Japanese diagnostic criteria for MELAS. Two follow-up questionnaires were administered to neurologists managing MELAS patients at an interval of 5years.A prevalence of at least 0.58 (95% confidential interval (CI), 0.54-0.62)/100,000 was calculated for mitochondrial myopathy, whereas the prevalence of MELAS was 0.18 (95%CI, 0.02-0.34)/100,000 in the total population. MELAS patients were divided into two sub-groups: juvenile form and adult form. Stroke-like episodes, seizure and headache were the most frequent symptoms seen in both forms of MELAS. Short stature was significantly more frequent in the juvenile form, whereas hearing loss, cortical blindness and diabetes mellitus were significantly more frequent in the adult form. According to the Japanese mitochondrial disease rating scale, MELAS patients showed rapidly increasing scores (mean±standard deviation, 12.8±8.7) within 5years from onset of the disease. According to a Kaplan-Meier analysis, the juvenile form was associated with a higher risk of death than the adult form (hazard ratio, 3.29; 95%CI, 1.32-8.20; p=0.0105).We confirmed that MELAS shows a rapid degenerative progression within a 5-year interval and that this occurs in both the juvenile and the adult forms of MELAS and follows different natural courses.

19438933,"Hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSP) constitute a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by slowly progressive spasticity of the lower extremities. We performed the first clinical, epidemiological and genetic study of HSP in Southern Tunisia. We investigated 88 patients belonging to 38 unrelated Tunisian HSP families. We could establish the minimal prevalence of HSP in the district of Sfax at 5.75/100,000. Thirty-one percent of the families had a pure HSP, whereas 69% had a complicated form. The mode of inheritance was almost exclusively compatible with an autosomal recessive trait (97%, 37/38). Taking into account previously published results and new data generated in this work, genetic studies revealed significant or putative linkage to known HSP loci in 13 families (34.2%) to either SPG11 (7/38, 18.4%), SPG15 (4/38, 10.5%) or to SPG4 and SPG5 in one family each. The linkage results could be validated through the identification of two recurrent truncating mutations (R2034X and M245VfsX246) in the SPG11 gene, three different mutations (Q493X, F683LfsX685 and the novel S2004T/r.?) in the SPG15 gene, the recurrent R499C mutation in the SPG4 gene as well as the new R112X mutation in the SPG5 gene. SPG11 and SPG15 are the major responsible HSP genes in Tunisia."
22930352,"A Danish-Swedish collaboration was established to identify and classify a Danish cohort of patients with epidermolytic ichthyosis, also known as epidermolytic hyperkeratosis. Patients were recruited from 5 dermatology departments in Denmark, and data were obtained using a structured questionnaire and a systematic examination together with photographs, histopathological descriptions and blood samples for mutational analysis. Sixteen patients from 12 families with generalized or naevoid epidermolytic ichthyosis and ichthyosis bullosa of Siemens were identified. Five families had mutations in K1 and 6 families had mutations in K10. Nine patients had been treated with systemic retinoids (etretinate, acitretin, isotretinoin or alitretinoin), but only 3 patients had acceptable treatment responses and chose to continue therapy. In conclusion epidermolytic ichthyosis is a rare disease with a prevalence of approximately 1 in 350,000 in Denmark and a high percentage of de novo mutations (75%). We identified 4 novel disease-causing mutations."
1822774,"A survey of the world literature, involving over 150 reported studies, of the population frequencies of various inherited neuromuscular diseases has been carried out. Data are presented for the commoner forms of muscular dystrophy (Duchenne, Becker, facioscapulohumeral, limb girdle), myotonic dystrophy and congenital myotonias, proximal spinal muscular atrophies, and the hereditary motor and sensory neuropathies. A conservative estimate of the overall prevalence among both sexes is around 286 x 10(-6), that is 1 in 3500 of the population may be expected to have a disabling inherited neuromuscular disease presenting in childhood or in later life. If severe disorders manifest only in infancy and early childhood (e.g. Werdnig-Hoffmann disease and severe congenital muscular dystrophy) and the rare forms of dystrophy and myopathy are also included, then the overall prevalence could well exceed 1 in 3000."
25480460,"BACKGROUND: Congenital chylothorax (CCT) is a rare disease of unknown aetiology. Treatment approaches vary; none has been evaluated prospectively. OBJECTIVE: To prospectively determine incidence, treatment and outcome of infants with CCT born in Germany in 2012. DESIGN: CCT was defined as non-traumatic chylous pleural effusion within 28 days after birth. As part of the Surveillance Unit for Rare Pediatric Conditions in Germany (Erhebungseinheit für seltene pädiatrische Erkrankungen in Deutschland), all paediatric departments (n=432) received monthly reporting cards to notify the study centre of CCT cases, which were analysed based on anonymised questionnaires and discharge summaries. Data are shown as median (range) or n/N. RESULTS: Of 37 cases reported, 28 met inclusion criteria. Questionnaires and/or discharge summaries were available for 27/28. Assuming complete reporting, the incidence of CCT was 1:24 000. Nine infants suffered from proven or suspected syndromal anomalies, most frequently Noonan syndrome (5/9). Postnatally, 23 required mechanical ventilation, 3 continuous positive airway pressure; only 1 had no respiratory support. 17 infants were treated with inotropes/vasopressors, 25 required pleural drainage for 11 (1-36) days. In 13 infants, enteral feeds were withheld initially; 25 received medium-chain triglyceride diet at some time, 9 were treated with octreotide or somatostatin. 18 infants survived without, 6 with sequelae attributable to the underlying disorder; 3 infants died (median age at death 37 (2-144) days). Duration of hospital stay in survivors was 51 (20-127) days. Infants treated with octreotide or somatostatin had similar outcomes compared with those not treated. CONCLUSIONS: Based on this small observational study, CCT seems to have a favourable prognosis if not associated with genetic disorders."
6576612,"The prevalence of hereditary motor and sensory neuropathies (HMSN) and their distribution according to the severity of the disability were studied in a population-based series of Swedish children 2-15 years old. The prevalence per 100 000 of total peroneal muscle atrophies was 21.6 and of all clinical HMSN 19.0 Among HMSN, de- and remyelinating types (HMSN I) constituted 8 per 100000 and neuronal-axonal types (HMSN II) 11. Eighteen of the 21 HMSN I cases and 26 of the 29 HMSN II were considered to represent an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. Ten per cent of all children were severely, 70% moderately and 20% mildly disabled. All the severely affected children belonged to the HMSN I group and 9 of the 10 mildly affected to HMSN II."
25241232,"Listeriosis, caused by Listeria monocytogenes, is an important foodborne disease that can be difficult to control and commonly results in severe clinical outcomes. We aimed to provide the first estimates of global numbers of illnesses, deaths, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) due to listeriosis, by synthesising information and knowledge through a systematic review.We retrieved data on listeriosis through a systematic review of peer-reviewed and grey literature (published in 1990-2012). We excluded incidence data from before 1990 from the analysis. We reviewed national surveillance data where available. We did a multilevel meta-analysis to impute missing country-specific listeriosis incidence rates. We used a meta-regression to calculate the proportions of health states, and a Monte Carlo simulation to generate DALYs by WHO subregion.We screened 11,722 references and identified 87 eligible studies containing listeriosis data for inclusion in the meta-analyses. We estimated that, in 2010, listeriosis resulted in 23,150 illnesses (95% credible interval 6061-91,247), 5463 deaths (1401-21,497), and 172,823 DALYs (44,079-676,465). The proportion of perinatal cases was 20·7% (SD 1·7).Our quantification of the global burden of listeriosis will enable international prioritisation exercises. The number of DALYs due to listeriosis was lower than those due to congenital toxoplasmosis but accords with those due to echinococcosis. Urgent efforts are needed to fill the missing data in developing countries. We were unable to identify incidence data for the AFRO, EMRO, and SEARO WHO regions.WHO Foodborne Diseases Epidemiology Reference Group and the Université catholique de Louvain."

To adjust cut-off levels for 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) in relation to gestational age and birth weight, comparing the benefits in terms of reduction of recall rates with the two approaches and ultimately choosing the better of the two. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Since September 2001, blood samples from neonates born in North-Eastern Italy have been screened with a fluoroimmunoassay method for 17-OHP determination (DELFIA). A preliminary cut-off level of > or = 30 nmol/l was set both for term and preterm newborns. The values of 17-OHP were analysed using statistical methods in relation to gestational age and birth weight in order to modify the cut-off on the basis of our data. RESULTS: After 33 months of screening we screened 128,282 newborns and detected 6 affected babies. During the first 8 months of screening among the recalled babies, 89.6 and 78.1% were preterm and low-birth-weight newborns, respectively, with a recall rate of 2.59% for premature neonates and of 4.94% for babies with birth weights < 2,500 g. We chose a new cut-off value of 50 nmol/l for preterm newborns only and, after 4 months, the recall rate was reduced to 0.83% for these infants and to 1.83% for low-birth-weight infants. CONCLUSION: After 33 months of screening for CAH in North-Eastern Italy, we report an incidence of 1:21,380. In 5 out of 6 affected babies, the diagnosis was established only after a positive screening test, which prevented a severe salt-wasting crisis in these babies. The cut-off level related to gestational age led to a significant reduction in the number of false-positives among preterm babies.We therefore intend to continue with the screening program for CAH in North-Eastern Italy, keeping a gestational-age-related cut-off in the hope that our data may encourage a national screening program for CAH."
7986716,"We studied the incidence of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) in a population served by one district general hospital over a 10-year period (1981-90). Cases were sought through investigation of individuals presenting with suggestive peripheral blood findings. 279 new cases were diagnosed in a population rising from 203,000 to 226,000 over the study period. The observed incidence rate did not change over the study period. The crude incidence rate was 12.6/100,000/year. Age-specific incidence rates per 100,000 per year were 0.5 for age < 50, 5.3 for age 50-59, 15 for age 60-69, 49 for age 70-79, and 89 for age 80+. A cohort study of one large general practice revealed several previously unknown and asymptomatic cases, indicating that the observed figures for the population overall may still underestimate the real incidence. We conclude that MDS is more common than reported in previous studies and that incidence continues to rise into very old age. Difficulties in case ascertainment hamper reliable estimates of true incidence."
19267933,"Jacobsen syndrome is a MCA/MR contiguous gene syndrome caused by partial deletion of the long arm of chromosome 11. To date, over 200 cases have been reported. The prevalence has been estimated at 1/100,000 births, with a female/male ratio 2:1. The most common clinical features include pre- and postnatal physical growth retardation, psychomotor retardation, and characteristic facial dysmorphism (skull deformities, hypertelorism, ptosis, coloboma, downslanting palpebral fissures, epicanthal folds, broad nasal bridge, short nose, v-shaped mouth, small ears, low set posteriorly rotated ears). Abnormal platelet function, thrombocytopenia or pancytopenia are usually present at birth. Patients commonly have malformations of the heart, kidney, gastrointestinal tract, genitalia, central nervous system and skeleton. Ocular, hearing, immunological and hormonal problems may be also present. The deletion size ranges from approximately 7 to 20 Mb, with the proximal breakpoint within or telomeric to subband 11q23.3 and the deletion extending usually to the telomere. The deletion is de novo in 85% of reported cases, and in 15% of cases it results from an unbalanced segregation of a familial balanced translocation or from other chromosome rearrangements. In a minority of cases the breakpoint is at the FRA11B fragile site. Diagnosis is based on clinical findings (intellectual deficit, facial dysmorphic features and thrombocytopenia) and confirmed by cytogenetics analysis. Differential diagnoses include Turner and Noonan syndromes, and acquired thrombocytopenia due to sepsis. Prenatal diagnosis of 11q deletion is possible by amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling and cytogenetic analysis. Management is multi-disciplinary and requires evaluation by general pediatrician, pediatric cardiologist, neurologist, ophthalmologist. Auditory tests, blood tests, endocrine and immunological assessment and follow-up should be offered to all patients. Cardiac malformations can be very severe and require heart surgery in the neonatal period. Newborns with Jacobsen syndrome may have difficulties in feeding and tube feeding may be necessary. Special attention should be devoted due to hematological problems. About 20% of children die during the first two years of life, most commonly related to complications from congenital heart disease, and less commonly from bleeding. For patients who survive the neonatal period and infancy, the life expectancy remains unknown."
19887839,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in the TSC1 and TSC2 genes. Previous studies have estimated the prevalence of TSC to be 1:8,000 to 1:30,000. The numbers of patients and the populations accessed in these studies are relatively small. The aim of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of TSC in Taiwan with a population of 23 million people. METHODS: 95% of Taiwanese are enrolled in a single national health insurance database. This study uses this database to estimate the prevalence of TSC in a large Chinese population. RESULTS: The prevalence of TSC in Taiwan is estimated at 1:95,136. There is no prevalence difference in rural or urban areas. The ages of the patients ranges from 3 months to 75 years, with a mean of 14 +/- 11 years. Prevalence by age is 1:14,608, 1:18,851, and 1:24,617 for ages <6, 12, and 18 years, respectively. Only 15% of patients disclose a family history of TSC. The majority of cases (71.2%) are diagnosed in an outpatient visit by a pediatrician. CONCLUSION: The low prevalence of TSC in Taiwan might result from differences in penetrance, family planning, ethnic groups, and disease-modifying genes."

10636071,"BACKGROUND:The Swedish Polyposis Registry was set up in Sweden in the late 1950s to promote screening of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). The aim of this study was to examine the epidemiology of FAP in Sweden, including the influence of screening on morbidity and mortality in colorectal cancer (CRC). METHODS:Four hundred and thirty-one patients (213 males and 218 females) with FAP from 145 families recorded by the Swedish Polyposis Registry were investigated. The effect of screening on morbidity and mortality in CRC was evaluated by comparing the 216 probands with the 215 call-up patients. Three different periods were studied: the pre-screening period (1912-1956), the first screening period (1957-1976), and the second screening period (1977-1996). RESULTS:The mean annual incidence rates during the three periods were 0.2, 1.38, and 0.86 per million, respectively. The birth frequency was calculated to be 1 in 18,000 between 1947 and 1966, and the prevalence was 32 per million at the end of 1996. The proportion of new mutants among the FAP patients born between 1927 and 1966 was estimated to be 11%. The median age at diagnosis of probands was 39 (range, 11-71) years and did not change over time, although an increase was seen in the subgroup with CRC at diagnosis (P = 0.02). In the call-up group the median age at diagnosis was 22 (range, 3-65) years. Sixty-seven per cent of the probands and 3.3% of the call-up patients had CRC at diagnosis, and the corresponding mortality figures were 44% and 1.9%. The risk among probands of having CRC at diagnosis decreased from 81% to 49% (P = 0.0006). Female probands were diagnosed with symptoms (P = 0.03) and CRC (P = 0.04) earlier than male probands. CONCLUSIONS:A nationwide screening program facilitates detection and early diagnosis of FAP. A decrease in CRC morbidity among probands contributed to the improved prognosis. An earlier onset of symptoms and CRC in females indicate that the course of FAP is influenced by sex."
11932471,"BACKGROUND: Neuroblastoma is the second most common type of childhood tumor. It is not known whether screening for neuroblastoma at one year of age reduces the incidence of metastatic disease or mortality due to neuroblastoma. METHODS: We offered urine screening for neuroblastoma at approximately one year of age to 2,581,188 children in 6 of 16 German states from 1995 to 2000. A total of 2,117,600 eligible children in the remaining states served as controls. We compared the two groups in terms of the incidence of disseminated disease and mortality from neuroblastoma. RESULTS: A total of 1,475,773 children (61.2 percent of those who were born between July 1, 1994, and October 31, 1999) underwent screening. In this group, neuroblastoma was detected by screening in 149 children, of whom 3 have died. Fifty-five children who had negative screening tests were subsequently given a diagnosis of neuroblastoma; 14 of these children have died. The screened group and children in the control area had a similar incidence of stage 4 neuroblastoma (3.7 cases per 100,000 screened children [95 percent confidence interval, 2.7 to 4.7] and 3.8 per 100,000 controls [95 percent confidence interval, 2.9 to 4.6]) and a similar rate of death among children with neuroblastoma (1.3 deaths per 100,000 screened children [95 percent confidence interval, 0.7 to 1.8] and 1.2 per 100,000 controls [95 percent confidence interval, 0.7 to 1.7]). Comparison of the screened group and the children in the control area revealed substantial overdiagnosis in the former group (an estimated rate of 7 cases per 100,000 children [95 percent confidence interval, 4.6 to 9.2]); the overdiagnosis rate represents children who had neuroblastoma that was diagnosed by screening but who would not benefit from earlier diagnosis and treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings do not support the usefulness of general screening for neuroblastoma at one year of age."
8649538,"Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) is a diverse group of inherited disorders characterized by progressive lower-extremity spasticity and weakness. Insight into the genetic basis of these disorders is expanding rapidly. Uncomplicated autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, and X-linked HSP are genetically heterogeneous: different genes cause clinically indistinguishable disorders. A locus for autosomal recessive HSP is on chromosome 8q. Loci for autosomal dominant HSP have been identified on chromosomes 2p, 14q, and 15q. One locus (Xq22) has been identified for X-linked, uncomplicated HSP and shown to be due to a proteolipoprotein gene mutation in one family. The existence of HSP families for whom these loci are excluded indicates the existence of additional, as yet unidentified HSP loci. There is marked clinical similarity among HSP families linked to each of these loci, suggesting that gene products from HSP loci may participate in a common biochemical cascade, which, if disturbed, results in axonal degeneration that is maximal at the ends of the longest CNS axons. Identifying the single gene defects that cause HSPs distal axonopathy may provide insight into factors responsible for development and maintenance of axonal integrity. We review clinical, genetic, and pathologic features of HSP and present differential diagnosis and diagnostic criteria of this important group of disorders. We discuss polymorphic microsatellite markers useful for genetic linkage analysis and genetic counseling in HSP."
21656661,"There are few published studies on microtia-anotia frequency.Using data from birth defects surveillance programs around the world, we conducted a systematic review on the frequency of microtia-anotia to further explore the differences in prevalence across countries. Ninety-two birth defects surveillance programs were evaluated with a total of 8917 cases of microtia-anotia. We computed the prevalence per 10,000 births for each surveillance program for total cases of microtia-anotia (microtia types I to IV), microtia (types I to III), and anotia (type IV). Prevalence ratios were calculated by large geographic areas, race/ethnicity, and by surveillance methodologies.The overall prevalences were: microtia-anotia, 2.06 (confidence interval [CI], 2.02-2.10); microtia, 1.55 (CI, 1.50-1.60); and anotia 0.36 (CI, 0.34-0.38). Higher prevalences were observed for the Americas, Northern Europe and Asia, among Hispanics and Asians, and among active ascertainment and hospital-based surveillance programs.We observed marked variation in the prevalence of microtia-anotia across surveillance programs and within countries. These results must be interpreted cautiously as this variability may be explained mainly by differences in surveillance methods. However, given the magnitude of some of the differences, other factors may also be involved. This study contributes to the knowledge of the prevalence of microtia-anotia by providing a critical analysis of the existing data. In addition, it supports the need for a coding system that allows complete phenotype characterization of microtia-anotia, including severity and laterality, as well as for further studies on the variation of its frequency related to race and ethnicity."
20507631,"Inherited epidermolysis bullosa (EB) encompasses a number of disorders characterized by recurrent blister formation as the result of structural fragility within the skin and selected other tissues. All types and subtypes of EB are rare; the overall incidence and prevalence of the disease within the United States is approximately 19 per one million live births and 8 per one million population, respectively. Clinical manifestations range widely, from localized blistering of the hands and feet to generalized blistering of the skin and oral cavity, and injury to many internal organs. Each EB subtype is known to arise from mutations within the genes encoding for several different proteins, each of which is intimately involved in the maintenance of keratinocyte structural stability or adhesion of the keratinocyte to the underlying dermis. EB is best diagnosed and subclassified by the collective findings obtained via detailed personal and family history, in concert with the results of immunofluorescence antigenic mapping, transmission electron microscopy, and in some cases, by DNA analysis. Optimal patient management requires a multidisciplinary approach, and revolves around the protection of susceptible tissues against trauma, use of sophisticated wound care dressings, aggressive nutritional support, and early medical or surgical interventions to correct whenever possible the extracutaneous complications. Prognosis varies considerably and is based on both EB subtype and the overall health of the patient."
29753923,"Women with epilepsy need to continue to take anticonvulsants during their pregnancies to prevent seizures from occurring. Since the 1980's, it has been known that the use of valproate (an anticonvulsant) in the first trimester of pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of spina bifida. Recent studies have also demonstrated increased risks of other congenital anomalies as well as a risk of cognitive impairment. Doctors in the EU are now advised not to prescribe valproate in pregnant women, in women who can become pregnant or in girls unless other treatments are ineffective or not tolerated. This study aimed to determine if there has been a reduction in the numbers of babies born with valproate syndrome in Europe from 2005 to 2014. Data from 15 European congenital anomaly registries, who are members of EUROCAT (A European network of population-based registries for the epidemiologic surveillance of congenital anomalies), identified 28 cases of valproate syndrome in 2.74 million births from 2005 to 2014. The prevalence of valproate syndrome in Europe significantly decreased from 0.22 per 10,000 births in 2005/6 to 0.03 per 10,000 births in 2013/14. One registry, Ile de la Reunion, had the majority of cases (17). After excluding these cases there still remained a decreasing trend even though it no longer reached statistical significance due to the small number of cases. This study emphasises the continued need for European collaboration in analysing rare exposures and rare anomalies."
21381187,"BACKGROUND: As part of EUROCAT's surveillance of congenital anomalies in Europe, a statistical monitoring system has been developed to detect recent clusters or long-term (10 year) time trends. The purpose of this article is to describe the system for the identification and investigation of 10-year time trends, conceived as a ""screening"" tool ultimately leading to the identification of trends which may be due to changing teratogenic factors. METHODS: The EUROCAT database consists of all cases of congenital anomalies including livebirths, fetal deaths from 20 weeks gestational age, and terminations of pregnancy for fetal anomaly. Monitoring of 10-year trends is performed for each registry for each of 96 non-independent EUROCAT congenital anomaly subgroups, while Pan-Europe analysis combines data from all registries. The monitoring results are reviewed, prioritized according to a prioritization strategy, and communicated to registries for investigation. Twenty-one registries covering over 4 million births, from 1999 to 2008, were included in monitoring in 2010. CONCLUSIONS: Significant increasing trends were detected for abdominal wall anomalies, gastroschisis, hypospadias, Trisomy 18 and renal dysplasia in the Pan-Europe analysis while 68 increasing trends were identified in individual registries. A decreasing trend was detected in over one-third of anomaly subgroups in the Pan-Europe analysis, and 16.9% of individual registry tests. Registry preliminary investigations indicated that many trends are due to changes in data quality, ascertainment, screening, or diagnostic methods. Some trends are inevitably chance phenomena related to multiple testing, while others seem to represent real and continuing change needing further investigation and response by regional/national public health authorities."
22954482,"BACKGROUND: This study took advantage of a large population-based database of the Taiwan National Health Insurance (NHI) to investigate the epidemiology of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) in Taiwan. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study based on secondary analysis of prospectively collected data in the NHI system and governmental data on death registry in Taiwan during 1997-2007. By using the broad and narrow definitions for IPF, we estimated incidence and prevalence rates of IPF, and its associated clinical outcomes. RESULTS: The estimates of annual IPF incidence rates became more stable after 2000, ranging between 0.9 and 1.6 cases per 100,000 persons. The prevalence rates became more than twofold from 2000 to 2007 (from 2.8 to 6.4 cases per 100,000 persons for the broad definition, and from 2.0 to 4.9 cases per 100,000 persons for the narrow definition). Men of age older than 75 years had markedly higher incidence and prevalence rates than other groups. Around 40% of all incidences and about 30% of prevalent cases occurred in this population group. The median survival time after IPF diagnosis was 0.9 year (interquartile range (IQR), 0.2-2.5 years) and 0.7 year (IQR, 0.1-2.3 years) for the broad and narrow definitions, respectively. Progression of IPF was the leading cause of death, followed by cancer. CONCLUSIONS: In Taiwan, elderly men were the major group suffering from IPF. Survival time was short after IPF diagnosis, and the poor survival was largely attributable to quick IPF progression after diagnosis."
11581472,"OBJECTIVE:The prevalence rate of all types of limb reduction defects in general and those that potentially are caused by vascular disruption in particular is needed to provide a baseline for the evaluation of infants who are exposed in utero to teratogens that cause vascular disruption. The objective of this study was to determine this prevalence rate. METHODS:All infants with any limb deficiency among 161 252 liveborn and stillborn infants and elective terminations were identified in a hospital-based Active Malformations Surveillance Program in Boston in the years 1972 to 1974 and 1979 to 1994. An extensive search was made to identify infants who were missed by the Surveillance Program; an additional 8 infants (7.3% of total) were identified. The limb reduction defects were classified in 3 ways: 1) by the anatomic location of the defect, that is longitudinal, terminal, intercalary, etc; 2) for infants with absence/hypoplasia of fingers or toes, a tabulation of which digit or digits were affected; and 3) by apparent cause. RESULTS:The prevalence rate for all types of limb deficiency was 0.69/1000. The apparent causes included single mutant genes, familial occurrence, and known syndromes (24%); chromosome abnormalities (6%); teratogens (4%); vascular disruption (35%); and unknown cause (32%). CONCLUSIONS:A hospital-based surveillance program can be used to establish the prevalence of limb reduction defects, if ascertainment is extended to include elective terminations for fetal abnormalities. An apparent cause can be established for most limb defects when the clinical findings are used rather than reliance only on the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, codes of the discharge diagnoses. The prevalence rate of limb reduction defects as a result of presumed vascular disruption was 0.22/1000."
18408464,"To present the background of liver fluke-associated cholangiocarcinoma in Thailand focusing on recent epidemiological data and pathogenesis of this bile duct cancer.More systematic tumor registration in Thailand nowadays uncovers new high-incidence areas that are confined to not only the northeastern part but also some provinces in northern Thailand. The link between the liver fluke, Opisthorchis viverrini, and cholangiocarcinoma, particularly in terms of cellular and molecular pathogenesis, is further elucidated.Thailand is still the country with the highest incidence of cholangiocarcinoma in the world. Liver fluke induces chronic inflammation leading to oxidative DNA damage of the infected biliary epithelium and malignant transformation. Eradication of the fluke and identification of high-risk populations are urgently needed."
12902623,"To investigate the prevalence and genetic characteristics of myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) in Taiwan, DM-suspected patients and their families identified during the period of 1990-2001 had their clinical records reevaluated and the CTG repeat sizes at the DM1 locus examined. A total of 96 subjects belonging to 26 families were identified as DM1 patients, which gave a minimal disease prevalence of 0.46/100,000 inhabitants. Clinical anticipation was frequently observed in affected families, even in some parent-child pairs with transmission contraction of the CTG repeat size. The inverse correlation between age at onset and CTG repeat length was significant only in patients with small expansions. In addition, a DM1 carrier with a childhood-onset son was found to have CTG length heterogeneity in the range of 40-50, indicating that premutation alleles could be unstable during gametogenesis as well as in somatic tissues. Our data demonstrated that DM1 is a rare disease in Taiwan and showed that transmission contraction of repeat size is more likely to occur in alleles with large repeats."
23295463,"CONTEXT: TSH-secreting pituitary adenomas (TSHomas) are rare. Epidemiological data are scant and there are no reports on national incidence. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to estimate the national Swedish incidence and prevalence of TSHomas. DESIGN: This was an observational study. SETTING: The study was conducted at tertiary referral centers. PATIENTS: The Swedish Pituitary Registry and World Health Organization International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems coding at all university hospitals were used to identify patients diagnosed with TSHomas 1990-2010. The identified patients' medical records were studied until the latest follow-up [median 5.0 years (range < 1-20 years)]. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Incidence, prevalence, demographics, tumor characteristics, treatment outcome, and thyroid hormone level at diagnosis were measured. RESULTS: The age-standardized national incidence of 28 TSHoma patients was 0.15 per 1 million inhabitants per year, with an increasing incidence over time (0.05 per 1 million per year in 1990-1994 to 0.26 per 1 million per year in 2005-2009). The national prevalence in 2010 was 2.8 per 1 million inhabitants, in which 0.85 per 1 million had active disease. Most patients (n = 22) underwent pituitary surgery, 5 had radiotherapy, and 6 had somatostatin analogues. Eighteen patients were considered cured at the latest follow-up; 25% remained uncontrolled. Subjects treated for putative primary hyperthyroidism prior to diagnosis had TSH levels more than double those with intact thyroid at diagnosis (P = .013). The median time to diagnosis was longer for women than men (4 vs < 1 year, P = .026). More women than men were treated surgically (94.1% vs 54.5%, P = .022). CONCLUSION: This is the first estimate of a national incidence of TSHoma. Additional epidemiological studies are needed to compare these results with other geographical areas. This study suggests an increased incidence of TSHomas, in agreement with reports on other pituitary adenomas."
21976764,"Invasive group A streptococcal (GAS) infections cause significant morbidity and mortality. A national survey was initiated to assess the burden of invasive GAS infections in France, describe their clinical characteristics, and assess the molecular characteristics of GAS strains responsible for these infections. The survey was conducted in 194 hospitals, accounting for 51% of acute care hospital admissions in France. Clinical data, predisposing factors, and demographic data were obtained, and all GAS isolates were emm sequence typed. We identified 664 cases of invasive GAS infections, with an annual incidence of 3.1 per 100,000 population. The case-fatality ratio was 14% and rose to 43% in the case of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. Bacteremia without identified focus (22%) and skin/soft tissue infections (30%) were the most frequent clinical presentations. Necrotizing fasciitis was frequent in adults (18%) and uncommon in children (3%). The 3 predominant emm types were emm1, emm89, and emm28, accounting for 33%, 16%, and 10% of GAS isolates, respectively. The emm1 type was associated with fatal outcomes and was more frequent in children than in adults. Six clusters of cases were identified, with each cluster involving 2 invasive cases due to GAS strains which shared identical GAS emm sequence types. Four clusters of cases involved eight postpartum infections, one family cluster involved a mother and child, and one cluster involved two patients in a nursing home. Invasive GAS infection is one of the most severe bacterial diseases in France, particularly in persons aged ≥ 50 years or when associated with toxic shock syndrome."
20553527,"Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) was first described in the 1800s, but it was not until the 1980s when it was convincingly attributed to human papilloma virus (HPV). RRP is categorized into juvenile onset and adult onset depending on presentation before or after the age of 12 years, respectively. The prevalence of this disease is likely variable depending on the age of presentation, country and socioeconomic status of the population being studied, but is generally accepted to be between 1 and 4 per 100 000. Despite the low prevalence, the economic burden of RRP is high given the multiple procedures required by patients. Multiple studies have shown that the most likely route of transmission of HPV in RRP is from mother to child during labor. Exceptions to this may include patients with congenital RRP who have been exposed in utero and adult patients who may have been exposed during sexual contact. Although cesarean section may prevent the exposure of children to the HPV virus during childbirth, its effectiveness in preventing RRP is debatable and the procedure itself carries an increased risk of complications. The quadrivalent HPV vaccine holds the most promise for the prevention of RRP by eliminating the maternal reservoir for HPV."
3472423,"One hundred and forty-four patients with hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy (HMSN) were selected from within a defined area (Cantabria) in Northern Spain, from 1974 to 1984. The series comprises 49 index cases and 95 affected relatives. The prevalence ratio was 28.2 cases per 100,000. The results of the study indicate that the majority of the cases were hereditary as a dominant trait. The prevalence for the Type I HMSN cases did not differ from that of Type II cases. Previous population-surveys of these disorders are compared."
9556302,"Our objective was to review the Australasian experience of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), to compare the spectrum of disease seen in Australasia with previously published data from elsewhere, and to assess the reliability of carrier testing. Study design was a retrospective review of records collected over a 15-year period, the setting was an international referral laboratory for the study of metabolic disease, and the subjects were all known cases of ALD diagnosed in Australia and New Zealand between 1981 and 1996 and their families. We estimate that the combined incidence of ALD and its variants in Australasia is at least 1.6 per 100,000. Of 95 affected males, 51 had cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy, 24 had adrenomyeloneuropathy, 15 had Addison's disease only, and 5 remained asymptomatic when last examined. However, the distribution of phenotypes among newly diagnosed patients has changed substantially over the last 15 years, with cerebral forms of the disease forming a decreasing proportion of new diagnoses. The measurement of plasma very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) alone detects 93% of women who can be proven to be carriers. The addition of genetic linkage studies or assay of VLCFAs in cultured fibroblasts improved this detection rate to the point that there were no obligate carriers who could not be detected using a combination of two or more techniques."
24761987,"Mastocytosis is a heterogeneous group of diseases characterized by abnormal proliferation of mast cells. Systemic mastocytosis (SM), in which abnormal mast cells are present in tissues beyond the skin, is divided into seven subcategories with varying degrees of severity and prognosis. Very little is known about the epidemiology of SM and its subcategories. This retrospective cohort study of 548 adults with SM diagnosed 1997-2010 was constructed using linked Danish national health registries. The most common subtype of mastocytosis was indolent SM (including urticaria pigmentosa) (n = 450; 82%), followed by SM with subtype unknown (n = 61; 11%), SM with associated clonal haematological non-mast cell lineage disease (n = 24; 4%), aggressive SM (n = 8; 2%), and mast cell leukaemia (n = 5; 1%). The incidence rate for SM (all subtypes including urticaria pigmentosa) was 0·89 per 100 000 per year. Cumulative incidence was 12·46 per 100 000, and the 14-year limited-duration prevalence as of 1 January, 2011 was 9·59 per 100 000. This nationwide cohort from Denmark is the first population-based epidemiological study of mastocytosis. In this cohort of patients aged 15 years and older, SM was found to be overall relatively rare with notable variation by subtype for patient characteristics, survival and epidemiological measures."
11113084,"BACKGROUND & AIMS:The epidemiology of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) has not been studied systematically in the United States. We report the incidence and prevalence of this condition in the general population. We also examined the validity of the Mayo natural history model for PBC among these unselected patients from the community. METHODS:The Rochester Epidemiology Project entails a computerized index of diagnoses from the health care encounters of residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota. For potential cases identified using this database, the complete (inpatient and outpatient) medical records were reviewed to verify the diagnosis and extract information necessary for the application of the Mayo model. We estimated the incidence and prevalence of PBC in this population and compared the actual survival of patients with PBC in the community with the survival predicted for PBC patients by the Mayo natural history model. RESULTS:The age-adjusted (to 1990 U.S. whites) incidence of PBC per 100,000 person-years for years 1975-1995 was 4.5 (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.1-5.9) for women, 0.7 (95% CI, 0.1-1.3) for men, and 2.7 (95% CI, 1.9-3.5) overall. The age- and sex-adjusted prevalence per 100,000 persons as of 1995 was 65.4 (95% CI, 43.0-87.9) for women, 12.1 (95% CI, 1.1-23.1) for men, and 40.2 (95% CI, 27.2-53.1) overall. The Mayo natural history model accurately predicted the actual survival of these patients. CONCLUSIONS:This first description of the epidemiology of PBC in the United States indicates that its incidence and prevalence in this country are among the highest reported. Outcomes among these unselected patients from a community population further validated the Mayo natural history model of PBC."
22032242,"BACKGROUND: Anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) antibody-mediated disease is rare and classically presents with the syndrome of glomerulonephritis and pulmonary haemorrhage. AIM: This aim of this report was to determine the incidence, clinical features, management and outcomes of anti-GBM disease in Auckland between 1998 and 2008. METHODS: Potential patients were identified by a search for positive anti-GBM antibody serology, diagnostic renal biopsy, or in-hospital admissions using International Classification of Diseases 9 and 10 codes between 1998 and 2008. A retrospective case notes review of all potential cases was performed with data censored at 31 December 2010. RESULTS: Twenty-three cases were identified. The rate of anti-GBM disease was estimated at 1.79 per million person-years. There were 12 men and 11 women. The median age was 45 years, range 12-74 years. Sixteen patients were European, three were Pacific peoples, three were NZ Maori and one was Chinese. Eleven were regular smokers and eight ex-smokers, significantly higher proportions than the population (P ≤ 0.001). Smokers were significantly more likely to have respiratory disease (P= 0.03). The mean creatinine at presentation was 474 µmol/L. All patients had a renal biopsy; 20 had crescentic glomerulonephritis. One patient recovered renal function without treatment. Twenty-two were immunosuppressed with cyclophosphamide and corticosteroids. Seventeen received plasmapheresis. Eighteen were alive, eight with end-stage renal disease, two with chronic kidney disease and eight with normal renal function. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-GBM disease is a rare condition, which is not overrepresented among indigenous people. With aggressive therapy the prognosis has improved; however, the morbidity and mortality of this condition remain significant."
15653965,"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the main clinical features, genetic mutations, and outcomes of patients of the French Congenital Central Hypoventilation Syndrome (CCHS) Registry. DESIGN: A country-wide cohort established throughout a long-term multicenter effort. PATIENTS: Seventy French patients with CCHS (29 male patients and 41 female patients). METHODS: The following items were analyzed: the most important moments of the disease course; the main clinical characteristics; associated pathologic conditions; management; clinical outcome; and genetic mutations. RESULTS: An average of four new cases of CCHS per year was observed in the last 5 years. Thus, the incidence may be estimated to be 1 per 200,000 live births in France. The median age at diagnosis was 3.5 months (range, 0.5 to 15 months) before 1995 and < 2 weeks in the last 5 years (p = 0.01). CCHS occurred in isolation in 58 of 70 patients. In the remainder, it was associated with Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) [nine patients], Hirschsprung and neural crest tumor (two patients), and growth hormone deficiency (one patient). Among the 50 patients who lived beyond 1 year of age, all but one received nighttime ventilation, with 10 of them (20%) receiving it noninvasively. Three patients (6%) required daytime ventilatory support in addition to nighttime ventilation. The overall mortality rate was 38% (95% confidence interval [CI], 27 to 49%). The median age at death was 3 months (range, 0.4 months to 21 years). The 2-year mortality rate was greater in male patients than in female patients (p = 0.02; relative risk [RR], 2.71; 95% CI, 1.14 to 6.47) but was not affected by HSCR (p = 0.93; RR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.28 to 3.2). The 43 patients who are currently alive (11 men; sex ratio, 0.4) have a mean age of 9 years (range, 2 months to 27 years). Among the 34 patients tested thus far, heterozygous mutations of the paired-like homeobox gene 2B (PHOX2B) gene were found in 31 patients (91%). CONCLUSION: Our four major findings are the extreme rarity of CCHS, the improved recognition over time, the lack of effect of HSCR on the mortality rate, and the high frequency of PHOX2B mutations."
20880268,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prevalence of Parkinson's disease (PD) and atypical parkinsonian syndromes (APS) in a rural Japanese district. METHOD: Collaboration with the medical institutions, the long-term care insurance system facilities, and the public health office. RESULTS: The crude prevalence rates were 175 per 100,000 (95% CI: 143-206) for PD, 18 (8-28) for progressive supranuclear palsy, 17 (7-26) for multiple system atrophy (MSA), and 9 (2-16) for corticobasal degeneration. The age-adjusted prevalence rates were 109 per 100,000 (88-134), 10 (2-17), 13 (4-21), and 6 (0-12), for each condition. There was a preponderance of women with PD and of men with APS. Nine of the 116 PD patients and 7 of the 29 APS patients were newly diagnosed in this study. CONCLUSIONS: There are high prevalence rates for PD and APS and suboptimal recognition of APS. This is the first epidemiological prevalence study of MSA from Japan."
9409395,"To estimate an annual number of patients treated for Moyamoya disease in Japan and to describe the clinico-epidemiological features, a nationwide epidemiological survey was conducted in 1995. The study consisted of two questionnaires, which were distributed to departments randomly selected, of neurosurgery, neurology and pediatrics in hospitals throughout Japan. The first questionnaire inquired the number of the patients treated in 1994 and the second one detailed clinico-epidemiological information of each patient reported. Following major epidemiological findings emerged from the study: (a) The total annual number of patients treated for Moyamoya disease was estimated as 3900 (95% confidence interval (CI) 3500-4400) in Japan 1994, with the prevalence and incidence rates of 3.16 and 0.35 per 100,000 population, respectively; (b) the sex ratio (females to males) of the patients was 1.8; (c) the peak of age distribution of the patients was observed in 10-14 years old and a smaller peak in their forties; (d) the age at onset was under 10 years old in 47.8% of the patients, but some had developed the disease at the age of 25-49 years; (e) family history of Moyamoya disease was found in 10.0% of the patients; and (f) about 75% of the patients had normal activity of daily life or working ability even before treatment. The present findings were quite comparable with those obtained in the previous nationwide epidemiological survey in 1990."
23049806,"Posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy (PPCD) is a rare autosomal dominant genetically heterogeneous disorder. Nineteen Czech PPCD pedigrees with 113 affected family members were identified, and 17 of these kindreds were genotyped for markers on chromosome 20p12.1- 20q12. Comparison of haplotypes in 81 affected members, 20 unaffected first degree relatives and 13 spouses, as well as 55 unrelated controls, supported the hypothesis of a shared ancestor in 12 families originating from one geographic location. In 38 affected individuals from nine of these pedigrees, a common haplotype was observed between D20S48 and D20S107 spanning approximately 23 Mb, demonstrating segregation of disease with the PPCD1 locus. This haplotype was not detected in 110 ethnically matched control chromosomes. Within the common founder haplotype, a core mini-haplotype was detected for D20S605, D20S182 and M189K2 in all 67 affected members from families 1-12, however alleles representing the core mini-haplotype were also detected in population matched controls. The most likely location of the responsible gene within the disease interval, and estimated mutational age, were inferred by linkage disequilibrium mapping (DMLE+2.3). The appearance of a disease-causing mutation was dated between 64-133 generations. The inferred ancestral locus carrying a PPCD1 disease-causing variant within the disease interval spans 60 Kb on 20p11.23, which contains a single known protein coding gene, ZNF133. However, direct sequence analysis of coding and untranslated exons did not reveal a potential pathogenic mutation. Microdeletion or duplication was also excluded by comparative genomic hybridization using a dense chromosome 20 specific array. Geographical origin, haplotype and statistical analysis suggest that in 14 unrelated families an as yet undiscovered mutation on 20p11.23 was inherited from a common ancestor. Prevalence of PPCD in the Czech Republic appears to be the highest worldwide and our data suggests that at least one other novel locus for PPCD also exists."
19604432,"The frequency of primary systemic small vessel vasculitides (PSV) varies among different geographic regions and age categories. We studied PSV in patients from middle-eastern Crete (Greece), and compared clinical characteristics in younger (<65 years) versus older (> or = 65 years) adult patients.The records of 67 patients (33 younger, 34 older adults) diagnosed with PSV during 1995-2003 who were referred to a mixed secondary/tertiary care University Hospital in Crete were reviewed. Data on clinical manifestations, diagnosis, therapy, and adverse outcomes (end stage renal disease, death) during a median follow-up of 6 (range 0-12) years were recorded. Multivariate regression analysis was applied to identify independent predictors for adverse outcomes.The overall annual incidence of PSV was 19.5/million (95% confidence interval [CI] 15.7-23.4), 48.9/million (95% CI 33.8-63.9) in older and 12.4/million (95% CI 7.7-17) in younger adults. Microscopic polyangiitis was more prevalent in older patients (65%) and Wegener's Granulomatosis in younger patients (52%). Thirty-one percent of older patients developed end-stage renal disease as compared to 11% of younger patients (p=0.103). Mortality rates were 60% in older patients and 19% in younger patients (p=0.001). In multivariate regression analysis age (Beta=0.33 per 1-year, p=0.005), serum creatinine (Beta=0.29 per 1-mg/dL, p=0.011), and lung involvement (Beta=0.36, p=0.002) at the time of diagnosis were independent predictors for end stage renal disease and/or death.This study documents increased frequency and significant mortality of PSV among older people in Crete, with MPA being the most prevalent type. Age, serum creatinine, and lung involvement are important predictors for adverse outcome in these patients."
22554029,"A total of 28 Norwegians have been diagnosed with hereditary tyrosinaemia type I (HT1) over the last 30 years. In this study, 19 of these patients were investigated. Three novel small deletions were found (NM_000137.1(FAH): c.615delT, p.Phe205LeufsX2, NM_000137.1(FAH): c.744delG, p.Pro249HisfsX55 and NM_000137.1(FAH):c835delC) pGln279ArgfsX25, all of them leading to a change in the reading frame and a premature stop codon. We hereby genetically characterized 51 of the 56 disease-causing alleles, identifying nine different disease-causing mutations in the Norwegian population. We found that 65% of the Norwegian HT1 patients are compound heterozygous for different mutations. Thus, the relatively high incidence of HT1 in Norway of 1 in 74,800 live births is not due to single founder effects or high incidence of parental consanguinity."
28526779,"The recent discovery of mutations in the gene encoding diacylglycerol kinase ε (DGKE) identified a novel pathophysiologic mechanism leading to HUS and/or MPGN. We report ten new patients from eight unrelated kindreds with DGKE nephropathy. We combined these cases with all previously published cases to characterize the phenotypic spectrum and outcomes of this new disease entity. Most patients presented with HUS accompanied by proteinuria, whereas a subset of patients exhibited clinical and histologic patterns of MPGN without TMA. We also report the first two patients with clinical and histologic HUS/MPGN overlap. DGKE-HUS typically manifested in the first year of life but was not exclusively limited to infancy, and viral triggers frequently preceded HUS episodes. We observed signs of complement activation in some patients with DGKE-HUS, but the role of complement activation remains unclear. Most patients developed a slowly progressive proteinuric nephropathy: 80% of patients did not have ESRD within 10 years of diagnosis. Many patients experienced HUS remission without specific treatment, and a few patients experienced HUS recurrence despite complete suppression of the complement pathway. Five patients received renal allografts, with no post-transplant recurrence reported. In conclusion, we did not observe a clear genotype-phenotype correlation in patients with DGKE nephropathy, suggesting additional factors mediating phenotypic heterogeneity. Furthermore, the benefits of anti-complement therapy are questionable but renal transplant may be a feasible option in the treatment of patients with this condition."
11793473,"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT or Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by aberrant vascular development. We report here a genetic epidemiologic study in a county, A, in the Akita prefecture (population 1.2 million) located in northern Japan. Nine HHT patients who had been referred to tertiary-care hospitals were located in and near the study county. A total of 137 pedigree members were traced of which 81 were alive and 32 were affected by HHT. Complications associated with cerebral or pulmonary arteriovenous malformations were proven in six out of seven families. Linkage analysis in two large families revealed a weak yet suggestive linkage to the HHT1 locus (encoding endoglin; ENG). Three novel mutations were found in four families, all of which led to a frameshift: a G to C transversion at the splicing donor site of intron 3 (Inv3+1 G>C) in one family, one base pair insertion (A) at nucleotide 828 (exon 7) of the endoglin cDNA in two large families (c.828-829 ins A), and a four base pair deletion (AAAG) beginning with nucleotide 1120 (exon 8) of the endoglin cDNA (c.1120-1123 delAAAG) in one family. The insertion of A in exon 11 (c.1470-1471 insA) mutation found in one family has also been reported in a European family. No endoglin gene mutations were found in two families. The population prevalence of HHT in the county was estimated to be 1:8,000 approximately 1:5,000, roughly comparable with those reported in European and U.S. populations, which is contradictory to the traditional view that HHT is rare among Asians. We recommend that families with HHT be screened for gene mutations in order that high-risk individuals receive early diagnosis and treatment initiation that will substantially alter their clinical course and prognosis."
23706409,"OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine the incidence and prevalence of LKS in Japanese children. METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to all 3004 Japanese hospitals that have a department of pediatrics. The questionnaire asked for the number of first-visit LKS patients and LKS patients who were followed up at or visited their clinic during the past one year Vital statistics of the same year (2008) published by Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, Japan were referenced to calculate the estimated incidence and prevalence of LKS among Japanese children. RESULTS: Chiefs of 1562 pediatric departments answered our inquiry (51.9% of returns). Six chiefs had one new LKS patient, aged 6-14 years. Thirty two patients with LKS were followed in the same period. The number of children with LKS less than 20 years of age who needed medical care was at least 23 and at most 31. Vital statistics of Japan 2009 revealed that the population of children aged 5-14 years was 11,861,464 and that aged 5-19 years was 18,007,968. DISCUSSION: The number of the first-visit LKS patients was 6 in a year. We estimated the incidence of LKS in the 5- to 14-years-old Japanese population as about 1 in 978,000. The number of LKS patients aged 5-19 was estimated to range from 44.2 to 59.6 among a population of 18,007,968. This means the prevalence of LKS under medical care is roughly one in 302,147-407,420 children aged 5-19. This study is the first epidemiological estimation of the incidence and prevalence of children with LKS in Japan or, for that matter, in any other area. CONCLUSION: (1) Incidence of children with LKS aged 5-14 years was about 1 in a million in Japan. (2) Prevalence of children with LKS aged 5-19 and under medical care was one in about 300,000-410,000 in Japan. (3) This study constitutes the first epidemiological estimation of LKS in Japan."
19039240,"BACKGROUND:Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorder, with a variable reported prevalence ranging from 0.5 to 12 per 100,000. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the prevalence of HSP and estimate the percentage of SPG4 mutations in the Estonian population. METHODS:A simple model with multiple data sources was selected to enable as many patients as possible to be detected. All relevant case histories from Estonian regional neurological centers for the last 20 years were reviewed; all neurologists and general practitioners were contacted. RESULTS:A total of 737 case records were captured for secondary evaluation. Among these cases, 88 potential HSP-affected subjects were identified. During this study 59 patients with HSP were identified, giving a crude prevalence rate of 4.4 per 100,000. Eleven persons (21.6% of all studied Estonian HSP patients) with HSP were found to have mutations in the spastin gene (SPG4). CONCLUSIONS:Our epidemiological data are comparable with the results from epidemiological studies performed elsewhere, indicating that the clinical diagnostic management of HSP patients in Estonia is adequate and the chosen methodological approach for data collection was reliable."
6454342,"The records of an ongoing health surveillance registry that utilizes multiple sources of ascertainment were used to study the incidence rate of congenital malformations of the anterior abdominal wall in live-born children in British Columbia during the period 1964--1978 inclusive. No overall increase in incidence rate of these anomalies was detected during the study period. The estimated live-born incidence rates were: one in 4,175 live births for omphalocoele, one in 12,328 live births for gastroschisis, and one in 29,231 live births for prune belly. The data were analyzed with regard to sex and associated anomalies. Some practical implications regarding assessment of these infants are discussed."
21750884,"The prevalence of eosinophilic esophagitis (EE) is increasing rapidly in Western countries. Several case series of EE have also been reported in Japan. However, the prevalence of EE in Japanese patients as investigated by upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is unknown. Therefore, we carried out a prospective multicenter study to address this issue.From July to December 2010, 23,346 patients who had undergone routine upper gastrointestinal endoscopy in 17 institutions were enrolled. In patients with symptoms suggesting EE, such as dysphasia, food impaction, and heartburn, and/or in patients in whom endoscopic findings suggested pathology, esophageal biopsy samples were collected, and the numbers of eosinophils in the squamous epithelium were counted.During the study period of 6 months, 4 patients were endoscopically and histologically diagnosed with EE. The prevalence of EE was calculated to be 17.1/100,000.The prevalence of EE in Japanese patients by upper gastrointestinal endoscopy has now been documented."
2010159,"The sex-specific and age-specific incidence rates of the major parenchymal liver diseases in a North European population were estimated using a computerized registry of all admissions to somatic hospitals in Denmark. The incidence was calculated by counting all incident cases of these diseases reported to the registry in the 5-yr period 1981 to 1985 and dividing the number of cases by the number of person-years at risk in this period. The incidence rates (per million person-years) were for men and women, respectively: infectious hepatitis, 109 and 71; toxic hepatitis, 19 and 22; chronic hepatitis, 27 and 29; alcoholic cirrhosis, 190 and 85; nonalcoholic nonbiliary cirrhosis, 110 and 82; primary biliary cirrhosis, 4 and 14. The pattern of the age-specific incidence rates was similar in men and women in infectious hepatitis, alcoholic cirrhosis, nonalcoholic nonbiliary cirrhosis and primary biliary cirrhosis. Toxic and chronic hepatitis had a higher incidence in women than in men only in older age groups. The incidence of idiopathic hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease, secondary biliary cirrhosis, portal vein thrombosis and Budd-Chiari's syndrome were less than four in both sexes."
20465592,"BACKGROUND: Studies of achalasia epidemiology are important as they often yield new insights into disease etiology. In this study, our objective was to carry out the first North American population-based study of achalasia epidemiology using a governmental administrative database. METHODS: All residents in the province of Alberta, Canada receive universal healthcare coverage as a benefit. The provincial health ministry, Alberta Health and Wellness, maintains a central stakeholder database of patient demographic information and physician billing claims. We defined an achalasia case as a billing claim submitted for the years 1996-2007 with an ICD-9-CM code of 530.0 or 530 and a Canadian Classification of Procedure treatment code of 54.92A (endoscopic balloon dilation) or 54.6 (esophagomyotomy). A preliminary validation study of the case definition demonstrated a sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 99% for known cases and controls. KEY RESULTS: A total of 463 achalasia cases were identified from 1995 to 2008 (59.6% males). Mean age at diagnosis was 53.1 years. In 2007, the achalasia incidence was 1.63/100,000 (95% CI 1.20, 2.06) and the prevalence was 10.82/100,000 (95% CI 9.70, 11.93). We observed a steady increase in the overall prevalence rate from 2.51/100,000 in 1996 to 10.82/100,000 in 2007. Survival of achalasia cases was significantly less than age-sex matched population controls (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: Using a population-based approach, the incidence and prevalence of treated achalasia is 1.63/100,000 and 10.82/100,000, respectively. The disease appears to have a stable incidence but a rising prevalence. Survival of achalasia cases is significantly less than age-matched healthy controls."
21782147,"BACKGROUND: Pyoderma gangrenosum is a condition that is included among the neutrophilic dermatoses. Given its low incidence, few studies have addressed its epidemiology or treatment. OBJECTIVE: To describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with pyoderma gangrenosum along with our experience of treating the condition in a referral hospital in Malaga, Spain. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective, observational study was undertaken in the Department of Dermatology at Hospital Clínico Universitario Virgen de la Victoria in Malaga, Spain between January 2000 and December 2009 and included all patients diagnosed with pyoderma gangrenosum. RESULTS: The incidence of pyoderma gangrenosum in our reference population is 3.26 cases per million inhabitants per year. The most frequent concomitant systemic disease was ulcerative colitis (5 cases, 33%). In 4 patients with that disease, pyoderma gangrenosum appeared during a flare-up. In 80% of cases, patients were not referred to a dermatologist during the initial phase of pyoderma gangrenosum, and most referrals were from gastroenterology or general surgery (4 patients each, 52%). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with pyoderma gangrenosum are often referred to dermatologists by other specialists after a varying period of time has elapsed without achieving an accurate diagnosis. In these patients, especially those between 20 and 40 years of age, it is essential to rule out concomitant disease. Adalimumab is a good treatment option for pyoderma gangrenosum."
23025761,"In Italy, the nationwide newborn screening programme for congenital hypothyroidism (CH) represents an integrated approach to the disease including screening tests, diagnosis, treatment, follow up and nation-wide surveillance of the disease. The latter is performed by the Italian National Registry of Infants with Congenital Hypothyroidism (INRICH). The INRICH is a population-based Registry, this implies that results obtained in the analyses conducted on the data collected in the INRICH are highly representative, can be easily used to improve the health of CH children, and provide information critical to understanding the etiology of the disease. Over the years, the INRICH has contributed: i) to improve procedures for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of affected babies, by identifying critical points in screening program procedures; ii) to estimate the incidence of CH and the prevalence of the different forms of the disease (thyroid dysgenesis, normally located and shaped thyroid) in our country; iii) to provide a unique opportunity for research into this condition given the large amount and the high quality of information collected in this registry."
20664057,"Changing definitions and classifications of hematologic malignancies (HMs) complicate incidence comparisons. HAEMACARE classified HMs into groupings consistent with the latest World Health Organization classification and useful for epidemiologic and public health purposes. We present crude, age-specific and age-standardized incidence rates for European HMs according to these groupings, estimated from 66,371 lymphoid malignancies (LMs) and 21,796 myeloid malignancies (MMs) registered in 2000-2002 by 44 European cancer registries, grouped into 5 regions. Age-standardized incidence rates were 24.5 (per 100,000) for LMs and 7.55 for MMs. The commonest LMs were plasma cell neoplasms (4.62), small B-cell lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphatic leukemia (3.79), diffuse B-cell lymphoma (3.13), and Hodgkin lymphoma (2.41). The commonest MMs were acute myeloid leukemia (2.96), other myeloproliferative neoplasms (1.76), and myelodysplastic syndrome (1.24). Unknown morphology LMs were commonest in Northern Europe (7.53); unknown morphology MMs were commonest in Southern Europe (0.73). Overall incidence was lowest in Eastern Europe and lower in women than in men. For most LMs, incidence was highest in Southern Europe; for MMs incidence was highest in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Differences in diagnostic and registration criteria are an important cause of incidence variation; however, different distribution of HM risk factors also contributes. The quality of population-based HM data needs further improvement."
9439667,"An epidemiological study of the mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) in Northern Ireland using multiple ascertainment sources was carried out and the incidence rate for the period 1958-1985 was estimated. An incidence of approximately 1 in 76,000 live births was obtained for MPS 1H (Hurler phenotype); 1 in 280,000 for MPS 1 H/S (Hurler/Scheie phenotype); 1 in 140,000 live births (1 in 72,000 male live births) for MPS II (Hunter syndrome); 1 in 280,000 for MPS III (Sanfilippo syndrome) and 1 in 76,000 for MPS IV A (Morquio syndrome type A). No cases of MPS IS (Scheie phenotype), MPS IV B (Morquio syndrome type B) or MPS VI (Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome) were ascertained during the study period. Three cases of non-immune hydrops fetalis born to consanguineous parents were thought to be due to beta-glucuronidase deficiency (MPS VII) on the basis of placental histology and enzyme studies on both parents but no living cases of MPS VII were ascertained. The overall incidence for all types of mucopolysaccharidosis was approximately 1 in 25,000 live births. A comparison is made with incidence estimates obtained from other published studies."
10421645,"There is a widespread impression that the number of patients with the autoimmune liver disease primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is increasing, although its incidence and prevalence vary widely. Using thorough case-finding methods and rigorous definitions to assess changes in incidence and prevalence with time and to explore the symptomatology and mortality of the disease in a large group of unselected patients, we performed a descriptive epidemiological study of PBC in a well defined population over a fixed period of time using established diagnostic criteria and with clinical follow-up of all cases. In a population of 2.05 million in northern England 770 definite or probable PBC cases were identified. Prevalence rose from 201.9 per 10(6) in the adult population and 541. 4 per 10(6) women over 40 in 1987 to 334.6 per 10(6) adults and 939. 8 per 10(6) women over 40 in 1994. Incidence was 23 per 10(6) in 1987 and 32.2 per 10(6) in 1994. Three hundred patients died in median follow-up of 6.27 years (141 liver deaths); the standardized mortality ratio was 2.85. At presumed diagnosis, 60.9% had no symptoms of liver disease. By June 1994 62% of prevalent patients had liver symptoms. PBC is apparently increasing. It is still unclear whether this is because of a true increase, case finding, or increased disease awareness. The study draws attention to (1) high mortality from liver disease and non-liver-related causes even in patients initially with no liver symptoms and (2) apparently poor diagnostic awareness of the disease."
12555210,"Severe chronic neutropenia (SCN) is defined as an absolute neutrophil (ANC) of less than 0.5 x 10(9)/L, lasting for months or years. Congenital, cyclic, and idiopathic neutropenia are principal categories of SCN. Since 1994, the Severe Chronic Neutropenia International Registry (SCNIR) has collected data to monitor the clinical course, treatments, and disease outcomes for SCN patients. This report summarizes data for 853 patients, almost all treated with daily or alternate-day recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF or Filgrastim). G-CSF treatment increased the ANC overall from 0.34 x 10(9)/L +/- 0.018 pre-treatment to 3.70 x 10(9)/L +/- 0.18 during the first year of treatment. For most patients, the responses were durable with patients remaining on the same dose of G-CSF for many years. Long-term hematological observations showed stable mean leukocyte and neutrophil counts and gradually increasing hemoglobin levels. Thrombocytopenia developed in 4% of patients. As of January 1, 2000, myelodysplasia (MDS) or acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) has occurred in 35 of 387 patients with congenital neutropenia with a cumulative risk of 13% after 8 years of G-CSF treatment. This event occurred without a predictable relationship to the duration or dose of G-CSF treatment. No patients with cyclic or idiopathic neutropenia developed MDS or AML. Other important adverse events included hepatomegaly, osteoporosis, vasculitis, glomerulonephritis, and deaths in 4 of 14 cases requiring splenectomy. Growth and development and the outcome of pregnancy appeared to be unaffected by G-CSF treatment. These data indicate that congenital, cyclic, and idiopathic neutropenia can be effectively treated with long-term G-CSF. The risk of leukemia, osteoporosis, other potentially adverse events, and pregnancy outcome need to be further evaluated with continuing long-term observations."

23412609,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to perform a systematic evaluation of morbidity and mortality in type B Niemann-Pick disease. METHODS: A total of 103 patients with Niemann-Pick disease (49 males, 54 females, age range: 1-72 years) participated in natural history studies through Mount Sinai's International Center for Types A and B Niemann-Pick Disease between 1992 and 2012. RESULTS: Serious morbidities included significant neurological, hepatic, and cardiac disease. Thirteen patients had some degree of neurological impairment. Nine patients had cirrhosis or liver failure requiring transplantation. Coronary artery and valvular heart disease were present in nine patients. Of note, only four patients were oxygen dependent, although progressive pulmonary disease is a well-described feature of Niemann-Pick disease. During the follow-up period, 18 deaths occurred. The median age of death was 15.5 years (range 1-72). Causes of death included pneumonia, liver failure, and hemorrhage. The majority of deaths (12 of 18) occurred in patients <21 years, yielding a mortality rate of 19% in the pediatric population. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that Niemann-Pick disease is a life-threatening disorder with significant morbidity and mortality, especially in the pediatric population. The information collected in this series highlights the need for safe, effective therapy for Niemann-Pick disease."
19068582,"Irreversible sequels of some genetic diseases can be prevented by neonatal screening. The aim of this paper was to verify the prevalence of diseases diagnosed by the National Program of Neonatal Screening (PNTN) in Maringá, Paraná, Brazil, between 2001 and 2006. This cross-sectional descriptive study included 20,529 newborn infants screened by that program. Out of those, 859 were re-examined, and 21 had the disease confirmed. Considering all screened newborn infants and the number of diagnostics per disease, the following disease prevalence was determine: phenylketonuria--1:20,529; congenital hypothyrodism--1:2,281; hemoglobinopahies--1:3,421; cystic fibrosis--1:10,264; and biotinidase deficiency--1:6,843. Understanding disease status and prevalence of newborns in a population allows the establishment and the improvement of public policies aimed at the children."
18565978,"The epidemiology of renal vasculitis in different populations is poorly understood. A recent study from Japan suggests that whilst the overall incidence is similar to that reported from Europe, the clinical phenotype is different, with Wegener's granulomatosis being very much less common. The aim of this study was to compare the incidence of renal vasculitis in the UK with recent data from a Japanese population. Methods. Incident patients with renal vasculitis were identified prospectively between 2000 and 2004 from a well-defined UK population. The case notes were reviewed and clinical features extracted. Classification between Wegener's granulomatosis, microscopic polyangiitis and Churg Strauss syndrome was performed using a predetermined algorithm. Inclusion criteria were (i) new patients with vasculitis with or without histological confirmation, (ii) renal involvement and (iii) positive serology for anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA).We identified 27 cases of renal vasculitis (Wegener's granulomatosis 13, microscopic polyangiitis 11, Churg Strauss syndrome 3) fulfilling the case definition. The overall average age was 63.5 years which is less than those of the Japanese patients. The overall annual incidence of renal vasculitis was 12.2/million similar to Japan. The annual incidence of Wegener's granulomatosis was 5.8/million, microscopic polyangiitis 4.9/million and Churg Strauss syndrome 1.4/million. ENT and neurological involvement were much less common in Japan. No patients with cANCA/PR3 were seen in Japan. Wegener's granumolatosis seems to be much less common in Japan than the UK. Discussion. Whilst the overall occurrence of renal vasculitis is similar in Japan to the UK, the clinical phenotype is very different with microscopic polyangiitis predominating in Japan."
6208718,"The annual incidence of IgA-positive dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) during the years 1976-1981 in Gothenburg, Sweden, a city with approximately 430000 inhabitants, was estimated prospectively. The mean annual incidence was 1.1 per 10(5) inhabitants. The prevalence of DH as at 31 December, 1981 was 22.9 per 10(5) inhabitants or 19.6 if patients in long-standing spontaneous remission were excluded. These figures probably represent the minimum overall prevalence rate."
25689425,"Patients with the 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 microdeletion can present with developmental and language delay, neurobehavioral disturbances and psychiatric problems. Autism, seizures, schizophrenia and mild dysmorphic features are less commonly seen. The 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 microdeletion involving four genes (i.e., TUBGCP5, CYFIP1, NIPA1, NIPA2) is emerging as a recognized syndrome with a prevalence ranging from 0.57%-1.27% of patients presenting for microarray analysis which is a two to four fold increase compared with controls. Review of clinical features from about 200 individuals were grouped into five categories and included developmental (73%) and speech (67%) delays; dysmorphic ears (46%) and palatal anomalies (46%); writing (60%) and reading (57%) difficulties, memory problems (60%) and verbal IQ scores ≤75 (50%); general behavioral problems, unspecified (55%) and abnormal brain imaging (43%). Other clinical features noted but not considered as common were seizures/epilepsy (26%), autism spectrum disorder (27%), attention deficit disorder (ADD)/attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (35%), schizophrenia/paranoid psychosis (20%) and motor delay (42%). Not all individuals with the deletion are clinically affected, yet the collection of findings appear to share biological pathways and presumed genetic mechanisms. Neuropsychiatric and behavior disturbances and mild dysmorphic features are associated with genomic imbalances of the 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 region, including microdeletions, but with an apparent incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity."
25653289,"We provide a nationwide population study of patients with congenital muscular dystrophy in Italy.Cases were ascertained from the databases in all the tertiary referral centers for pediatric neuromuscular disorders and from all the genetic diagnostic centers in which diagnostic tests for these forms are performed.The study includes 336 patients with a point prevalence of 0.563 per 100,000. Mutations were identified in 220 of the 336 (65.5%). The cohort was subdivided into diagnostic categories based on the most recent classifications on congenital muscular dystrophies. The most common forms were those with α-dystroglycan glycosylation deficiency (40.18%) followed by those with laminin α2 deficiency (24.11%) and collagen VI deficiency (20.24%). The forms of congenital muscular dystrophy related to mutations in SEPN1 and LMNA were less frequent (6.25% and 5.95%, respectively).Our study provides for the first time comprehensive epidemiologic information and point prevalence figures for each of the major diagnostic categories on a large cohort of congenital muscular dystrophies. The study also reflects the diagnostic progress in this field with an accurate classification of the cases according to the most recent gene discoveries."
28877709,"The aim of this study was to assess in amyloidosis prevalence in Korea between 2006 and 2015.Primary diagnoses related to amyloidosis, regardless of subtype, were collected from the Korean National Health Insurance Service from 2006 through 2015.Overall, the age-standardized prevalence of amyloidosis was 0.93 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81, 1.04) persons per 100,000 persons in 2006 and 1.91 (95% CI 1.78, 2.05) persons per 100,000 persons in 2015. This included an increase from 0.43 (95% CI 0.35, 0.51) to 1.04 (95% CI 0.94, 1.14) persons per 100,000 persons in men and from 0.49 (95% CI 0.40, 0.57) to 0.87 (95% CI 0.77, 0.96) persons per 100,000 persons in women. In particular, the age-standardized prevalence of amyloidosis showed a greater increase in patients aged 65 years or older and in patients aged 45-64 years than in patients aged 20-44 years, for both men and women.The overall age-standardized prevalence of amyloidosis was approximately 2 persons per 100,000 persons in 2015. The overall age-standardized prevalence of amyloidosis increased between 2006 and 2015, especially in individuals aged 45-64 and older than 65 years."
21385546,"To evaluate the annual incidence of Takayasu's arteritis (TA) in eastern Denmark and to describe the clinical course of Danish TA patients.All patients living in the eastern part of Denmark and registered with a first-time hospital discharge diagnosis of TA between 1990 and 2009 were identified. The TA diagnoses of the identified patients were confirmed by medical records review.A total of 19 TA patients (3 males and 16 females) were included in the study. Two patients were of Asian origin, while 17 were Caucasians. The median patient age at the time of the TA diagnosis was 36 years (range: 19-66 years), and the median time interval between the onset of symptoms attributable to TA and the diagnosis of the disease was 11 months (range: 1-50 months). The estimated mean annual incidence of TA was 0.4 (95% CI: 0.25-0.62) per million. No deaths occurred during a median follow-up period of 11.5 years (range: 0.5-19.5 years). Eleven patients (58%) experienced one or more serious vascular events due to TA. Among these, eight patients developed their vascular complications before the vasculitis diagnosis was established.In the current cohort, serious vascular events affected a large proportion of patients before the TA diagnosis was made or during follow-up. The incidence of TA in Denmark seems to be comparable to the incidence in other regions of Europe."
17553227,"We analyzed databases spanning 50 years, which included retrospective alveolar echinococcosis (AE) case finding studies and databases of the 3 major centers for treatment of AE in Switzerland. A total of 494 cases were recorded. Annual incidence of AE per 100,000 population increased from 0.12-0.15 during 1956-1992 and a mean of 0.10 during 1993-2000 to a mean of 0.26 during 2001-2005. Because the clinical stage of the disease did not change between observation periods, this increase cannot be explained by improved diagnosis. Swiss hunting statistics suggested that the fox population increased 4-fold from 1980 through 1995 and has persisted at these higher levels. Because the period between infection and development of clinical disease is long, the increase in the fox population and high Echinococcus multilocularis prevalence rates in foxes in rural and urban areas may have resulted in an emerging epidemic of AE 10-15 years later."
27494824,"Large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia is a lymphoproliferative disorder of cytotoxic cells. T-cell LGL (T-LGL) leukemia is characterized by accumulation of cytotoxic T cells in blood and infiltration of the bone marrow, liver or spleen. Population-based studies have not been reported in LGL leukemia. We present clinical characteristics, natural history and risk factors for poor survival in patients with LGL leukemia using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER) and the United States National Cancer Data Base (NCDB). LGL leukemia is an extremely rare disease with the incidence of 0.2 cases per 1 000 000 individuals. The median age at diagnosis was 66.5 years with females likely to be diagnosed at 3 years earlier compared with males. Analysis of patient-level data using NCDB (n=978) showed that 45% patients with T-LGL leukemia required some form of systemic treatment at the time of diagnosis. T-LGL leukemia patients have reduced survival compared with general population, with a median overall survival of 9 years. Multivariate analysis showed that age >60 years at the time of diagnosis and the presence of significant comorbidities were independent predictors of poor survival."
2996415,"Brachial plexus neuropathy (BPN) is a clinical entity of unknown cause characterized by the acute or subacute onset of pain and weakness, with occasional atrophy of the arm muscles. Information on the incidence of the disease in a delineated population is lacking, as the data available on BPN have come essentially from case reports or selected series. Using the Mayo Clinic records-linkage system as the source of data, 579 clinical records were reviewed of Rochester, Minnesota, residents in which a diagnosis suggestive of BPN was reported for the period 1970 through 1981. Eleven cases fulfilled all criteria, providing an overall annual incidence rate of 1.64 cases per 100,000 population. An infectious disease and/or tetanus toxoid immunization preceded the onset of BPN in 4 cases. The upper brachial plexus was involved in 6 cases, the lower brachial plexus in 2, and the whole plexus in 3; in 1 case there was bilateral BPN. The neuropathy ran a mild to moderate course in 10 cases, and complete recovery was recorded in 6, with slight residua in the others. The occurrence of antecedent events and the features of the disease are supportive of the concept of an immune-mediated process."
23196468,"The diagnosis of multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) is often missed because MMN disguises itself as a motor neuron disease and is considered relatively rare. Detailed epidemiological studies of MMN have not been undertaken. We therefore conducted a nationwide survey of MMN in comparison with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). This retrospective study examined 47 patients with MMN and 1,051 patients with ALS from major neuromuscular centers in Japan from 2005 to 2009. MMN had a younger age of onset and was more common in males than ALS. The ratio of MMN to ALS patients (0-0.10) varied among the centers, but mostly converged to 0.05. The prevalence was estimated to be 0.3 cases for MMN and 6.63 cases for ALS per 100,000 persons. Twenty-five MMN patients (54.2%) showed conduction block. Thirty-four (75%) of 45 MMN patients received intravenous immunoglobulin exhibited a favorable outcome. It is expected that more sensitive indicators of conduction block or focal demyelinating lesions than currently available MMN diagnostic criteria would further increase the ratio of MMN to ALS patients and the total number of MMN patients who can benefit from treatment. MMN is by no means a rare disorder but should be accurately diagnosed in all neuromuscular centers."
2766509,"Using the records linkage system of the Mayo Clinic and of the Rochester Epidemiology Project, which accesses diagnostic data on the entire population of Olmsted County, Minnesota, we identified 45 new cases of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and 19 new cases of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) among county residents for the years 1975-1984. Overall age- and sex-adjusted incidence rates were 6.0/100,000 and 2.5/100,000 person-years, respectively. The incidence of DCM doubled from 3.9/100,000 in the first 5 years to 7.9/100,000 person-years in the last 5 years of study. The corresponding change for HCM was from 1.4 to 3.6/100,000 person-years. Age- and sex-adjusted prevalence rates as of January 1, 1985, for DCM and HCM were 36.5/100,000 and 19.7/100,000 population, respectively. The prevalence of DCM in persons less than 55 years old was 17.9/100,000, over a third of whom were New York Heart Association functional Class III or IV at diagnosis. These estimates may be of value in determining the potential use of health care resources, particularly cardiac transplantation."
16007635,"There is a paucity of epidemiologic information about the eye malformations anophthalmia and microphthalmia. Using data from a large population-based registry, we explored prevalences and maternal/infant characteristics associated with anophthalmia and bilateral microphthalmia. Data were derived from the California Birth Defects Monitoring Program, a population-based active surveillance system for collecting information on infants and fetuses with congenital malformations using multiple source ascertainment. Approximately 2.5 million births (liveborn and stillborn) occurred during the ascertainment period, 1989-1997. Information on maternal and infant/fetal characteristics was obtained from California birth certificate and fetal death files. The prevalence per 10,000 livebirths and stillbirths for anophthalmia was 0.18 and for bilateral microphthalmia was 0.22. These estimates reflect prevalences among births without chromosomal anomalies. Relative risks of anophthalmia were modestly higher among women aged 40 or more (relative risk = 2.0, 95% confidence interval 0.5-8.6). Risks were substantially lower for those mothers with >12 years of education, even after adjusting for other study factors, relative risk = 0.6 (0.2-1.7). The risk of anophthalmia was approximately twofold among multiple births compared to singletons. Similar to results for anophthalmia, decreased risks for bilateral microphthalmia were observed for maternal education of 12 years or more and increased risks observed for multiple births. These data show descriptive epidemiologic features of anophthalmia and bilateral microphthalmia."
27912864,"Scorpion stings are registered worldwide, but the incidence and the features of the envenomations vary depending on the region. The aim of this review was to summarize the epidemiological, clinical, diagnostic, and therapeutic data worldwide regarding humans stung by scorpions.A systematic review of the literature was conducted through the online databases of the Virtual Health Library (VHL), which hosts Medline and the Latin American and Caribbean Center on Health Sciences Informational (LILACS) database. We selected articles published between January 1, 2002 and July 31, 2014.Scorpion envenomation reports were found throughout the world, mainly in subtropical and tropical regions. The clinical manifestations were sympathetically and parasympathetically mediated, depending on the species of scorpion. Some of the most common severe complications of scorpionism included respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonary edema, cardiac dysfunction, impaired hemostasis, pancreatitis, and multiple organ failure. Scorpion envenomation could be classified as mild, moderate, and severe, and the therapeutic approach was based on the case severity. The treatment comprised 3 components: symptomatic measures, vital functions support, and injection of antivenom. Moreover, the time that elapsed between the sting and administration of the appropriate medical care was extremely important to the patient's prognosis.The large number of scorpion stings worldwide is concerning and reaffirms the need for new prevention measures and policies to reduce the incidence, prevalence, morbidity, and mortality rates from these poisonous arachnids."
11487180,"Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a rare form of parkinsonism. The incidence rates are about 0.3-1.1 cases per 100,000 persons. The only two case-control studies performed up to now show conflictual results as regards education and residence in rural areas. Recently, a cluster of PSP and atypical parkinsonism has been observed in French Antilles. The hypothesis is that a consumption of both tropical fruit and herbal tea may be associated with PSP onset. Some PSP families with a probably autosomal dominant transmission have been described. A high frequency of a tau haplotype (H1/H1) associated with PSP is reported by some authors. The significance of this association is still not clear. We have performed a case-control study on 58 PSP cases, 116 hospital controls and 58 population controls."
22542437,"Medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD) is the most common defect of fatty acid oxidation. Many countries have introduced newborn screening for MCADD, because characteristic acylcarnitines can easily be identified in filter paper blood spot samples by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), because MCADD is a frequent disease, and because of the success of early treatment initiated before clinical symptoms have emerged. In Denmark we have screened 519,350 newborns for MCADD by MS/MS and identified 58 affected babies. The diagnosis of MCADD was confirmed in all 58 newborns by mutation analysis. This gives an incidence of MCADD detected by newborn screening in Denmark of 1/8954. In sharp contrast to this we found that the incidence of clinically presenting MCADD in Denmark in the 10 year period preceding introduction of MS/MS-based screening was only 1 in 39,691. This means that four times more newborns with MCADD are detected by screening than what is expected based on the number of children presenting clinically in an unscreened population. The mutation spectrum in the newborns detected by screening is different from that observed in clinically presenting patients with a much lower proportion of newborns being homozygous for the prevalent disease-causing c.985A>G mutation. A significant number of the newborns have genotypes with mutations that have not been observed in patients detected clinically. Some of these mutations, like c.199T>C and c.127G>A, are always associated with a milder biochemical phenotype and may cause a milder form of MCADD with a relatively low risk of disease manifestation, thereby explaining part of the discrepancy between the frequency of clinically manifested MCADD and the frequency of MCADD determined by screening. In addition, our data suggest that some of this discrepancy can be explained by a reduced penetrance of the c.985A>G mutation, with perhaps only 50% of c.985A>G homozygotes presenting with disease manifestations. Interestingly, we also report that the observed number of newborns identified by screening who are homozygous for the c.985A>G mutation is twice that predicted from the estimated carrier frequency. We therefore redetermined the carrier frequency in a new sample of 1946 blood spots using a new assay, but this only confirmed that the c.985A>G carrier frequency in Denmark is approximately 1/105. We conclude that MCADD is much more frequent than expected, has a reduced penetrance and that rapid genotyping using the initial blood spot sample is important for correct diagnosis and counseling."
11841374,"BACKGROUND:Darier's disease has a world-wide distribution, but estimates of prevalence have varied. The discovery that the disease is due to mutations in ATP2A2 provides the opportunity to study the genetic epidemiology of the disease in localized populations. OBJECTIVES:To survey the prevalence of Darier's disease in the west of Scotland and look for founder effects in this population. METHODS:We ascertained cases of Darier's disease in the west of Scotland and used genealogy and mutational analysis to seek common ancestry. RESULTS:Seventy-eight current cases were identified, giving a prevalence of approximately 1 : 30 000. While 63 cases gave a history of Darier's disease in previous generations, conventional genealogy identified only two pairs of two family groups with common ancestry within the last 180 years. Eleven patients (14%; three of whom had in total four affected children) had probable de novo mutations. Causative mutations in ATP2A2 have been identified in 11 of 15 pedigrees screened for mutation, but no two share the same mutation. CONCLUSIONS:High estimates of prevalence are likely to be due to intensive ascertainment, rather than founder effects. Darier's disease is likely to be more common than has been recognized in other populations."
17524597,"BACKGROUND: Pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP) is a rare disease with an estimated incidence of 1 per million per year, and is thought to originate usually from an appendiceal mucinous epithelial neoplasm. However it is not known exactly how often these neoplasms lead to PMP. The aim of this study is to investigate the incidence of both lesions and their relation. METHODS: The nationwide pathology database of the Netherlands (PALGA) was searched for the incidence of all appendectomies, the incidence of primary epithelial appendiceal lesions and the incidence and pathology history of patients with PMP. All regarded the 10-year period of 1995-2005. RESULTS: In the 10-year period 167,744 appendectomies were performed in the Netherlands. An appendiceal lesion was found in 1482 appendiceal specimens (0.9%). Nine percent of these patients developed PMP. Coincidentally, an additional epithelial colonic neoplasm was found in 13% of patients with an appendiceal epithelial lesion. A mucinous epithelial neoplasm was identified in 0.3% (73% benign, 27% malignant) of appendiceal specimens and 20% of these patients developed PMP. For mucocele and non-mucinous neoplasm the association with PMP was only 2% and 3%, respectively. From the nationwide database 267 patients (62 men and 205 women) with PMP were identified, which demonstrates an incidence of PMP in the Netherlands approaching 2 per million per year. The primary site was identified in 68% and dominated by the appendix (82%). CONCLUSIONS: Primary epithelial lesions of the appendix are rare. One third of these lesions are mucinous epithelial neoplasms and especially these tumours may progress into PMP. The incidence of PMP seems to be higher than thought before. Furthermore there is a considerable risk of an additional colonic epithelial neoplasm in patients with an epithelial neoplasm at appendectomy."
28283361,"Studies investigating the epidemiology and mortality of Takayasu Arteritis (TA) are scarce. The objective of this study was to provide information regarding the epidemiology of TA, such as the incidence, prevalence, survival and cause of death in Korea.We used a national, population-based database maintained by the Rare Intractable Disease registration program and the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service, which includes information on all TA patients, diagnosed based on uniform criteria. We also used data from Statistics Korea linked with RID database to confirm survival and cause of death. We analyzed data for the period 2008-2012.During study period, there were 612 new patients with TA, with a female-to-male ratio of 4.3:1. The annual mean incidence was 0.24 per 105 people, and the prevalence was 2.82 per 105 people in 2012. The average annual mortality rate was 0.02 per 105 people, and the standardized mortality ratio was 3.1. The overall survival of patients with TA was 96.6%, which was significantly lower than that in the general population. Cardiovascular disease was the most common cause of death, accounting for 29 of the 64 deaths (45.3%), followed by neoplasms in 9 patients (14.1%).The incidence and prevalence presented in this study are the highest ever reported. The survival of patients with TA was significantly lower than that of the general population, and the main cause of death was cardiovascular disease. This study reflects the need for greater awareness of TA, especially in Asian countries."
8592622,"Primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1) always leads to oxalate accumulation throughout the body (oxalosis). Currently available epidemiological data only concern patients with end-stage kidney disease requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT). French nephrologists have been questioned about PH1 patients who were under their care between 1988 and 1992. Exhaustive answers were obtained and 90 cases of PH1 were collected. The average prevalence rate of PH1 was 1.05/10(6) and its average incidence rate was 0.12/10(6)/year. The median age at onset was 5 years (0-63) and initial symptoms involved the urinary tract in 82% of the cases. Half the patients were younger than 10 years at the time of diagnosis on the basis of urine oxalate (89%) +/- urine glycolate (43%) +/- plasma oxalate (71%) +/- hepatic alanine:glyoxylate amino-transferase activity (48%). At the time of the survey, 36% of patients were on a conservative treatment, 37% were transplanted and 27% were on maintenance haemodialysis; the crude mortality rate was 19% (median age 36 years). Patients on dialysis started RRT at a median age of 25 years. Transplanted patients received their first transplant at a median age of 29.5 years; among those patients with more than 1 year follow-up, 15 received an isolated kidney transplant (one success), one had a isolated liver transplant (one success) and 10 combined liver-kidney transplant (eight successes). These data confirm the rarity of PH1 together with its poor prognosis; as shown in the European experience, early combined liver-kidney transplantation seems to be the best therapeutic proposal."
3907353,"We present data from the Latin American Collaborative Study of Congenital Malformations (ECLAMC) on prevalence rates and etiologic factor associations in neural tube defects. Two series of data are analyzed: the A series, including 740,139 consecutive infants born in the 1967-1979 period suitable for secular trend analysis and case-control study of risk factors; and the B series, including 255,834 consecutive stillborn and liveborn infants of the 1980-1982 period suitable for prevalence rate analysis. Anencephaly was registered in 6.0/10,000 births, A spina bifida aperta in 6.2/10,000 births, and cephalocele in 2.4/10,000 births. A stable secular trend was observed for the frequency of all three neural tube defect types. Spina bifida was more frequent in Chile than in the rest of South America. No differences in prevalence rates were seen between tropical and non tropical areas. Parental consanguinity and environmental prenatal factors including maternal illnesses, drug intake, and radiation exposure were found in association with anencephaly and spina bifida."
19620191,"OBJECTIVE: Tandem mass spectrometry is widely applied to routine newborn screening but there are no long-term studies of outcome. We studied the clinical outcome at six years of age in Australia. METHODS: In a cohort study, we analyzed the outcome at 6 years for patients detected by screening or by clinical diagnosis among >2 million infants born from 1994 to 1998 (1,017,800, all unscreened) and 1998 to 2002 (461,500 screened, 533,400 unscreened) recording intellectual and physical condition, school placement, other medical problems, growth, treatment, diet, and hospital admissions. Results were analyzed separately for medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD) and other disorders, and grouped patients as those who presented clinically or died in the first 5 days of life; patients presented later or diagnosed by screening, and those with substantially benign disorders. RESULTS: Inborn errors, excluding phenylketonuria, were diagnosed in 116 of 1,551,200 unscreened infants (7.5/100,000 births) and 70 of 461,500 screened infants (15.2/100,000 births). Excluding MCADD, 21 unscreened patients with metabolic disorders diagnosed after 5 days of life died or had a significant intellectual or physical handicap (1.35/100,000 population) compared with 2 of the screened cohort (0.43/100,000; odds ratio: 3.1 [95% CI: 0.73-13.32]). Considering the likely morbidity or mortality among the expected number of never-diagnosed unscreened patients, there would be a significant difference. Growth distribution was normal in all cohorts. CONCLUSION: Screening by tandem mass spectrometry provides a better outcome for patients at 6 years of age, with fewer deaths and fewer clinically significant disabilities."
22012125,"BACKGROUND: Primary eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders, a spectrum of inflammatory conditions, occurs when eosinophils selectively infiltrate the gut in the absence of known causes for such tissue eosinophilia. These may be classified into eosinophilic esophagitis, eosinophilic gastroenteritis and eosinophilic colitis (EC). This review focuses on EC: its pathogenesis, epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis and current approach to treatment. SOURCES OF DATA: A literature review published in English was performed using Pubmed, Ovid, Google scholar search engines with the following keywords: eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorder, EC, eosinophils, colitis and gastrointestinal. AREAS OF AGREEMENT: The basis for primary EC appears related to increased sensitivity to allergens, principally as a food allergy in infants and a T lymphocyte-mediated event in adults. Endoscopic changes are generally modest, featuring edema and patchy granularity. AREAS OF CONTROVERSY: Clear clinical and pathological diagnostic criteria of EC and its management strategy. GROWING POINTS: Intestinal involvement of EC is primarily mucosal, presenting as a mild self-limited proctitis in infants and self-limited colitis in young adults. Therapeutic approaches based on case reports tend to use either elimination diets to avoid a presumed allergen; agents traditionally used in inflammatory disease or targeted drugs like anti-histamines or leukotriene receptor antagonists. AREAS TIMELY FOR DEVELOPING RESEARCH: Prospective randomized controlled trials addressing the disease natural history, possible preventive methods and effective medical approach and long-term prognosis are required."
19818453,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of major congenital heart defects (CHD) by ethnicity and sex. STUDY DESIGN: Data from the Florida Birth Defects Registry was used to conduct a retrospective cohort study with 8029 singleton infants with 11 CHDs born 1998-2003 to resident non-Hispanic (NH) white, NH-black, and Hispanic women aged 15 to 49. Defect-specific prevalence rates, ratios, and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Poisson regression was used to calculate adjusted ethnic-specific rate ratios (RR) for each CHD. Statistical significance was P < .0001. RESULTS: Compared with NH-whites, NH-black males had significantly increased rates of pulmonary valve atresia/stenosis (RR = 1.66) but lower prevalence of aortic valve atresia/stenosis (RR = 0.33) and ventricular septal defect (VSD; RR = 0.78). Hispanic males had lower rates of aortic valve atresia/stenosis (RR = 0.28), coarctation of the aorta (RR = 0.61) and VSD (RR = 0.79). NH-black females had statistically significantly lower rates of VSD (RR = 0.75), and Hispanic females had lower rates of tetralogy of Fallot (RR = 0.54), VSD (RR = 0.84) and atrioventricular septal defects (RR = 0.53) compared with NH-whites. CONCLUSIONS: We found differences in ethnic susceptibilities to CHD by sex, but the cause remains unclear."
21231797,"OBJECTIVE: Primary Sjögren's syndrome (PSS) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease characterized by exocrine gland inflammation producing clinical symptoms such as dryness of the mouth and eyes. The reported prevalence of PSS is variable, probably because of different classification criteria used and selection bias. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of PSS in a well-defined Norwegian Caucasian population using the revised American-European Consensus Group (AECG) criteria. METHODS: Three hospitals and three private rheumatology practices provide all of the rheumatology services to the local population in Hordaland and Rogaland counties, which included 852 342 Caucasian inhabitants as of 1 January 2009. Patients on file fulfilling the new revised AECG criteria for PSS were included, and patients with incomplete data were invited to a screening visit. RESULTS: A total of 424 PSS patients were identified. Their mean age was 61.6 ± 13.2 years; 28 (7%) were men and 396 (93%) were women. The point estimate for the proportion of PSS was 0.050% [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.048-0.052]. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of PSS in this Norwegian population of Caucasians is lower than previously reported when less stringent criteria for identifying PSS were used, but is in line with more recent studies using the same criteria and methods as in this study."
16264243,"OBJECTIVE: Epidemiologic studies of Myotonic Dystrophy (Dystrophic Myotony, DM) have shown variable regional prevalence from 0,46 to 189/105. We carried out a total population survey of DM in Iceland in 2004 having Oct. 31 as the day of prevalence. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients were collected from multiple sources, including Landspitali University Hospital registry and through contact with neurologists, neuropaediatricians, paediatricians and rehabilitation specialists. All EMGs of DM patients were reviewed. Information was gathered about age, age of onset, family history of DM and clinical symptoms. RESULTS: Eighty-two patients were ascertained giving a crude prevalence of 28.2/105. The prevalence of the congenital form of DM was 7.9/105 (23 patients, 26%). Affected females outnumbered males with a gender ratio of 1.2:1 (NS). Mean age of onset of symptoms for those, who didn't have the congenital form was 27.5 years (range 5-70 years). Ten families with DM were identified and all prevalent patients belonged to those families. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of DM is high in Iceland and higher than generally reported. This study showed a three times higher total prevalence and a seven times higher prevalence of congenital DM than found in a previous study in Iceland. We believe that this increase in prevalence probably reflects increased awareness of inherited diseases in neonates and better detection of patients who have mild symptoms."
19347027,"Friedreich ataxia is the most frequent hereditary ataxia, with an estimated prevalence of 3-4 cases per 100,000 individuals. This autosomal-recessive neurodegenerative disease is characterized by progressive gait and limb ataxia, dysarthria, lower-limb areflexia, decreased vibration sense, muscular weakness in the legs, and a positive extensor plantar response. Non-neurological signs include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and diabetes mellitus. Symptom onset typically occurs around puberty, and life expectancy is 40-50 years. Friedreich ataxia is usually caused by a large GAA-triplet-repeat expansion within the first intron of the frataxin (FXN) gene. FXN mutations cause deficiencies of the iron-sulfur cluster-containing subunits of the mitochondrial electron transport complexes I, II, and III, and of the iron-sulfur protein aconitase. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been addressed in several open-label, non-placebo-controlled trials, which indicated that treatment with idebenone might ameliorate hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; a well-designed phase II trial suggested concentration-dependent functional improvements in non-wheelchair-bound children and adolescents. Other current experimental approaches address iron-mediated toxicity, or aim to increase FXN expression through the use of erythropoietin and histone deacetylase inhibitors. This Review provides guidelines, from a European perspective, for the diagnosis of Friedreich ataxia, differential diagnosis of ataxias and genetic counseling, and treatment of neurological and non-neurological symptoms."
19345567,"INTRODUCTION: Few data are available on the epidemiology of interstitial lung diseases (ILDs), especially after the current classification of idiopathic interstitial pneumonias. The aim of this study is to provide data on the epidemiology of ILDs in Greece, under the ATS/ERS international consensus. METHODS: Departments of Pneumonology were contacted and asked to complete a questionnaire for every case of ILD that was alive on 2004 as well as for every new case from 1st January 2004 to 31st December 2004. Questions on the patients' demographic data, the exact diagnosis and the procedures used to establish the diagnosis were included. Centers covering about 60% of the Greek population have been analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 967 cases have been registered. The estimated prevalence of ILDs is 17.3 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. The estimated annual incidence of ILDs is 4.63 new cases per 100,000 inhabitants. The most frequent disease is sarcoidosis (34.1%), followed in decreasing order by idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (19.5%), ILD associated with collagen vascular diseases (12.4%), cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (5.3%), histiocytosis (3.8%), and hypersensitivity pneumonitis (2.6%). Unclassified ILD or not otherwise specified accounted for the 8.5% of prevalent cases. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that sarcoidosis and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis are the most frequent ILDs in our population. In comparison with the few previous reports, interesting dissimilarities have been observed."
8215542,"Ascertainment of cases of classical galactosaemia over a three year period in the UK and the Republic of Ireland, through the British Paediatric Surveillance Unit, identified 58 proved cases and two in whom the diagnosis was strongly suspected. One patient died at 4 days, and severe morbidity was no more frequent in babies diagnosed clinically because of their symptoms compared with those who were screened for galactosaemia. Treatment of four babies in the non-screened group was delayed until after 5 weeks of age, but it is concluded that all cases of galactosaemia could be diagnosed in an acceptable time without screening, providing clinical vigilance is maintained."
12692062,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS:The Danish Polyposis Register was established in 1971 with the aim of improving the poor prognosis of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), and in 1975 the register became national. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the prevalence of colorectal cancer and survival rate in FAP patients before and after the establishment of the Danish Polyposis Register. PATIENTS AND METHODS:The Danish Polyposis Register was established by collecting information on probands and construction of their pedigrees. Family members at risk were offered prophylactic endoscopic and molecular genetic examination, and affected individuals were treated by colectomy. RESULTS:At the end of 2001, the Danish Polyposis Register included 434 patients from 165 families. The incidence rate was 1.90x10(-6) and the prevalence rate 4.65x10(-5). Colorectal cancer on the basis of FAP constituted 0.07% of all colorectal cancers in the 1990s. Colorectal cancer was diagnosed in 170/252 probands (67%) and in 5/182 call-up patients (3%) (p<0.001). The cumulative crude survival was 94% in call-up patients compared with 44% in probands (p<0.0001). A comparison of two periods, 1900-1975 and 1976-2001, demonstrated a decreased prevalence of colorectal cancer from 60% to 27% (p<0.0001), and an increased use of colectomy from 52% to 93% (p<0.00001). The cumulative crude survival in FAP showed substantial improvement with time (p<0.00001). CONCLUSION:Since the establishment of the Danish Polyposis Register, the prevalence of colorectal cancer has decreased considerably and the prognosis has improved substantially. The work of the Danish Polyposis Register is probably the main cause of this improvement."
22312171,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficiency of the French national screening program for 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21-OHD). Neonatal screening for congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-OHD is mainly intended to prevent death due to salt wasting but remains controversial because of the number of false-positive results and the ease with which most female cases can be identified by virilized genitalia at birth. DESIGN: Population-based study. SETTING: National neonatal screening program, pediatric endocrinologists nationwide, and reference center for genotyping. PARTICIPANTS: All neonates screened for 21-OHD in mainland France between January 1, 1996, and December 31, 2003. OUTCOME MEASURES: Screening efficiency indicators, disease severity, contribution of screening to early diagnosis, and disease-specific mortality before and during the study period. RESULTS: A total of 6,012,798 neonates were screened; results in 15,407 were considered positive for 21-OHD. Three hundred eighty-three cases were identified, giving a prevalence of 1 for every 15,699 births. The positive predictive value of screening was 2.3% (95% CI, 2.1%-2.6%), with a sensitivity of 93.5% (90.9%-95.9%) and a specificity of 99.7% (99.7%-99.7%). The false-positive rate was particularly high in preterm infants, for which the positive predictive value was 0.4% (95% CI, 0.2%-0.5%). Screening allowed clinical diagnosis in 162 of 383 cases (42.3%), with the others being detected clinically or through family history. There was a trend toward declining neonatal mortality due to 21-OHD. CONCLUSIONS: In this large population-based study, the efficiency of routine 21-OHD screening was moderate in neonates born at term and very low in preterm neonates. We recommend the discontinuation of screening, as currently performed in France, in preterm neonates."
26816302,"Alsace is a region in eastern France with a population of ∼2 million. All residents have high access to health care and an accredited referral center for SSc. Seeking care outside of this region is difficult because of the peculiar geography. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence and spatial variation of systemic sclerosis (SSc) in eastern France.Data for SSc patients were obtained from 3 sources (all general practitioners and community specialists, capillaroscopy centers, and all public and private hospital records) and were used to estimate the prevalence of SSc. Surviving patients who resided in Alsace on January 1, 2008 and fulfilled the American College of Rheumatology and/or the LeRoy and Medsger criteria were included in this study. The clinical characteristics of the patients were also assessed. Potentially incomplete case ascertainment was corrected by capture-recapture analyses. Geographic disparities were assessed by spatial cluster analysis and by comparing our results with those for other geographic areas in the world for which data derived using similar methodology were available.The review of 499 potential cases identified a total of 244 SSc patients. A trend toward a west-to-east gradient was observed but did not reach statistical significance. According to log-linear modeling, an estimated 83.87 additional cases were missed. Thus, the SSc prevalence was 228.42 cases per million adult inhabitants of Alsace (95% confidence interval 203.70-253.14); this prevalence was significantly higher than that in 2 other regions of France and comparable with the reported prevalence in Detroit, Michigan.The stringent methodology used in the current study is very likely to provide an accurate estimation of the prevalence of SSc. Design similarity with 3 other surveys extends the scope of the results by identifying geographic disparities that were previously indistinguishable due to methodologic differences."
26787776,"Nephrolithiasis is a prevalent condition that affects 10%-15% of adults in their lifetime. It is associated with high morbidity due to colicky pain, the necessity for surgical intervention, and sometimes progression to CKD. In recent years, multiple monogenic causes of nephrolithiasis and nephrocalcinosis have been identified. However, the prevalence of each monogenic gene in a pediatric renal stone cohort has not yet been extensively studied.To determine the percentage of cases that can be explained molecularly by mutations in one of 30 known nephrolithiasis/nephrocalcinosis genes, we conducted a high-throughput exon sequencing analysis in an international cohort of 143 individuals <18 years of age, with nephrolithiasis (n=123) or isolated nephrocalcinosis (n=20). Over 7 months, all eligible individuals at three renal stone clinics in the United States and Europe were approached for study participation.We detected likely causative mutations in 14 of 30 analyzed genes, leading to a molecular diagnosis in 16.8% (24 of 143) of affected individuals; 12 of the 27 detected mutations were not previously described as disease causing (44.4%). We observed that in our cohort all individuals with infantile manifestation of nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis had causative mutations in recessive rather than dominant monogenic genes. In individuals who manifested later in life, causative mutations in dominant genes were more frequent.We present the first exclusively pediatric cohort examined for monogenic causes of nephrolithiasis/nephrocalcinosis, and suggest that important therapeutic and preventative measures may result from mutational analysis in individuals with early manifestation of nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis."
1390140,"The prevalence, pattern of inheritance, and phenotype of Darier's disease was examined in a cross-sectional study of cases in north-east England. Seventy-five cases, representing a local prevalence of at least 1:36,000, were identified and examined. Forty-two cases were known to dermatologists, and 33 were identified in the course of the study: 60 were adults (above the age of 20) and 15 were children. In nine families, 66 of 136 adults with an affected parent were known to be affected, indicating complete penetrance of an autosomal dominant gene. eighteen individuals gave no family history, but seven of these were found to be members of affected kindreds and five obligate carriers examined all proved to have evidence of the disease. In other 'new' cases, including several whose parents were examined and confirmed to be normal, no relationship to other cases was found. These cases probably represent new mutations or non-paternity rather than incomplete penetrance. All but one adult case had the typical rash, but it was milder in women; 16/18 adults who had not presented to dermatologists were female. Diagnostic nail lesions were found in 59 (99%), palmar pits and keratoses in 57 (95%), and acrokeratosis verruciformis in 44 (73%). In 15 young cases (aged 5-18) with one or more diagnostic features, the rash was found in only four (27%), nail lesions in nine (60%), palmar pits in eight (53%), and acrokeratoses in ten (67%). The minor lesions were often subtle but were more consistent early evidence of disease than the rash, and even in the absence of a rash gene penetrance may be complete by the age of 10."
2786160,"A total of 186 cases of motor neuron disease (MND) was identified in two Danish counties during the period 1974-1986. The average annual incidence rate was 1.4/100,000 population, and the male:female ratio of incidence rates was 1.5. Mean age at diagnosis was 64.3 +/- 10.0 years. The incidence rates increased significantly with advancing age and reached a maximum at age 60-79 years, followed by a nonsignificant decrease. The average point prevalence was 3.1/100,000 population. Bulbar symptoms were part of the initial symptoms in 65% of cases, and patients with bulbar onset were older than patients with spinal onset. Age- and sex-specific incidence rates indicated a marked male preponderance amongst the youngest patients, in contrast to a female preponderance in patients above 60 years with bulbar onset of MND. Familial MND accounted for 2.7% of cases."
1745328,"We studied the prevalence of various types of progressive muscular dystrophy (PMD) in Okinawa, Japan on December 31, 1989 and the incidence of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) in 5-year periods from 1957 to 1985. We classified patients with PMD clinically, electrophysiologically, molecular biologically and immunohistochemically with antidystrophin antibody, especially for sporadic cases of DMD, Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) and limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LG). The prevalence for all PMD in Okinawa was 7.13 X 10(-5) for DMD, 1.82 X 10(-5) for BMD in the male population, 1.55 X 10(-5) for LG, 1.14 X 10(-5) for congenital muscular dystrophy, 2.03 X 10(-5) for facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSH), and 9.13 X 10(-5) for myotonic dystrophy (MD) in the total population. The incidence of DMD in the period 1957-1985 was 15.41 X 10(-5) live-born males (LBM) and 3.21 X 10(-5) LBM for BMD. The incidence has apparently declined in Okinawa since 1975. The prevalence of BMD, FSH and MD was rather high in Okinawa compared with previous reports. Molecular biological techniques for classifying patients were indispensable for the epidemiological study of PMD."
24294134,"Medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD) is a disorder of fatty acid oxidation characterized by hypoglycemic crisis under fasting or during stress conditions, leading to lethargy, seizures, brain damage, or even death. Biochemical acylcarnitines data obtained through newborn screening by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) were confirmed by molecular analysis of the medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (ACADM) gene. Out of 324.000 newborns screened, we identified 14 MCADD patients, in whom, by molecular analysis, we found a new nonsense c.823G>T (p.Gly275∗) and two new missense mutations: c.253G>C (p.Gly85Arg) and c.356T>A (p.Val119Asp). Bioinformatics predictions based on both phylogenetic conservation and functional/structural software were used to characterize the new identified variants. Our findings confirm the rising incidence of MCADD whose existence is increasingly recognized due to the efficacy of an expanded newborn screening panel by LC-MS/MS making possible early specific therapies that can prevent possible crises in at-risk infants. We noticed that the ""common"" p.Lys329Glu mutation only accounted for 32% of the defective alleles, while, in clinically diagnosed patients, this mutation accounted for 90% of defective alleles. Unclassified variants (UVs or VUSs) are especially critical when considering screening programs. The functional and pathogenic characterization of genetic variants presented here is required to predict their medical consequences in newborns."
8933331,"We studied a large data set from three registries of congenital malformations (central-east France, Sweden, and California), a total of 954 cases, known chromosome anomalies excluded. The prevalence at birth varied significantly between programmes, probably to a large extent because of different ascertainment and inclusion criteria, from 0.76 per 10,000 births in the French programme to 2.35 in the Swedish. Within the California programme, there is a racial variability in prevalence with lower values among whites (and probably blacks) than in Hispanics and Asians. Also the proportion of anotia and microtia varies between races with the lowest proportion of anotia in whites. Anotia and microtia are equally often associated with other malformations and show other similar epidemiological characteristics. In unilateral cases, the right side is more frequently malformed than the left side, especially when the ear malformation is isolated. There is a male excess, most pronounced in isolated forms. Among associated malformations, facial clefts and cardiac defects are the most common ones (each about 30% of infants with associated malformations), followed by anophthalmia or microphthalmia (14%), limb reduction defects or severe renal malformations (11%), and holoprosencephaly (7%). There is a maternal parity effect seen, an increased risk at parity 4+ (standardised for maternal age), more pronounced for anotia than microtia."
21574972,"BACKGROUND: Studies reporting the incidence of isolated cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) are rare. OBJECTIVES: To examine in a population-based cohort study the incidence of CLE and its subsets in Sweden. The short-term probability of receiving an additional diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is also assessed. METHODS: A population-based open cohort study including all patients with CLE [International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code, ICD-10: L93] in Sweden, 2005-2007. Patients (n=1088) were identified in the Swedish National Patient Register. RESULTS: The incidence of CLE was 4·0/100,000; the female/male ratio was 3:1. Mean age at disease onset was 54 years. The most common subset was discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) (80%, n = 868). A quarter of the patients (24%, n=260) were already diagnosed with SLE at the time they were diagnosed with CLE. During the whole observation period (2005-2007), an additional 18% (n = 107) were diagnosed with SLE, the probability of receiving an additional SLE diagnosis being highest for the subacute CLE (SCLE) subset. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first nationwide epidemiological study on CLE. We found the incidence of CLE to be about equal to that of SLE, and found a higher short-term probability for receiving an additional diagnosis with SLE than previously described for CLE. Subsets other than DLE and SCLE were rarely reported in our system; an update of the ICD codes for this diagnostic group could increase reporting of these more unusual cases. Our study clarifies that monitoring and follow-up are called for in this patient group due to the risk for SLE, and underscores the need for clear criteria for risk assessment in the large group of patients with CLE who also fulfil criteria for SLE."
28709457,"Tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis (TINU) syndrome is a rare oculorenal inflammatory condition that was first described in 1975. In 2001 a major review identified 133 cases in the world literature and proposed key diagnostic criteria for the condition. Although acknowledged as rare, the limited data available prevented reliable estimates of the prevalence of the condition, and hampered elucidation of the relationship between genetic and environmental factors that contribute to its pathogenesis.In this review we have performed a systematic search on the epidemiology, demographics and proposed risk factors for TINU. Estimates of prevalence based on studies that explicitly report TINU cases suggest that it is diagnosed in 0.2-2% of patients attending specialist uveitis services, with variation reflecting a number of factors including level of diagnostic certainty required. The prevalence of uveitis in patients with tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) may be higher than currently recognised, particularly in the paediatric population.The prevalence of TINU is higher in younger age groups and there is a female preponderance although this gender effect appears weaker than suggested by early studies. Although important genetic contributions have been proposed, the small size of studies and variation between reports currently preclude identification of a 'pro-TINU' haplotype. Drugs and infections have been proposed as the leading acquired risk factors for the development of TINU; whilst the small size of TINU cohorts and issues of study design limit interpretation of many studies. Larger datasets from the renal literature suggest that the majority of these cases are precipitated by a drug-induced hypersensitivity reaction; however in many ophthalmic cases no clear precipitant is identified."
15978100,"Accurate estimates of the incidence of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) are important to assess the resources required for current treatments as well as to anticipate the need to develop new treatments. Previous estimates have been indirect and have not reported data on patients with ADAMTS-13 deficiency.To determine the incidence of patients with TTP-hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) in three categories: all patients with clinically suspected TTP-HUS, patients with idiopathic TTP-HUS, and patients with severe ADAMTS-13 deficiency.Incidence rates were estimated from the Oklahoma TTP-HUS Registry, analyzing all 206 consecutive patients from January 1, 1996 to June 30, 2004 who were treated with plasma exchange for their initial episode of clinically suspected TTP-HUS. ADAMTS-13 activity was measured in 186 (90%) of the 206 patients.The age-sex-race standardized annual incidence rates were 11.29 x 10(6) (95% CI: 9.70-12.88) for all patients with clinically suspected TTP-HUS; 4.46 x 10(6) (95% CI: 3.43-5.50) for patients with idiopathic TTP-HUS; and 1.74 x 10(6) (95% CI: 1.06-2.41) for patients with severe ADAMTS-13 deficiency (<5% activity). In all three categories, the incidence rates were greater for women and for blacks. For patients with severe ADAMTS-13 deficiency, the age-sex standardized incidence rate ratio of blacks to non-blacks was 9.29 (95% CI: 4.33-19.93).Accurate incidence rate estimates for all patients with clinically suspected TTP-HUS, idiopathic TTP-HUS, and TTP associated with severe ADAMTS-13 deficiency have been determined. The greater incidence among women and blacks is comparable with their increased risk for other autoimmune disorders."
11859691,"PURPOSE:To review epidemiological and clinical aspects of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in Martinique, French West Indies. METHODS:Cases of SLE were identified by attending physicians. Patients who presented with at least four of the criteria defined by the American College of Rheumatology were included. Determination of incidence and prevalence included the new cases arising during the 1990-1999 period and 1999 population census results. Probability of survival was based on the use of the Kaplan-Meier estimator. RESULTS:Two hundred and eighty-six patients were studied, including 265 females (92.7%). The average annual incidence was 4.7 cases per 100,000 inhabitants (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.5-6.9). The prevalence for 1999 was 64.2 cases per 100,000 inhabitants (CI: 56.2-72.2). The mean age at onset was 30 years. Eleven percent of all patients had at least one parent with SLE. Renal disease was present in 139 patients (48.6%), and neurological disorders were diagnosed in 70 patients (24.5%). Patients tested positive for the following antibodies: anti-Sm (37.1%), anti-RNP (58.7%), anti-SSA (47.2%). Mean survival time was: 96.4% (CI: 94.1-98.7) at 5 years, 91.8% (CI: 87.9-95.7) at 10 years. Survival was significantly reduced in patients with end-stage renal disease (n = 40, chi 2 = 6.96, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION:The high incidence of SLE in Martinique and the immunological characteristics of patients were found to be similar to those described in other populations of African descent. The frequency of renal disease and survival rates were identical to those reported in Caucasians."
12072049,"OBJECTIVE:Estimates of the prevalence of Addison's disease in Caucasians have varied from 39 to 117 per million. We have carried out an epidemiological study to obtain a confident point prevalence estimate in the Norwegian population for the end of 1999, and to find out whether the incidence is changing. PATIENTS AND METHODS:The patients were identified by a search through registers of 10 hospitals and consultant endocrinologists serving a population of 916 000. The completeness of the list was tested by a survey of general practitioners in one district, and by the member list of the local Addison Association in another district. RESULTS:We identified 128 patients with Addison's disease (59 men and 69 women), yielding a prevalence of 140 per million. Recorded mean incidence in the past decade was 0.62 per 100,000 per year. Fifty-one patients (40%) had concomitant endocrine diseases. The aetiology was almost exclusively idiopathic or autoimmune. CONCLUSIONS:We found a higher prevalence of Addison's disease in western Norway than has previously been reported anywhere. Our findings support the hypothesis of a rising incidence of autoimmune adrenal insufficiency."
12784291,"In a comprehensive epidemiological survey among Jews living in Israel, the average prevalence of myotonic dystrophy (DM) was 15.7/10(5) (1 case in 6369) with intercommunity variations; the Ashkenazi Jews had the lowest rate, 5.7/10(5) (1 case in 17544) as compared to the rate in the Sephardim/Oriental Jews 20/10(5) (1 case in 5000) and the in the Yemenite Jews 47.3/10(5) (1 case in 2114). The rate of unrelated DM-sibships per 10(6) people of each community was used as an estimate of the transition rate from stable to unstable DMPK-(CTG)(n) alleles assuming that each transition is a beginning of a new DM sibship. This study indicated that the difference in the incidence of DM is a result of higher mutation rate in the non-Ashkenazi Jews (>50/10(6)) as compared to the rate in the Ashkenazi Jews (16.3/10(6)). The intragenic haplotype of the DM alleles was the same as that of the DM in many populations all over the world. However, two DM closely linked markers D19S207 and D19S112 were in linkage disequilibrium with the DM mutation in patients of Yemenite and Moroccan (the largest subgroup in the Sephardim Jews) extractions and not in the Ashkenazi patients. This observation indicated a common ancestral origin for the DM premutation in patients of the same ethnic origin. We concluded that the difference in the prevalence of DM among the Jewish communities is a consequence of founder premutations in the non-Ashkenazi Jewish communities."
24692122,"PURPOSE: We determined the incidence of retinoblastoma and the long-term survival rate of retinoblastoma patients in South Korea. METHODS: We reviewed retrospectively data from the Korea Central Cancer Registry recorded between 1993 and 2010 to identify the incidence of retinoblastoma and the survival rate of retinoblastoma patients in Korea. The incidence of retinoblastoma was estimated by population-based analysis of children aged 0 to 4 years and children aged 0 to 9 years, population-based analysis per live birth, and birth cohort analysis. Survival was analyzed using the Korea Central Cancer Registry database, which was crosschecked with the national death registry. RESULTS: The overall incidence was 11.2 for children aged 0 to 4 years and 5.3 for children aged 0 to 9 years per 1,000,000 person-years, 5.9 per 100,000 live births, and 5.3 per 100,000 live births. Birth cohort analysis showed less variable results in incidence rates over 4 calendar-periods compared to the population-based analyses. The all-cause mortality rate was 7.9% at 5 years and 8.4% at 10 years. The rate improved from 12.5% for patients diagnosed in 1993 to 2000 to 4.5% for those diagnosed in 2001 to 2010. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of retinoblastoma in Korea was found to be similar to that in the United States, Europe, and Asia. The survival rate of retinoblastoma patients in Korea was significantly better during 2001 to 2010 than during 1993 to 2000."
22516048,"Prospective surveillance of Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD) was initiated in Denmark in 1997, following the observation of variant CJD in the United Kingdom. Demographic, clinical and diagnostic information was collected for each patient with clinical suspicion of CJD. Here we describe the methods for surveillance and the observed outcomes between 1 January 1997 and 31 December 2008. A total of 83 patients were classified as sporadic CJD, 47 were definite diagnoses, 34 probable and two possible. This resulted in a mean incidence of 1.26 patients with probable and definite sporadic CJD per million inhabitants. Two sporadic CJD patients were found to have a genetic variant of unknown significance: Thr201Ser and Glu200Asp. One patient was diagnosed with Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker syndrome. No patients were classified as having variant, iatrogenic or familial CJD. The Danish surveillance system, like those in other countries, has a multidisciplinary approach, which is labour-intensive and time-consuming but ensures the most complete set of information possible. With this approach we think that patients with variant CJD would have been detected had they occurred in Denmark. Certain aspects of CJD surveillance need further discussion at European level and beyond, in order to find a balance between efficiency of the systems and accuracy of surveillance data."
21109514,"Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS) consist of a continuum of autoinflammatory diseases caused by a defect in interleukin 1β regulation. Although symptoms may vary widely, the discovery, in 2001, of the gene involved (NLRP3) has dramatically helped diagnosis.To define the spectrum and prevalence of NLRP3 mutations in France and to delineate initial criteria before molecular analysis.Retrospective review (2001-9) of genetic analysis data and request forms of patients living in France with an NLRP3 mutation since the set up of CAPS molecular diagnosis by the three French laboratories providing this test (GenMAI network).Over 800 analyses of this gene have been conducted, identifying 135 cases with an NLRP3 mutation (55 probands; 33 multiplex families); the estimated prevalence in France was equal to 1/360 000. A total of 21 different sequence variants were detected, among which four are common and nine are new mutations.Although the number of NLRP3 test requests has doubled over the past 5 years, genetic screening has not contributed to enhanced detection of new index cases each year. There are two possible reasons for this: (i) no clinical prerequisite for genetic diagnosis and (ii) few new large families are now identified (unlike the initial study based on a selection by linkage). A set of initial clinical criteria have been drawn up which it is recommended should be fulfilled before a patient is tested: at least three recurrent bouts, age at disease onset < 20 years and elevated levels of C-reactive protein, especially in individuals with urticaria and moderate fever."
17372919,"BACKGROUND: Parathyroid cancer is a rare cause of hyperparathyroidism. The objectives of this study were to determine the patterns of disease, treatment trends, and outcomes among patients with parathyroid cancer by using a population-based data source. METHODS: Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) cancer registry data were used to identify patients who were diagnosed with parathyroid cancer from 1988 through 2003. To assess whether the incidence rate, treatment, tumor size, and cancer stage changed over time, the Cochrane-Armitage trend test was used, and Cox proportional-hazards modeling was used to identify the factors associated with an improved overall survival rate. RESULTS: From 1988 through 2003, 224 patients with parathyroid cancer were reported in the SEER data. Over that 16-year study period, the incidence of parathyroid cancer increased by 60% (1988-1991, 3.58 per 10,000,000 population; 2000-2003, 5.73 per 10,000,000 population). Most patients (96%) underwent surgery (parathyroidectomy, 78.6% of patients; en bloc resection, 12.5% of patients; other, 4.9% of patients). The rate of surgical treatment increased significantly during the study period. The 10-year all-cause mortality rate was 33.2%, and the 10-year cancer-related mortality rate was 12.4%. Patient age (P<.0001), sex (P=.0106), the presence of distant metastases at diagnosis (P=.0004), and the year of diagnosis (P=.0287) were associated significantly with the overall survival rate. Tumor size, lymph node status, and type of surgery were not associated significantly with the overall survival rate. CONCLUSIONS: Although parathyroid cancer is rare, the incidence increased significantly in the United States from 1988 through 2003. Young age, female gender, recent year of diagnosis, and absence of distant metastases were associated significantly with an improved survival rate."
19410489,"To describe prevalence, prenatal diagnosis and outcome for fetuses and infants with congenital hydrocephalus.Data were taken from four European registries of congenital malformations (EUROCAT). The registries included are based on multiple sources of information and include information about livebirths, fetal deaths with GA > or = 20 weeks and terminations of pregnancy for fetal anomaly (TOPFA). All cases from the four registries diagnosed with congenital hydrocephalus and born in the period 1996-2003 were included in the study. Cases with hydrocephalus associated with neural tube defects were not included in the study.Eighty-seven cases with congenital hydrocephalus were identified during the study period giving an overall prevalence of 4.65 per 10,000 births. There were 41 livebirths (47%), four fetal deaths (5%) and 42 TOPFA (48%). Nine percent of all cases were from a multiple pregnancy. Additional non-cerebral major malformations were diagnosed in 38 cases (44%) and karyotype anomalies in eight cases (9%). Median GA at TOPFA was 21 weeks. Among livebirths 61% were diagnosed prenatally at a median GA of 31 weeks (range 17-40 weeks) and median GA at birth was 37 weeks. Fourteen liveborn infants (34%) died within the first year of life with the majority of deaths during the first week after birth.Congenital hydrocephalus is a severe congenital malformation often associated with other congenital anomalies. CH is often diagnosed prenatally, although sometimes late in pregnancy. A high proportion of affected pregnancies result in termination for severe fetal anomaly and there is a high mortality in livebirths."
9088385,"OBJECTIVES:We evaluated epidemiology of myotonic dystrophy in Istria, Croatia including direct mutation analysis as an additional, specific diagnostic criterion. MATERIAL AND METHODS:Patients were ascertained in the period 1980-1994 from multiple sources under established clinical criteria with a special reference to congenital and minimal forms of the disease. Additionally, patients and their relatives were evaluated by direct mutation analysis. The prevalence, corrected for underascertainment, was estimated on July 1, 1989. RESULTS:A total of 33 DM patients from nine families were ascertained. In all families the diagnosis was confirmed by mutation analysis of the DM gene. After correction for underascertainment the prevalence of 18.1/100,000 was calculated. CONCLUSION:One of the highest prevalence estimates of DM in the populations without evidence of founder effect or genetic isolation was found. Our results imply the importance of ascertainment of patients with all forms of DM and utilization of specific diagnostic tests for estimation of genetic epidemiology in DM."
20621957,"Despite the contribution of national registries and population-based reports, data concerning the epidemiology of acromegaly is scanty. In addition, the role of the environmental context has not been investigated.Epidemiology of acromegaly was studied in the province of Messina (Sicily, Italy), focusing on the influence of environmental factors.Four zones, characterized by different degrees of exposition to environmental toxins due to industrial pollution, were identified in the province: area A (76,338 inhabitants), area B (287,328 inhabitants), area C (243,381 inhabitants), and area D (47,554 inhabitants) at low, middle-low, middle, and high industrial density respectively. We identified all acromegalics who were born and resided in the province of Messina, among patients either referred to our endocrine unit or referred elsewhere but recorded in the archives of the provincial healthcare agency.In the province of Messina, we found 64 patients (2 in area A, 24 in area B, 28 in area C, and 10 in area D). Macroadenomas were 60%, the male/female ratio was 1, and mean age at diagnosis (±s.e.m.) was 45.4±1.6 years. Overall, prevalence was 97 c.p.m. in the province (26 c.p.m. in area A, 84 c.p.m. in area B, 115 c.p.m. in area C, and 210 c.p.m. in area D). Risk ratio (RR), calculated in every area assuming area A as a reference, showed an increased risk of developing acromegaly in people residing in area D (RR=8.03; P<0.0014).This study confirms the prevalence of acromegaly reported recently. The increased risk of developing this disease in area D suggests that the pathogenetic role of environmental context needs to be better evaluated."
11701258,"Recent advances in diagnostic and therapeutic techniques may have changed incidence and etiologies of West syndrome (WS). We performed a retrospective epidemiological study of WS that occurred in 47 children in Nagasaki Prefecture during a recent 10-year period from 1989 to 1998. The incidence of WS was 3.1/10,000 live births. Thirty-nine patients (83%) had symptomatic WS, in which the prenatal causes were most frequent, followed by low-birth weight (LBW) infants, perinatal and postnatal. Such high frequency of LBW may have been due to a relative increase in survivors of premature babies because of recent advances in perinatal care. The brain computerized tomography/magnetic resonance imaging performed in 41 patients revealed congenital brain malformation (10 patients), destructive brain disorders (13 patients), and no structural abnormalities (18 patients). The seizure outcome was worse in the symptomatic WS than in the cryptogenic WS. The developmental outcome was very poor in both symptomatic and cryptogenic WS. The mean developmental quotient (DQ) in all patients was 25, and only four patients (11%) had a normal DQ (>70). DQ was lower in patients with developmental delay before the onset of WS, symptomatic group, relapse and/or persistence of seizure. Developmental delay seen in WS patients seems to be related to the two major factors, that is, underlying brain abnormalities and the persistent seizures as a result of the former. Therefore, every effort should be made to control seizures, including medical and early surgical treatment, as well as prevention of brain damage through perinatal care."
19016002,"Thyroid hemiagenesis is a rare form of thyroid dysgenesis, in which one thyroid lobe fails to develop. The true prevalence of this rare abnormality is about 0.05-0.2% in normal population. We aimed to determine prevalence of thyroid hemiagenesis in patients with various thyroid disorders and a normal population in a mild to moderate iodine-deficient area. The clinical and thyroid ultrasonography records of 4,833 patients who presented with various thyroid disorders were reviewed. In addition, ultrasonographic data of two large surveys carried out for the community screening of iodine status of children (n = 4,772) and thyroid disorders of adult subjects (n = 2,935) were analyzed. In patients with thyroid disorders, we found 12 cases with thyroid hemiagenesis (0.25%). Thyroid hemiagenesis was due to the agenesis of the left lobe in all cases. The underlying thyroid diseases were Hashimoto's thyroiditis (n = 4), euthyroid multinodular goiter (n = 4), and toxic adenoma (n = 1). Three subjects have no underlying thyroid disease. In ultrasonography screening of normal population, altogether, the absence of the left lobe was detected in only two cases, indicating a true prevalence of thyroid hemiagenesis of 0.025%. None of the reviewed patients had thyroid dysfunction. Our community-based data is in accordance with previous studies in terms of prevalence and male-to-female ratio."
6333203,"Epidemiology is the study of the natural history of disease, which includes its frequency, severity, and course and the identification of ""risk factors"" that influence these aspects. Neuroepidemiology is that branch of epidemiology dealing with disorders that affect the nervous system. Frequency of disease is best measured by population-based rates, which are ratios of the number of cases to the population at risk, expressed as cases per unit of population. Incidence and mortality rates refer, respectively, to new cases of, and deaths caused by, a disease per unit of time and population. Prevalence rate is the cross-sectional count of cases of a disease present at a given time per unit of population. Comparison of rates often requires consideration of age-specific or age-adjusted rates rather than crude rates, all ages. Course of illness (survival, complications, recurrence) can be measured by life-table methods. The annual incidence for disease and injury of the nervous system is about 2.5% (2,500 per 100,000 population) and the prevalence is about 9.5%. Excluding all traumatic, pain, headache, alcohol, psychiatric, and special-sense disorders, neurological diseases have an annual incidence and prevalence rate, respectively, of 1.1 and 3.6% of the population."
7196523,"There have been few population-based studies of acute transverse myelitis (ATM). Therefore, incidence and population selectivity of this disorder in different regions is not well known. Data on all Jewish patients with ATM throughout Israel were collected for the period 1955 through 1975. Based on 62 patients who satisfied rigid diagnostic criteria, the average annual incidence rate was 1.34 per million population. No significant difference in incidence was noted between European/American-born and Afro/Asian-born populations. There was no significant seasonal or annual fluctuation in frequency. In 37% of the patients, a history of infection prior to ATM was reported, more commonly among younger patients. ATM rarely evolved into multiple sclerosis. More than one-third of the patients with ATM made a good recovery; in another one-third recovery was only fair; 14 patients failed to improve and 3 died. If other population-based studies of ATM were undertaken, comparison with our results might shed further light on the causes of this disorder."
19440741,"While Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) and ataxia telangiectasia (AT) are known to be the two most frequent forms of autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia (ARCA), knowledge on the other forms of ARCA has been obtained only recently, and they appear to be rarer. Little is known about the epidemiological features and the relative frequency of the ARCAs and only few data are available about the comparative features of ARCAs. We prospectively studied 102 suspected ARCA cases from Eastern France (including 95 from the Alsace region) between 2002 and 2008. The diagnostic procedure was based on a sequential strategic scheme. We examined the clinical, paraclinical and molecular features of the large cohort of patients and compared features and epidemiology according to molecular diagnosis. A molecular diagnosis could be established for 57 patients; 36 were affected with FRDA, seven with ataxia plus oculomotor apraxia type 2 (AOA2), four with AT, three with ataxia plus oculomotor apraxia type 1 (AOA1), three with Marinesco-Sjögren syndrome, two with autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay (ARSACS), one with ataxia with vitamin E deficiency (AVED) and one with autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia type 2 (ARCA2). The group of patients with no identified mutation had a significantly lower spinocerebellar degeneration functional score corrected for disease duration (SDFS/DD ratio; p = 0.002) and comprised a significantly higher proportion of cases with onset after 20 years (p < 0.01). Extensor plantar reflexes were rarer and cerebellar atrophy was more frequent in the group of patients with a known non-Friedreich ARCA compared to all other patients (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.0003, respectively). Lower limb areflexia and electroneuromyographic evidences of peripheral neuropathy were more frequent in the Friedreich ataxia group than in the group with a known non-Friedreich ataxia and were more frequent in the later group than in the group with no identified mutation (p = 0.0001 and p = 0.01, respectively). The overall prevalence of ARCA in Alsace is 1/19,000. We can infer the prevalence of FRDA in Alsace to be 1/50,000 and infer that AT is approximately eight times less frequent than FRDA. MSS, AOA2 and ARSACS appear only slightly less frequent than AT. Despite the broad variability of severity, Friedreich ataxia patients are clinically distinct from the other forms of ARCA. Patients with no identified mutation have more often a pure cerebellar degenerative disease or a spastic ataxia phenotype. It appears that ARCA cases can be divided into two major groups of different prognosis, an early-onset group with a highly probable genetic cause and an adult-onset group with better prognosis for which a genetic cause is more difficult to prove but not excluded. ARCAs are rare, early-disabling and genetically heterogeneous diseases dominated by FRDA. Several of the recently identified ARCAs, such as AVED, ARSACS, AOA1, AOA2 and MSS, have a prevalence close to AT and should be searched for extensively irrespective of ethnic origins. The strategic scheme is a useful tool for the diagnosis of ARCAs in clinical practice."
6133485,"Occurrence of Takayasu's arteritis (TA) is described in this work in a defined area of Sweden, namely the Uppsala Hospital region (1.3 million inhabitants). During the eight year period 1969-1976 there were 15 cases of TA discharged from the hospitals in this region. The estimated yearly prevalence was 0.64 per 100,000 inhabitants. All subjects underwent angiography of the aorta and the main vessels. The authors point to the necessity of performing a total aortography. The most common lesions in this study were confined to the subclavian arteries in contrast to the commonly reported lesions of the aortic arch. Six of the fifteen subjects died during the study period. Those who died more often had hypertension hypercholesterolemia and were smokers to a greater extent than those who survived. Treatment with corticosteroids and azathioprine seemed to improve the prognosis. At present a total aortography and/or biopsy of the vessel at autopsy or operation is the most accurate way of establishing the diagnosis."
17047148,"Acquired hemophilia A is a severe bleeding disorder caused by an autoantibody to factor VIII. Previous reports have focused on referral center patients and it is unclear whether these findings are generally applicable. To improve understanding of the disease, a 2-year observational study was established to identify and characterize the presenting features and outcome of all patients with acquired hemophilia A in the United Kingdom. This allowed a consecutive cohort of patients, unbiased by referral or reporting practice, to be studied. A total of 172 patients with a median age of 78 years were identified, an incidence of 1.48/million/y. The cohort was significantly older than previously reported series, but bleeding manifestations and underlying diseases were similar. Bleeding was the cause of death in 9% of the cohort and remained a risk until the inhibitor had been eradicated. There was no difference in inhibitor eradication or mortality between patients treated with steroids alone and a combination of steroids and cytotoxic agents. Relapse of the inhibitor was observed in 20% of the patients who had attained first complete remission. The data provide the most complete description of acquired hemophilia A available and are applicable to patients presenting to all centers."
1512613,"An epidemiological survey of hereditary ataxias and paraplegias was conducted in Molise, a region of Italy (335, 211 inhabitants on 1 January 1989). Total prevalence was 7.5 x 10(-5) inhabitants (95% confidence limits 4.8-11.1). There were 7 patients with Friedreich's disease, 5 with early onset cerebellar ataxia with retained tendon reflexes, 4 with ataxia-telangiectasia, 9 with hereditary spastic paraplegias (2 autosomal dominant and 7 autosomal recessive cases). There was no patient with autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia."
10530081,"PURPOSE:To analyze the incidence and causes of fatality of patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) in Japan and to provide an opportunity for comparison with reports from other countries. METHODS:The Study Group of Phagocytic Disorders in Japan conducted a questionnaire survey on CGD patients in Japan, results of which formed the basis of the study. RESULTS:Clinical details of 221 patients were analyzed: 194 male and 27 female (ratio: 7.2/1), 152 living, 51 dead and 18 unknown. The prevalence of CGD was estimated to be 1/287,709 live births. The fatality rate was 23.1%. The mean age of the surviving patients increased from 8 years 4 months in 1985 to 16 years 0 months in 1998. Although the mean age of death was advanced by 4 years 11 months during the same period of time, the fatality rate has remained practically unchanged during the past 13 years. The number of living adult patients has tended to increase (32.1%). At the time of study, approximately 90% of patients had been placed on sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim prophylactically or therapeutically, either singly or in combination with other modalities, including interferon-gamma, antifungal agents and various antibiotics. Pulmonary infections were responsible for 58.3% of fatalities. CONCLUSIONS:With early diagnosis and prompt institution of appropriate therapy, the mean age of CGD patients in Japan has been increasing, but the fatality rate has remained practically unchanged during the last 13 years, mostly due to the fungal infections."
21943925,"BACKGROUND: Syringomyelia is a rare disease characterized by abnormal fluid-filled cavities within the spinal cord, and is associated with Chiari malformations, arachnoiditis, or spinal cord tumors. The widespread availability of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in Japan has allowed for easy identification of syrinxes. The aim of this study was to survey the clinicoepidemiological characteristics of syringomyelia in Japan. METHODS: A 2-stage postal survey was conducted in late 2009. The first survey aimed to estimate the number of patients with syringomyelia, and the second survey aimed to elucidate clinicoepidemiological characteristics. Diagnosis of syringomyelia was based on the findings of MRI or computed tomographic myelography. RESULTS: In the first survey, we received 2133 responses from 2937 randomly selected departments and collected data of 1215 syringomyelia patients (543 men and 672 women). The total response rate for the first survey was 73%. The estimated prevalence of ambulatory syringomyelia patients in Japan was 1.94 per 100000. In the second survey, the proportion of asymptomatic syringomyelia patients was 22.7%. Chiari type I malformations and idiopathic syringomyelia were the first and second most common etiologies. CONCLUSIONS: Our nationwide survey indicated that widespread MRI availability has contributed to the diagnosis of both asymptomatic and idiopathic cases."
19403164,"Cystic fibrosis is the most common lethal genetic disease in white populations. The outlook for patients with the disease has improved steadily over many years, largely as a result of earlier diagnosis, more aggressive therapy, and provision of care in specialised centres. Researchers now have a more complete understanding of the molecular-biological defect that underlies cystic fibrosis, which is leading to new approaches to treatment. One of these treatments, hypertonic saline, is already in use, whereas others are in advanced stages of development. We review clinical care for cystic fibrosis and discuss recent advances in the understanding of its pathogenesis, implementation of screening of neonates, and development of therapies aimed at treating the basic defect."
22098097,"BACKGROUND: Population-based studies on the epidemiology of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) are sparse. AIMS: To investigate mortality and risk of cancer, and to identify risk factors for hepatobiliary cancer and the combined end-point liver related death or liver transplantation (OLT) in a population-based PSC cohort in Västra Götaland, Sweden. METHODS: Primary sclerosing cholangitis cases were identified in diagnostic registries. Case validation and follow up was provided through individual review of case files and linkage to the Swedish Cancer and Cause of Death registries. Standardized mortality ratio (SMR) and standardized incidence ratio (SIR) for cancer were calculated in relation to the background population. Cox's proportional hazards analysis was used to calculate crude and adjusted relative risks (RRs). RESULTS: A total of 199 PSC patients were identified between 1992 and 2005. SMR in the PSC cohort was 4.20 (95% confidence interval (CI), 3.01-5.69). SIR for hepatobiliary cancer, cholangiocarcinoma and colorectal cancer were 177 (110-271), 868 (505-1390) and 2.87 (0.33-10.4) respectively. Age (RR=1.25 (1.01-1.53) per decade), female gender (RR=2.01 (1.09-3.72)), cholangitis (RR=2.56 (1.20-5.64)) and bilirubin (RR=3.95 (1.96-10.75) highest vs lowest quartile) were associated with the risk of liver related death or OLT. Age was associated with the risk of hepatobiliary cancer (RR 1.40 (1.01-1.95) per decade). CONCLUSIONS: Primary sclerosing cholangitis was associated with a four-fold increase in mortality in this population-based study. In accordance with previous studies, the risk of hepatobiliary cancer was dramatically increased. However, the increased risk of colorectal cancer reported in previous studies could not be confirmed."
7826096,"BACKGROUND AND DESIGN: The incidence and distribution of autoimmune subepidermal bullous diseases were estimated from prospective data (including immunoelectron microscopy) obtained from 100 cases during a mean period of 35 months in three university dermatologic centers in Amiens, Limoges, and Tours, France, that correspond to a cumulative reference population of 3.55 x 10(6). RESULTS: Using data from these regions, we found a mean annual incidence of autoimmune subepidermal bullous diseases to be 10.4 per million people and, therefore, estimated the overall number of new cases of these disorders in France to be about 590 cases per year. According to clinical and immunoelectron microscopic criteria, a precise diagnosis was established in 94 cases, distributed as follows: bullous pemphigoid, 69 cases; cicatricial pemphigoid, 12 cases; linear IgA dermatosis, five cases; herpes gestationis, four cases; epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, two cases; and vesiculobullous systemic lupus erythematosus, two cases. CONCLUSION: Our prospective study is the first assessing the incidence and distribution of autoimmune subepidermal bullous disorders that systematically included immunoelectron microscopic data. Our estimated incidence of bullous pemphigoid (seven new cases per million people per year) is large enough to establish bullous pemphigoid as the major autoimmune subepidermal bullous disease for the purpose of therapeutic trials. On the contrary, all other disorders, particularly epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (estimated annual incidence, 0.17 to 0.26 per million people), were very rare and reflect the paucity of patients available for short-term clinical studies in France."
27767273,"While most previous surveys on the clinico-epidemiological features of autoimmune bullous diseases (AIBDs) have predominantly focused on a single disease entity or just one disease group, there have been only few studies examining the incidence of various AIBDs. In the present study, we set out to determine the spectrum of AIBDs, to estimate the incidence of the most common AIBDs, and to examine their temporal trends in Central Serbia over a period of 20 years.We retrospectively recruited 1,161 new AIBD cases diagnosed in Central Serbia during the period from January 1991 to December 2010. The diagnosis was based on strict clinical, histological, and immunohistological evaluation.The incidence rates were: 4.35 per million population/year (pmp/year) for pemphigus, 4.47 pmp/year for pemphigoid, 1.42 pmp/year for dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), 0.25 pmp/year for linear IgA disease, and 0.08 pmp/year for epidermolysis bullosa acquisita. In the period observed, age-adjusted incidence rates significantly increased for pemphigus and particularly for pemphigoid, whereas they decreased, albeit not significantly, for DH.For the first time, our study evaluates the incidence rates of the entire spectrum of AIBDs in Serbia, and examines their temporal trends over a 20-year period. To the best of our knowledge, our finding of similar incidence rates for pemphigus and pemphigoid has previously not been reported."
23812182,"BACKGROUND: This study quantifies the association between maternal medical conditions/illnesses and congenital heart defects (CHDs) among infants. METHODS AND RESULTS: We carried out a population-based study of all mother-infant pairs (n=2,278,838) in Canada (excluding Quebec) from 2002 to 2010 using data from the Canadian Institute for Health Information. CHDs among infants were classified phenotypically through a hierarchical grouping of International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision, Canada codes. Maternal conditions such as multifetal pregnancy, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and congenital heart disease were defined by use of diagnosis codes. The association between maternal conditions and CHDs and its subtypes was modeled using logistic regression with adjustment for maternal age, parity, residence, and other factors. There were 26 488 infants diagnosed with CHDs at birth or at rehospitalization in infancy; the overall CHD prevalence was 116.2 per 10,000 live births, of which the severe CHD rate was 22.3 per 10,000. Risk factors for CHD included maternal age ≥40 years (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.48; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.39-1.58), multifetal pregnancy (aOR, 4.53; 95% CI, 4.28-4.80), diabetes mellitus (type 1: aOR, 4.65; 95% CI, 4.13-5.24; type 2: aOR, 4.12; 95% CI, 3.69-4.60), hypertension (aOR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.61-2.03), thyroid disorders (aOR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.26-1.67), congenital heart disease (aOR, 9.92; 95% CI, 8.36-11.8), systemic connective tissue disorders (aOR, 3.01; 95% CI, 2.23-4.06), and epilepsy and mood disorders (aOR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.16-1.72). Specific CHD subtypes were associated with different maternal risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Several chronic maternal medical conditions, including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, connective tissue disorders, and congenital heart disease, confer an increased risk of CHD in the offspring."
12627297,"This article is the third and last in a series entitled The Finnish Disease Heritage I-III. All the 36 rare hereditary diseases belonging to this entity are described for clinical and molecular genetic purposes, based on the Finnish experience gathered over a period of half a century. In addition, five other diseases are mentioned. They may be included in the list of the ""Finnish diseases"" after adequate complementary studies."
21493798,"Peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCLs) are a heterogeneous group of clinically aggressive diseases associated with poor outcome. Studies that focus specifically on PTCL are emerging, with the ultimate goal of improved understanding of disease biology and the development of more effective therapies. However, one of the difficulties in classifying and studying treatment options in clinical trials is the rarity of these subtypes. Various groups have developed lymphoma classifications over the years, including the World Health Organization, which updated its classification in 2008. This article briefly reviews the major lymphoma classification schema, highlights contributions made by the collaborative International PTCL Project, discusses prognostic issues and gene expression profiling, and outlines therapeutic approaches to PTCL. These include the standard chemotherapeutic regimens and other modalities incorporating antifolates, conjugates, histone deacetylase inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies, nucleoside analogs, proteasome inhibitors, and signaling inhibitors. As this review emphasizes, the problem has now evolved into an abundance of drugs and too few patients available to test them. Collaborative groups will aid in future efforts to find the best treatment strategies to improve the outcome for patients with PTCL."
27471207,"Our objective was to estimate the contemporary incidence and prevalence of sarcoidosis using Swedish population-based register data.Adults with any sarcoidosis-coded visit were identified from the National Patient Register (hospitalisations 1964-2013 and outpatient care 2001-2013). Demographic and medication dispensing data were retrieved from national registers. We estimated the prevalence of sarcoidosis in 2013 overall and by county of residence. The incidence of sarcoidosis during 2003-2012 was estimated by sex, age, education level and year of diagnosis. Case definitions were varied to test their robustness.More than 16 000 individuals had a history of sarcoidosis in 2013. When defined as two or more sarcoidosis-coded visits, the prevalence was 160 per 100 000. Using different definitions, the prevalence ranged from 152 (requiring a specialist visit) to 215 per 100 000 (only one visit required). The highest prevalence was observed in northern less densely populated counties. The incidence was 11.5 per 100 000 per year and varied by -10% to +30% depending on case definition. The incidence peaked in males aged 30-50 years and in females aged 50-60 years, but did not differ by education level and was stable over time.This study represents the largest epidemiological investigation of sarcoidosis using population-based individual-level data. Age at diagnosis in men was 10 years younger than in women and geographical variation was observed."
9151309,"The epidemiology of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCL) in Scandinavia was studied. For juvenile NCL 40 Swedish living patients were identified. The corresponding number for Finland was 61, for Norway 28, for Denmark 16 and for Iceland three. The prevalence of juvenile NCL was thus 4.6, 12.2, 6.5, 3.1 and 11 per million inhabitants in Sweden, Finland, Norway, Denmark, and Iceland, respectively. For calculating incidence the years 1976-85 were used. The incidence was 2.2 per 100,000 live births in Sweden, 4.8 in Finland, 3.7 in Norway, 2.0 in Denmark, and 7.0 in Iceland. Late infantile NCL was found in five Swedish children, including one variant form, CLN5. This gives a prevalence of about 0.6 per million. In Finland 13 cases gave a prevalence of 2.6 per million with the variant form in 80% of cases. In Norway, three children corresponded to a prevalence of 0.7 per million and one case in Iceland to 3.8 per million. No Danish cases were reported. As for infantile NCL, sixteen Swedish cases have been diagnosed during the 27-year period 1968-95, six are presently alive. This gives an estimated prevalence of 0.7 per million and an incidence of 0.6 per 100,000. The prevalence and incidence of infantile NCL in Finland were 5.4 per million and 5 per 100,000, respectively. The prevalence in Norway was 0.2 per million inhabitants. The variability of onset, clinical course and symptoms in the Swedish cases of juvenile and infantile NCL were analysed."
22495831,"Costello syndrome and cardio-facio-cutaneous (CFC) syndrome are congenital anomaly syndromes characterized by a distinctive facial appearance, heart defects, and intellectual disability. Germline mutations in HRAS cause Costello syndrome, and mutations in KRAS, BRAF, and MAP2K1/2 (MEK1/2) cause CFC syndrome. Since the discovery of the causative genes, approximately 150 new patients with each syndrome have been reported. However, the clinico-epidemiological features of these disorders remain to be identified. In order to assess the prevalence, natural history, prognosis, and tumor incidence associated with these diseases, we conducted a nationwide prevalence study of patients with Costello and CFC syndromes in Japan. Based on the result of our survey, we estimated a total number of patients with either Costello syndrome or CFC syndrome in Japan of 99 (95% confidence interval, 77-120) and 157 (95% confidence interval, 86-229), respectively. The prevalences of Costello and CFC syndromes are estimated to be 1 in 1,290,000 and 1 in 810,000 individuals, respectively. An evaluation of 15 adult patients 18-32 years of age revealed that 12 had moderate to severe intellectual disability and most live at home without constant medical care. These results suggested that the number of adult patients is likely underestimated and our results represent a minimum prevalence. This is the first epidemiological study of Costello syndrome and CFC syndrome. Identifying patients older than 32 years of age and following up on the patients reported here is important to estimate the precise prevalence and the natural history of these disorders."
12543880,"BACKGROUND:Primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1) is a phenotypically heterogeneous disease. To date the relationship between biochemical parameters and outcome is unclear. We therefore undertook a national cohort study on biochemical and clinical parameters and outcome in PH1. METHODS:Review of medical charts of all Dutch PH1 patients, who were identified by sending questionnaires to all Dutch nephrologists for children and adults. RESULTS:Fifty-seven patients were identified. The prevalence and incidence rates were 2.9/10(6) and 0.15/10(6)/year, respectively. Median age at diagnosis was 7.3 years (range 0-57). Seventeen (30%) patients were older than 18 years at time of diagnosis, of whom 10 (59%) presented with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), in contrast to only nine (23%) of those aged under 18 years. Median age at initial symptoms was 6.0 years (range 0-50). In four of nine patients with infantile PH1, normal renal function was preserved after a median follow-up of 7.7 years (range 0.1-16). Progression to renal insufficiency was associated with the presence of nephrocalcinosis, as assessed by ultrasound (relative risk=1.8; 95% CI, 1.0-3.4) and with pyridoxine-unresponsiveness (relative risk=2.2; 95% CI, 1.1-4.2) but not with age at presentation, the extent of hyperoxaluria, or AGT activity. No apparent nephrocalcinosis was found in five of the 19 patients who presented with ESRD. CONCLUSIONS:Although more than one-half of the PH1 patients have symptoms under the age of 10 years, PH1 can present at any age. In adults, PH1 presents predominantly with ESRD, which may be due to misinterpretation of early symptoms. Although nephrocalcinosis is correlated with development of renal insufficiency, the latter can occur even in the absence of nephrocalcinosis. Pyridoxine sensitivity is associated with better outcome in PH1."
21186939,"The increasing incidence of thyroid cancer in the United States is well documented. In this study, we assessed the incidence patterns by histologic type according to demographic and tumor characteristics to further our understanding of these cancers.We used the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program for cases diagnosed during 1992-2006 to investigate patterns for the four major histologic types of thyroid cancer by gender, race/ethnicity, and age as well as registry, tumor stage, and size.Among women, papillary thyroid cancer rates were highest among Asians (10.96 per 100,000 woman-years) and lowest among blacks (4.90 per 100,000 woman-years); follicular cancer rates did not vary substantially by race/ethnicity (p-values >0.05), medullary cancer rates were highest among Hispanics (0.21 per 100,000 woman-years) and whites (0.22 per 100,000 woman-years), and anaplastic rates were highest among Hispanics (0.17 per 100,000 woman-years). Among men, both papillary and follicular thyroid cancer rates were highest among whites (3.58 and 0.58 per 100,000 man-years, respectively), medullary cancer rates were highest among Hispanics (0.18 per 100,000 man-years), and anaplastic rates were highest among Asians (0.11 per 100,000 man-years). Racial/ethnic-specific rates did not vary notably across registries. In contrast to age-specific rates of papillary thyroid cancer that peaked in midlife (age 50), especially pronounced among women, rates for follicular, medullary, and anaplastic types continued to rise across virtually the entire age range, especially for anaplastic carcinomas. Female-to-male incidence rate ratios among whites decreased with age most steeply for the follicular type and least steeply for the medullary type; it was <1 until the very oldest ages for the anaplastic type.We conclude that the similar age-specific patterns and lack of geographical variation across the SEER racial/ethnic groups indicate that detection effects cannot completely explain the observed thyroid cancer incidence patterns as variation in the amount or quality of healthcare provided has been shown to vary by SEER racial/ethnic groups, gender, and age. We find that the variations in age-specific patterns by gender and across histologic types are intriguing and recommend that future etiologic investigation focus on exogenous and endogenous exposures that are experienced similarly by racial/ethnic groups, more strongly among women, and distinctively by age."
22787376,"This study represents the first epidemiological study based on the national registry of primary immunodeficiencies (PID) in Korea. Patient data were collected from 23 major hospitals. A total of 152 patients with PID (under 19 yr of age), who were observed from 2001 to 2005, have been entered in this registry. The period prevalence of PID in Korea in 2005 is 11.25 per million children. The following frequencies were found: antibody deficiencies, 53.3% (n = 81), phagocytic disorders, 28.9% (n = 44); combined immunodeficiencies, 13.2% (n = 20); and T cell deficiencies, 4.6% (n = 7). Congenital agammaglobulinemia (n = 21) and selective IgA deficiency (n = 21) were the most frequently reported antibody deficiency. Other reported deficiencies were common variable immunodeficiencies (n = 16), X-linked agammaglobulinemia (n = 15), IgG subclass deficiency (n = 4). Phagocytic disorder was mostly chronic granulomatous disease. A small number of patients with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, hyper-IgE syndrome, and severe combined immunodeficiency were also registered. Overall, the most common first manifestation was pneumonia. This study provides data that permit a more accurate estimation PID patients in Korea."
22173164,"Cholangiocarcinomas (CC) can be sub-divided into intrahepatic (IHCC) or extrahepatic (EHCC). Hilar or 'Klatskin' tumours are anatomically extrahepatic. Most international studies, also from the UK, report increasing IHCC and decreasing EHCC incidence. The second edition of the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O-2) assigned 'Klatskin' tumours a unique histology code (8162/3), but this was cross-referenced to the topography code for intrahepatic (IHBD) rather than extrahepatic bile duct tumours (EHBD). Under the third ICD-O edition, 'Klatskin' tumours are cross-referenced to either IHBD or EHBD. New editions of the ICD-O classification are adopted at different time points by different countries. We investigated the impact of changing ICD-O classifications and the potential misclassification of hilar/'Klatskin' tumours on bile duct tumour and CC incidence rates in England and Wales and the US. We also examined whether coding practices by cancer registries in England and Wales could be influencing these rates.We analysed age-standardised incidence rates (ASIR) in England and Wales for IHBD and EHBD tumours between 1990 and 2008, then transferred all 'Klatskin' tumours from IHBD to EHBD and reanalysed rates from 1995, when ICD-O-2 was introduced in the UK. We also compared trends in IHBD, EHBD, and 'Klatskin' tumours in England and Wales with those in the USSEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results) database. Coding practice at Cancer registry level in England and Wales was investigated via a questionnaire completed by all national cancer registries.In England and Wales, 1990-2008, ASIR of IHBD cancers rose (0.43-1.84/100,000 population in males; 0.27-1.51 in females) but fell for EHBD (0.78-0.51/100,000 population in males; 0.62-0.39 in females). After transferring all 'Klatskin' tumours from IHBD to EHBD, there remained a marked increase in ASIR of IHBD cancers and a decrease in ASIR for EHBD, as only 1% of CC were reportedly 'Klatskin'. The US SEER data showed that ASIR for IHBD gradually rose from 0.59/100,000 population in 1990 to 0.91 in 2001, then sharply fell before plateauing at 0.60 by 2007. ASIR for EHBD remained relatively stable at around 0.80/100,000 population until 2001, then began increasing, to 0.97 by 2007. Annually, between 1995 and 2008, the vast majority of 'Klatskin' tumours in England and Wales were coded as IHBD. This was also the case in the SEER data until 2001, when the situation was reversed and subsequently most 'Klatskin' tumours were coded as EHBD. US trends coincide with a switch from ICD-O2 to ICD-O-3 in 2001. In the UK, the switch to ICD-O-3 only occurred in 2008. On questioning, cancer registries in England and Wales stated they would not code a CC described as 'hilar' with the designated 'Klatskin' histology code. If the tumour site is unspecified, most registries classify CC as intrahepatic.Changes in ICD-classification may be influencing observed changes in IHBD and EHBD incidence rates. Coding misclassification is likely to have been skewing CC registration to an intrahepatic site, thereby contributing to the previously reported rise in intrahepatic tumours."
19260065,"Epidemiologic data on chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) is limited, and previous studies have shown variable results. The frequencies of CIDP subtypes remain unknown. Variations due to use of different diagnostic criteria have not been studied. We examined the prevalence and incidence of CIDP in Leicestershire and Rutland, UK (population 963,600). Prevalence day was 1 May 2008. The prevalence of CIDP fulfilling the 2006 clinical and electrophysiologic European Federation of Neurological Societies/Peripheral Nerve Society (EFNS/PNS) criteria was 4.77 per 100,000 (95% confidence interval [CI] 3.49-6.37). Using the 1991 American Academy of Neurology (AAN) criteria, the prevalence was 1.97 per 100,000 in this population (95% CI 1.19-3.08). Lewis-Sumner syndrome was diagnosed in 15.2% of patients, and 23.9% had pure sensory onset. Over 40% required no immunotherapy, and 84.6% of those treated responded. More than 80% of the AAN criteria-negative but EFNS/PNS criteria-positive patients were responsive to treatment. Both sets of criteria were equally likely to identify patients who required therapy. The mean annual incidence rate over the 3 years preceding the prevalence day was 0.70 per 100,000/year using EFNS/PNS criteria (95% CI 0.43-1.08), and 0.35 per 100,000/year using AAN criteria (95% CI 0.17-0.64). We conclude that the AAN criteria may underestimate prevalence and incidence of the disease. The EFNS/PNS criteria provide higher diagnostic sensitivity and are of greater clinical relevance, and they also offer a useful breakdown of the epidemiologic data for CIDP subtypes."
2330114,"The prevalence of myotonic dystrophy (MyD) in the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean (SLSJ) region (Quebec, Canada) is 30 to 60 times the world's prevalence. We identified 746 patients (673 still alive) distributed in 88 families. Using a population-based register of the SLSJ area and several marriage repositories from northeastern Quebec, we could trace back all patients to a couple who settled in ""Nouvelle-France"" in 1657. The MyD gene was then passed on over 10 to 14 generations. This genealogical reconstruction is a strong argument in favor of the genetic homogeneity of MyD in the SLSJ region."
22178098,"BACKGROUND: The elimination of rubella and prevention of congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) by 2015 are established goals for Europe. Our aim was to review the epidemiology of rubella in relation to this goal. MATERIAL AND METHODS: National surveillance institutions from 32 European countries provided information on rubella and CRS surveillance systems and data for 2000-08. We reported the number of notified rubella cases by year for countries with a national mandatory notification system for rubella covering total country population consistently throughout 2000-08 and analysed rubella surveillance data for 2008. RESULTS: Throughout 2000-08, 24 countries conducted passive routine surveillance based on mandatory reporting rubella covering total country population. Altogether these countries reported 526,751 rubella cases. The median incidence per million inhabitants declined from 7.2 in 2000 to 0.3 in 2008. By 2008, the number of countries with mandatory notification systems for rubella increased to 28. These countries reported 21,475 rubella cases of which 1.5% (n=317) were laboratory-confirmed. Most cases (n=21,075; 98%) were reported from Poland, Italy and Romania. Ten countries reported zero rubella cases and five others reported an incidence of <1 per million inhabitants. In 2008, 20 CRS cases were reported from five countries. CONCLUSION: The overall decline in rubella incidence and increase in the number of countries conducting rubella surveillance through a mandatory notification system are notable achievements toward the goal of rubella elimination in Europe. However, in a few countries with high rubella incidence the risk for CRS still exists. Achievement and maintenance of the required high vaccination coverage and high-quality surveillance of rubella and CRS including laboratory testing of all suspected cases are fundamental to eliminate rubella and prevent CRS in Europe."
12762638,"Thyroid hormones are very important for the child mental and physical development. In southeast Poland screening for congenital hypothyroidism detection was established in 1985; this region was defined as an iodine deficient area. The results provided the first signal pointing to insufficient iodine prophylaxis in the region. In the years 1985-2000, a total of 634,179 newborns were tested. TSH levels in blood spots on filter paper were determined using three consecutive methods: RIA, fluoroimmunometry (FIA) and luminoimmunemetry (LIA). In the first five years of the program, the incidence of permanent hypothyroidism was 1:4,000, while the incidence of iodine deficiency disorders (IDD) was 1:272. These findings led to the recognition of the fact that iodine prophylaxis had been discontinued in 1981 and reintroduced in 1992 and from that time on the incidence of IDD in neonates has been evidently lower. In the period between 1991 and 2000, we observed a 0.14% incidence rate of IDD, while until 1991 it had been 0.5%. In the years 1998-2000, the respective value was 1:5,420. The incidence of transient hypothyroidism also dropped from 1:3,920 to 1:48,474. Therefore we conclude that, based on screening studies carried out since 1985, the analysis of TSH levels may be regarded as a tool for iodine deficiency monitoring in neonates. Between 1985-2000, a drop in the incidence of IDD in newborns is clearly seen. Moreover, investigations carried out in particular years show that even low-grade iodine supplementation leads to TSH level decrease in newborns."
23111802,"Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is a hereditary autoinflammatory disease that is prevalent in Mediterranean populations. While it is considered a rare disease in the rest of world, a significant number of FMF patients have been reported in East Asia, including Japan. Our aim was to determine the prevalence of FMF in Japan and elucidate the clinical and genetic features of Japanese patients. A primary nationwide survey of FMF was conducted between January and December 2009. Hospitals specializing in pediatrics and hospitals with pediatric, internal medicine, and rheumatology/allergy departments were asked to report all patients with FMF during the survey year. The estimated total number of Japanese FMF patients was 292 (95% confidence interval, 187-398 people). We evaluated the clinical and genetic profiles of Japanese patients from the data obtained in a secondary survey of 134 FMF patients. High-grade fever was observed in 95.5%, chest pain (pleuritis symptoms) in 36.9%, abdominal pain (peritonitis symptoms) in 62.7%, and arthritis in 31.3%. Of the patients profiled, 25.4% of patients experienced their first attack before 10 years of age, 37.3% in their teens, and 37.3% after age 20 years. Colchicine was effective in 91.8% of patients at a relatively low dose (mean dose, 0.89 ± 0.45 mg/d). AA amyloidosis was confirmed in 5 patients (3.7%). Of the 126 patients studied, 109 (86.5%) were positive for 1 or more genetic mutations and 17 (13.5%) had no mutation detected. Common Mediterranean fever gene (MEFV) mutations were E148Q/M694I (19.8%) and M694I/normal (12.7%). The differences in the prevalence of peritonitis, pleuritis, and a family history of FMF were statistically significant between FMF patients with MEFV exon 10 mutations compared with those without exon 10 mutations.In conclusion, a significant number of patients with FMF exist in Japan. Although Japanese patients with FMF are clinically or genetically different from Mediterranean patients, the delay in diagnosis is an issue that should be resolved."
7987462,"BACKGROUND: French Polynesia includes several ethnic groups; thus, it is well suited for evaluation of racial incidence of extrahepatic biliary atresia (BA). On the other hand, its geographic localization, far from specialized centers, does not facilitate early referral, indispensable for effective surgery. POPULATION AND METHODS: The files of 17 infants with BA, born in French Polynesia between 1 December 1981 and 1 December 1991, were retrospectively studied. During this period, there were 53,111 live births. RESULTS: The incidence of BA was 1/3,124. There were eight boys and nine girls; all belonged to the Maohi ethnic group (67% of the total population). They were admitted at the mean age of 71 +/- 33 days (range: 15-120 days); 15 of them were transferred to France at a mean age of 80 +/- 38 days (range: 35-150 days) and were operated on at 99 +/- 43 days (range: 48-195 days). The Kasai procedure was effective in four patients, with a follow-up ranging from 7 to 10 years. Among the 11 other patients, two underwent liver transplantation, four are waiting for transplantation and four have died. CONCLUSIONS: The influence of race on the incidence of BA has not been statistically established here even though this incidence appears high in French Polynesia and similar to Chinese babies in Hawaii. Local geographic conditions explain late admission in pediatric Units whereas possibilities for early surgery are improving."
23116348,"An analysis of incidences of selected birth defects in the Czech Republic in 2000 - 2008 period.Retrospective epidemiological analysis of birth defects incidences in births and total birth defects incidences (including prenatally diagnosed cases) from the Czech National Birth Defects Register database.Data from the National Birth Defects Register (Institute for Health Information and Statistics) in the Czech Republic in the 2000 - 2008 period were used along with data on prenatally diagnosed defects from particular departments of medical genetics. Sixteen selected defects (anencephaly, spina bifida, encephalocele, congenital hydrocephalus, coarctation of aorta, transposition of great vessels, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, Fallot tetralogy, omphalocele, gastroschisis, diaphragmatic hernia, oesophageal atresia and stenosis, anorectal malformations, Down syndrome, Edwards syndrome and Patau syndrome) were analyzed in detail.There were 119 570 live births (61 326 boys and 58 244 girls) in 2008. In the same period, 4664 live births with a birth defect (under the age of one year) were reported, out of which 2754 boys and 1910 girls. Mean incidence was 390.06 (449.08 in boys and 327.93 in girls) per 10 000 live births. In 1994 - 2006, totally 1 238 398 children were born, out of which more than 42 000 with a birth defect. In the 2000 - 2006 period, absolute numbers of diagnosed live births with birth defect varied between 3600 - 3800 cases per year while in 2007 and 2008 years absolute numbers raised over 4600 cases per year. During 2000 - 2008 period following mean incidences (per 10 000 live births) of selected defects were ascertained (total incidences including prenatal diagnostics in brackets): anencephaly 0 - 0.3 (1.9 - 3.7), spina bifida 0.7 - 2.3 (3.2 - 5.2), encephalocele 0.1 - 0.4 (0.9 - 2.4), congenital hydrocephalus 1.6 - 3.5 (5.3 - 7.0), coarctation of aorta 3.9 - 5.2 (4.8 - 6.1), transposition of great vessels 2.9 - 4.5 (3.2 - 5.0), hypoplastic left heart syndrome 0.7 - 2.3 (2.2 - 4.3), Fallot tetralogy 2.6 - 4.0 (3.2 - 4.4), omphalocele 1.0 - 1.7 (1.8 - 3.8), gastroschisis 0.2 - 1.2 (2.4 - 3.4), diaphragmatic hernia 1.3 - 2.9 (1.5 - 3.9), Down syndrome 3.3 - 6.5 (15.8 - 22.2), Edwards syndrome 0.2 - 1.0 (3.5 - 5.8) and Patau syndrome 0.2 - 1.0 (1.2 - 2.6).There has been no major change in birth defect incidences in live births in the Czech Republic in last years. Number of non-viable defects has decreased in stillbirths and in perinatal mortality in the Czech Republic. An incidence of some defects has decreased mostly due to a nation-wide system of prenatal diagnostics; some incidences remain stable in live-birth population in others incidences have increased. A total incidence has mostly increased (anencephaly being an exception) mostly due to an earlier prenatal diagnostics. In chromosomal syndromes, an increasing maternal age as well as a growing number of mothers of 35 years of age and over has contributed to the increased incidences."
22766612,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to describe the birth prevalence of genetic disorders among different racial/ethnic groups through population-based newborn screening data. METHODS: Between 7 July 2005 and 6 July 2010 newborns in California were screened for selected metabolic, endocrine, hemoglobin, and cystic fibrosis disorders using a blood sample collected via heel stick. The race and ethnicity of each newborn was self-reported by the mother at the time of specimen collection. RESULTS: Of 2,282,138 newborns screened, the overall disorder detection rate was 1 in 500 births. The disorder with the highest prevalence among all groups was primary congenital hypothyroidism (1 in 1,706 births). Birth prevalence for specific disorders varied widely among different racial/ethnic groups. CONCLUSION: The California newborn screening data offer a unique opportunity to explore the birth prevalence of many genetic disorders across a wide spectrum of racial/ethnicity classifications. The data demonstrate that racial/ethnic subgroups of the California newborn population have very different patterns of heritable disease expression. Determining the birth prevalence of these disorders in California is a first step to understanding the short- and long-term medical and treatment needs faced by affected communities, especially those groups that are impacted by more severe disorders."
28595941,"The aim of this study was to obtain data about the epidemiology of the different types of mucopolysaccharidoses in Japan and Switzerland and to compare with similar data from other countries. Data for Japan was collected between 1982 and 2009, and 467 cases with MPS were identified. The combined birth prevalence was 1.53 per 100,000 live births. The highest birth prevalence was 0.84 for MPS II, accounting for 55% of all MPS. MPS I, III, and IV accounted for 15, 16, and 10%, respectively. MPS VI and VII were more rare and accounted for 1.7 and 1.3%, respectively. A retrospective epidemiological data collection was performed in Switzerland between 1975 and 2008 (34years), and 41 living MPS patients were identified. The combined birth prevalence was 1.56 per 100,000 live births. The highest birth prevalence was 0.46 for MPS II, accounting for 29% of all MPS. MPS I, III, and IV accounted for 12, 24, and 24%, respectively. As seen in the Japanese population, MPS VI and VII were more rare and accounted for 7.3 and 2.4%, respectively. The high birth prevalence of MPS II in Japan was comparable to that seen in other East Asian countries where this MPS accounted for approximately 50% of all forms of MPS. Birth prevalence was also similar in some European countries (Germany, Northern Ireland, Portugal and the Netherlands) although the prevalence of other forms of MPS is also reported to be higher in these countries. Birth prevalence of MPS II in Switzerland and other European countries is comparatively lower. The birth prevalence of MPS III and IV in Switzerland is higher than in Japan but comparable to that in most other European countries. Moreover, the birth prevalence of MPS VI and VII was very low in both, Switzerland and Japan. Overall, the frequency of MPS varies for each population due to differences in ethnic backgrounds and/or founder effects that affect the birth prevalence of each type of MPS, as seen for other rare genetic diseases. Methods for identification of MPS patients are not uniform across all countries, and consequently, if patients are not identified, recorded prevalence rates will be aberrantly low."
23075697,"BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Eosinophilic oesophagitis (EoE) is a common cause of oesophageal disease. Limited data have been reported on its epidemiology in Europe as the only available information has been estimated for Swiss adult patients, among whom a prevalence of 42.9 per 100,000 was calculated. We estimate for the first time the prevalence of EoE in adult patients in two healthcare areas located in a central region of Spain. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients older than 16 years of age and living in the study areas appointed to two hospitals located in a central region of Spain who were consecutively diagnosed with EoE between 2005 and 2011 were analyzed retrospectively. Annual incidence and period prevalence were estimated along with a confidence interval (CI) of 95%. RESULTS: Between January 2005 and December 2011, 40 adult patients were diagnosed with EoE in our areas, with an average overall adult reference population of 89 642. No significant differences in clinical data or prevalence figures were found between both hospitals. The average age was 29.4 years (rank 16-53), 80% of patients being younger than 40 years of age. The estimated mean annual incidence of adult EoE for the study period was 6.37 per 100 000 (95% CI: 6.31-6.44) and remained relatively stable during the study period. The period prevalence was 44.6 cases per 100 000 inhabitants (95% CI: 30-59), with a male/female ratio of 19 : 1. CONCLUSION: EoE was highly prevalent in adults from central Spain, being diagnosed in one out of 2250 inhabitants older than 16 years of age."
2003856,"We studied the epidemiology of giant cell arteritis (GCA) and polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) in a Mediterranean population. Ninety-nine patients with PMR and/or GCA were identified over a 9-year period (1980-1988) in Reggio Emilia, Italy. The average annual incidence of PMR and GCA was 12.7/100,000 and 6.9/100,000, respectively, in a population aged 50 years or older. Frequencies of HLA antigens were determined in 49 patients with PMR and/or GCA who were followed by staff at our rheumatology unit during the 1980-1988 period. When compared with HLA findings in 242 healthy controls, DR4 was not found to be significantly associated with PMR (24% in PMR patients versus 14% in controls). Patients with GCA also showed an increased frequency of DR4 compared with controls (36% versus 14%), but this difference was also not statistically significant. The immunogenetic features of PMR and GCA and the relationship between the immunogenetic and epidemiologic patterns in different populations are discussed."
12837874,"OBJECTIVES:Although several studies describe the 22q11.2 deletion, population-based data are scant. Such data are needed to evaluate properly the impact, distribution, and clinical presentation of the deletion in the population. Our goals were to assess the population-based birth prevalence of the 22q11.2 deletion and its associated phenotype and its impact on the occurrence of heart defects. METHODS:We evaluated data on infants who were born from 1994 through 1999 to women who resided in metropolitan Atlanta. We matched records from the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program (a population-based registry with active case ascertainment), the Sibley Heart Center at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, and the Division of Medical Genetics at Emory University. We used birth certificate data for the denominators of the rates. RESULTS:We identified 43 children with laboratory-confirmed 22q11.2 deletion among 255 849 births. The overall prevalence was 1 in 5950 births (95% confidence interval: 1 in 4417 to 1 in 8224 births). The prevalence was between 1 in 6000 and 1 in 6500 among whites, blacks, and Asians and 1 in 3800 among Hispanics. Most affected children (81%) had a heart defect, and many (1 in 3) had major extracardiac defects (other than velopalatal anomalies), including anomalies of the central nervous system. Overall, the deletion contributed to at least 1 of every 68 cases of major heart defects identified in the total birth cohort and, in particular, to 1 of every 2 cases diagnosed with interrupted aortic arch type B, 1 of every 5 with truncus arteriosus, and 1 of every 8 with tetralogy of Fallot. CONCLUSIONS:The 22q11.2 deletion was common in this birth population. The clinical phenotype included a wide and variable spectrum of major cardiac and extracardiac anomalies. From these population-based data, one can estimate that at least 700 affected infants are born annually in the United States. Population-based estimates such as these should be useful to medical professionals and policy makers in planning for the optimal care of people with the 22q11.2 deletion."
28475583,"Sarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous inflammatory disease whose causes are still unknown and for which epidemiological data are often discordant. The aim of our study is to investigate prevalence and spatial distribution of cases, and identify environmental exposures associated with sarcoidosis in an Italian province.After georeferentiation of cases, the area under study was subdivided with respect to Municipality and Health Districts and to the altitude in order to identify zonal differences in prevalence. The bioaccumulation levels of 12 metals in lichen tissues were analyzed, in order to determine sources of air pollution. Finally, the analysis of the correlation between metals and between pickup stations was performed.223 patients were identified (58.3% female and 41.7% male of total) and the mean age was 50.6±15.4 years (53.5±15.5 years for the females and 46.5±14.4 for the males). The mean prevalence was 49 per 100.000 individuals. However, we observed very heterogeneous prevalence in the area under study. The correlations among metals revealed different deposition patterns in lowland area respect to hilly and mountain areas.The study highlights a high prevalence of sarcoidosis cases, characterized by a very inhomogeneous and patchy distribution with phenomena of local aggregation. Moreover, the bioaccumulation analysis was an effective method to identify the mineral particles that mostly contribute to air pollution in the different areas, but it was not sufficient to establish a clear correlation between the onset of sarcoidosis and environmental risk factors."
29105741,"Huntington disease (HD) is most prevalent among populations of western European descent and isolated populations where founder effects may operate. The aim of this study was to examine the epidemiology of HD in Cyprus, an island in southern Europe with extensive western European colonization in the past. All registered HD patients in the Cyprus, since 1994, were included. Detailed pedigrees and clinical information were recorded and maps, showing the geographic distribution of HD, were constructed. Requests for genetic testing were also examined. The project identified 58 clinically manifested cases of HD belonging to 19 families. The 16 families of Cypriot origin were concentrated in a confined geographical cluster in southeast Cyprus. In 2015, prevalence of symptomatic HD was 4.64/100 000 population, while incidence was 0.12/100 000 person-years. Prevalence displayed a marked increase during the past 20 years. Disease characteristics of HD patients were similar to those reported in western European populations. Lastly, the uptake of predictive and/or prenatal testing was limited. HD disease characteristics, incidence and prevalence in Cyprus were comparable to western European populations. Together with the geographical clustering observed, these results support the possibility for a relatively recent founder effect of HD in Cyprus, potentially of western European origin."
2204987,"The first results of a collaborative study aimed at collecting all French families affected by oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) and their genealogy are presented. The study was carried out in 28 families in whom the diagnosis of OPMD in the propositus was confirmed by the presence of typical intranuclear tubulo-filamentous inclusions in the muscle biopsy. Results suggest that the prevalence of OPMD in France is at least of 1/200,000. The disease has been observed in many countries but to our knowledge no epidemiological studies have been reported so far. However, it is known to be particularly frequent in the French-Canadian community living in Canada and USA. In the present study genealogical researches were carried out in 18 families. Three families were of Italian and two of Armenian origin. Amongst the 13 families of French ascent, 3 familial relationships were found: one from a couple married in 1783. In the other 10 French families, no interlineage was discovered in a genealogical enquiry pursued back to the 18th century. Further studies are needed to find out whether there was only one mutation responsible for all French cases or whether several mutations occurred in France, as suggested by the present study. It would be also interesting to ascertain whether there is a parental link between the French and the French-Canadian OPMD patients, the latter considered to be descendants of a couple who emigrated to Quebec in 1634."
18771432,"BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to determine the epidemiology of primary systemic vasculitis in the Australian Capital Territory and the surrounding rural region between 1995 and 2005. METHODS: Cases were ascertained by a medical record search according to international consensus classification criteria. For antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitides, ascertainment was corroborated by a search of all positive antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody serology during the study period. Denominators were obtained from region-specific census data collected during the study period. Prevalence, incidence and patient characteristics for primary systemic vasculitides were determined for two 5-year periods, 1995-1999 and 2000-2004. RESULTS: We identified 41 cases of primary systemic vasculitides (Wegener's granulomatosis (WG), microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), Churg-Strauss syndrome or polyarteritis nodosa) between 1995 and 1999 and 67 between 2000 and 2004, giving prevalences of 95/million (95% confidence interval (CI) 76.9-116.1) and 148/million (95%CI 125.1-173.9), respectively. Annual incidence was similar in both periods (approximately 17/year per million adult population). Disease-specific incidences (per million per year) for each of the two periods were 8.8 and 8.4 for WG, 2.3 and 5.0 for MPA, 2.3 and 2.2 for Churg-Strauss syndrome and 2.3 and 1.1 for polyarteritis nodosa. The rural incidence of MPA was 13.9 (95%CI 7.7-23.5) compared with 1.6 (95%CI 0.2-7.2) in the city and there was a trend towards a higher incidence of WG in rural than urban areas. CONCLUSION: The overall incidence of primary systemic vasculitides is similar to that reported from other developed countries. WG is more common in south-eastern Australia than in southern Europe, whereas MPA is less common. There was a trend towards higher incidence of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitides in rural than urban areas."
3405368,"During a 4-year study period, January 1983 to December 1986, 24 patients (18 index cases) with spinal muscular atrophy (hereditary motor neuropathy, HMN), 9 with myasthenia gravis (MG), 6 with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and 5 with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) were diagnosed in Benghazi. The HMN group comprised 6 acute infantile, 12 chronic childhood, and 3 each with adult-onset proximal, and distal forms of the disease. The crude average annual incidence of acute infantile HMN was 0.3/100,000 total population and 1/12,500 births in Benghazi. The crude prevalence rates of chronic childhood, adult-onset proximal, and distal types of HMN were 2.3, 0.6 and 0.6/100,000, respectively. The larger family size and the high rate of consanguineous marriages contribute to the high frequency of HMN in the study area. Distal HMN constituted 12.5% of the total cases. The adjusted average incidence of MG was 4.4/million/year, 2.1 for males and 6.8 for females. The female:male incidence ratio was 3.2:1. The crude average annual incidence rates/million inhabitants for PSP asnd SSPE were 3 and 2.4, respectively. The frequency of occurrence of SSPE among the subtropical Arab community under investigation is comparable with other surveys from the Middle East and Mediterranean region."
20567911,"In Taiwan, during the period March 2000 to June 2009, 1,495,132 neonates were screened for phenylketonuria (PKU) and homocystinuria (HCU), and 1,321,123 neonates were screened for maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), methylmalonic academia (MMA), medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency, isovaleric academia (IVA), and glutaric aciduria type 1 (GA-1) using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). In a pilot study, 592,717 neonates were screened for citrullinemia, 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase deficiency (3-MCC) and other fatty acid oxidation defects in the MS/MS newborn screening. A total of 170 newborns and four mothers were confirmed to have inborn errors of metabolism. The overall incidence was approximately 1/5,882 (1/6,219 without mothers). The most common inborn errors were defects of phenylalanine metabolism [five classic PKU, 20 mild PKU, 40 mild hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA), and 13 6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin synthase (PTPS) deficiency]. MSUD was the second most common amino acidopathy and, significantly, most MSUD patients (10/13) belonged to the Austronesian aboriginal tribes of southern Taiwan. The most frequently detected among organic acid disorders was 3-MCC deficiency (14 newborns and four mothers). GA-1 and MMA were the second most common organic acid disorders (13 and 13 newborns, respectively). In fatty acid disorders, five carnitine transport defect (CTD), five short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (SCAD), and two medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency were confirmed. This is the largest case of MS/MS newborn screening in an East-Asian population to date. We hereby report the incidences and outcomes of metabolic inborn error diseases found in our nationwide MS/MS newborn screening program."
16610025,"AIM:To investigate the prevalence and clinical pattern of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) in Hong Kong Chinese, and to assess the impact of introduction of CD117 on the disease incidence. METHODS:From the database of the Department of Pathology of Yan Chai Hospital, 47 patients, with GISTs from September 1995 to December 2003 were included in this study. Ten GISTs were diagnosed before the introduction of CD117. The clinical features, tumor characteristics, and treatment were analyzed. Factors predicting tumor related death or recurrence were studied with Cox proportional hazard model. RESULTS:The patients included 26 males and 21 females, with a mean age of 66.6 years (SD 13.1, range 29-87 years). The estimated prevalence of GISTs was 13.4-15.6 per 100,000 people, with an annual incidence of 1.68-1.96 per 100,000 people. The annual incidence of GISTs before and after the introduction of CD117 was 1.1 per 100,000 people and 2.1 per 100,000 people respectively. Stomach (34 patients, 72.3%) was the most common location for the tumor, followed by the small intestine (8 patients, 17.0%), esophagus (2 patients, 4.3%), omentum (2 patients, 4.3%) and colon (1 patient, 2.1%). Thirty-one patients (66%) had complete tumor resection. Eleven out of 16 deaths (23%) were tumor-related. The median survival time was 26 mo. Five-year survival rate was 61.3%. The significant factors associated with tumor-related death or recurrence were incomplete resection, tumor size 5 cm or above, invasion to the adjacent organ or presence of metastasis. CONCLUSION:The incidence of GIST in Hong Kong is comparable to that in the United States but lower than that in Finland. The true incidence of GISTs could be underestimated before the introduction of CD117. Incomplete resection, tumor size 5 cm or above, invasion to the adjacent organ or presence of metastasis are factors predicting tumor-related death or recurrence."
12749974,"The objective of this study is to undertake a population based study on the incidence, prevalence, natural history, and response to treatment of complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). All Mayo Clinic and Olmsted Medical Group medical records with codes for reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD), CRPS, and compatible diagnoses in the period 1989-1999 were reviewed as part of the Rochester Epidemiology Project. We used IASP criteria for CRPS. The study population was in the Olmsted County, Minnesota (1990 population, 106,470). The main outcome measures were CRPS I incidence, prevalence, and outcome. Seventy-four cases of CRPS I were identified, resulting in an incidence rate of 5.46 per 100,000 person years at risk, and a period prevalence of 20.57 per 100,000. Female:male ratio was 4:1, with a median age of 46 years at onset. Upper limb was affected twice as commonly as lower limb. All cases reported an antecedent event and fracture was the most common trigger (46%). Excellent concordance was found between symptoms and signs and vasomotor symptoms were the most commonly present. Three phase bone scan and autonomic testing diagnosed the condition in >80% of cases. Seventy-four percent of patients underwent resolution, often spontaneously. CRPS I is of low prevalence, more commonly affects women than men, the upper more than the lower extremity, and three out of four cases undergo resolution. These results suggest that invasive treatment of CRPS may not be warranted in the majority of cases."
21199472,"OBJECTIVE: To identify the clinical picture of Behcet's disease in a large cohort of patients (6500) in Iran, over a period of 35 years, and compare them with other large series from around the world. METHODS: Patients with Behcet's disease from all over Iran were seen in the Behcet's Disease Research Unit by a multidisciplinary team (rheumatologists, dermatologists, and ophthalmologists). Diagnosis was based on 'expert opinion'. Data were collected on a standardized data sheet (105 items), and stored in an electronic database. Data were updated at each follow-up. RESULTS: Male to female ratio was 1.22 :  .00. The mean age at onset was 26 years ± 11.3. The frequency of symptoms were: oral aphthosis 97.3%, genital aphthosis 64.6%, skin manifestations 64.9% (pseudofolliculitis 54.5%, erythema nodosum 22.5%, other lesions 7%), pathergy phenomenon 52.5%, ophthalmologic manifes-tations 56.8% (anterior uveitis 41.2%, posterior uveitis 44.9%, retinal vasculitis 32.1%), joint manifestations 37.4% (arthralgia 17.2%, monoarticular arthritis 7.6%, oligoarthritis 16.8%, ankylosing spondylitis 2%), neurological manifestations 3.8% (central manifestations 3.5%, mononeuritis multiplex 0.3%), gastrointestinal manifestations 7.4%, vascular involvement 8.3% (phlebitis 5.7%, superficial phlebitis 2.2%, large vein thrombosis 1.1%, arterial thrombosis 0.154%, aneurysm 0.5%), epididymitis 4.7%, cardiac involvement 0.6%, and pulmonary involvement 0.9%. Sedimentation rate was normal in 46.5% of patients. Abnormal urine sediment was detected in 12.2%. HLA-B5 was present in 53.3% and HLA-B51 in 47.9% of patients. CONCLUSION: Behcet's disease is mainly seen in young people. The most frequent symptoms are mucocutaneous, ocular and joint manifestations. Comparison with large series did not show major differences."
19169038,"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of disease subtypes of spinocerebellar degenerations (SCDs) varies between countries, and even between areas within a country. We report unprecedented epidemiologic data on SCDs in the Hokuriku district, which is located in the central, western part of Japan. METHODS: Clinical and genetic data on SCD patients were obtained via questionnaires distributed to all the departments of neurology, psychiatry and internal medicine in the Hokuriku district (n = 418). RESULTS: Among the SCD patients, autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCAs) were noted in 40.4%, multiple system atrophy in 24.7%, cortical cerebellar atrophy in 13.3% and autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia in 0.3%. Genetically confirmed ADCA patients included those with Machado-Joseph disease (MJD)/spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3; 63.3%), SCA6 (20.0%), ADCA linked to chromosome 16q22.1 (10.0%), dentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy (4.4%), SCA1 (1.1%) and SCA2 (1.1%). MJD/SCA3 was highly prevalent in the Toyama prefecture of the Hokuriku district, accounting for 90% of genetically confirmed ADCAs by birthplace; MJD/SCA3 patients were concentrated in the Gosei area, the western part of the Toyama prefecture, giving an estimated prevalence of 19.1 per 100,000 inhabitants. CONCLUSIONS: The Hokuriku district, especially the Gosei area of Toyama, had a surprisingly high relative frequency and prevalence of MJD/SCA3, which is comparable to that in the Azores, Portugal."
18181200,"Polycythemia vera (PV) and essential thrombocythemia (ET) are common types of myeloproliferative disorders (MPD), the prevalence of which has not been well documented in the United States. Recent breakthroughs in the molecular etiology of these disorders and the accelerated development of targeted pharmacotherapeutics to treat them underscore the need to define the affected population. In this study, we obtained health claims data from major commercial insurance payers in Connecticut and the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services to estimate the prevalence of PV and ET. Specifically, logistic regression was utilized to develop algorithms to predict the probability that an individual with claims suggestive of MPD truly has PV or ET, and the algorithms were then applied to health claims to estimate the number of PV and ET patients in Connecticut. As of 2003, the age-standardized prevalence was 22 per 100,000 and 24 per 100,000 for PV and ET, respectively, in Connecticut. Applying the age-specific prevalence of PV and ET to the entire US population resulted in an estimated total of 65,243 patients with PV and 71,078 patients with ET in the United States in 2003. This study is the first to assess the prevalence of PV and ET in a large US population. Given the large number of individuals afflicted with these diseases and the fact that demographic changes alone will further increase the burden of"
21632812,"CONTEXT: Congenital hypothyroidism (CH) is reportedly increasing in the United States, possibly reflecting changes in screening methods. In Québec, the same initial TSH cutoff (15 mU/liter) has been used for the last 20 yr, but in 2001, the cutoff was decreased from 15 to 5 mU/liter for the second test, which is requested when TSH is intermediate (15-30 mU/liter) on the first. OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to assess the incidence of CH over the last 20 yr in Québec. DESIGN, SETTING, PATIENTS, AND MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: This is a population-based retrospective study. Incidences by etiology based on thyroid scintigraphy with technetium were compared between 1990-2000 and 2001-2009. RESULTS: Of 1,660,857 newborns over 20 yr, 620 had CH (incidence 1:2679). Etiology was dysgenesis (n = 389, 1:4270), either ectopy (n = 290) or athyreosis (n = 99), goiter (n = 52, 1:31,940), normal-size gland in situ (n = 115, 1:14,442), and unknown (n = 64, 1:25,950). The new screening algorithm identified 49 additional cases (i.e. 25 normal-size gland in situ, 12 unknown etiology, 10 ectopies, and two goiters). Consequently, the incidence of normal-size gland in situ or of unknown etiology more than doubled (1:22,222 to 1:9,836, P = 0.0015; and 1:43,824 to 1:17,143, P = 0.0018, respectively) but that of dysgenesis and goiter remained stable. Had the 1990-2000 algorithm been applied in 2001-2009, no change in incidence would have been observed in any category. CONCLUSION: Estimating the incidence of CH is influenced by minimal changes in TSH screening cutoffs. Lower cutoffs identify additional cases that have predominantly functional disorders whose impact on intellectual disability, if left untreated, remains to be determined."
17582741,"An epidemiologic study of the autoimmune diseases taken together has not been done heretofore. The National Patient Register of Denmark is used to estimate the population prevalence of 31 possible or probable autoimmune diseases. Record linkage is used to estimate 465 pairwise co-morbidities in individuals among the 31 diseases, and familial aggregation among sibs, parents and offspring. The prevalence of any of the 31 diseases in the population is more than 5%. Within individuals, there is extensive comorbidity across the 31 diseases. Within families, aggregation is strongest for individual diseases and weak across diseases. These data confirm the importance of the autoimmune diseases as a group and suggest that common etiopathologies exist among them."
26558363,"The population-based epidemiology of Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS), a rare disease of hepatic venous outflow obstruction, is largely unknown. This study aimed to elucidate the nationwide population-based incidence, prevalence, complications, case fatalities and direct medical cost of BCS in South Korea from 2009 to 2013.Using two large data sources, the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service Claims database and Rare Intractable Disease registration program database in Korea, we identified all patients with BCS who were registered under International Classification of Diseases 10 (code I82.0). The age- and sex-adjusted incidence and prevalence of BCS were calculated with analysis of complications and direct medical costs.A total of 424 patients with BCS were identified in 2009-2013, with a female-to-male ratio of 1.8 and a median age of 51 years old. The average age- and sex-adjusted incidence from 2011 to 2013 was 0.87 per million per year, and the average age- and sex-adjusted prevalence from 2009 to 2013 was 5.29 per million population. Among them, 10.3% accompanied liver cancer and 3.3% underwent liver transplantation. Annual case-fatality rate was 2.8%. Direct medical costs excluding uninsured services for BCS increased by year from 385 720 USD in 2009 to 765 983 USD in 2013.This is the first population-based study on the epidemiology of BCS in an Asian country, which presented a higher prevalence than in Western studies. It suggests early diagnosis or improved prognosis of BCS in recent years, and clinical features of BCS that differ by geography."
22683754,"OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the current study was to screen newborns in Greece and to identify the responsible mutations for Medium-Chain Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase Deficiency (MCADD). DESIGN AND METHODS: 47.812 neonates were screened for the potential presence of MCADD in Greece, via a LC-MS/MS protocol. The ""suspected"" samples were subjected to genetic testing via PCR-RFLP and sequencing of the coding region of the ACADM gene. Urine samples were collected and then analyzed with a GC/MS method. RESULTS: The MCADD prevalence is 1 in 15,937 births. The alleles c.985A>G and c.245insT were detected in the 29.2% and 20.8% of the ""suspected"" cohort, respectively. A novel variant with potential pathogenicity was identified. CONCLUSIONS: The c.245insT allele seems to prevail in the Greek cohort of ""suspected"" specimens. Therefore, this variant along with the c.985A>G allele could constitute a panel for both prenatal and neonatal MCADD screening in the Greek population."
12358264,"OBJECTIVE: There is limited information on the prevalence of autoimmune liver disease in nonwhite populations. We conducted a population-based study on the prevalence of autoimmune liver diseases in Alaska natives. METHODS: Clinical records from 1984 to July, 2000 were reviewed to identify Alaska natives with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), primary sclerosing cholangitis, autoimmune cholangitis, and overlap syndromes of two of the above. AIH was defined as definite or probable, based on criteria established by the International Autoimmune Hepatitis Group. The diagnosis of PBC was based on a positive antimitochondrial antibody of > or = 1: 40, biochemical evidence of cholestasis, and compatible liver biopsy. Autoimmune cholangitis was defined as PBC but without a positive antimitochondrial antibody. Primary sclerosing cholangitis was diagnosed on the basis of cholangiogram. RESULTS: Seventy-seven patients with possible autoimmune liver disease were identified. Of these, 42 had definite and seven probable AIH. At presentation, 34.7% of patients with AIH presented with acute icteric hepatitis, and 65.3% were asymptomatic. Persons presenting with mild or no symptoms were more likely to have moderate to severe fibrosis on liver biopsy than those presenting with jaundice. Eighteen persons were diagnosed with PBC, five with autoimmune cholangitis, five with overlap syndrome, and none with primary sclerosing cholangitis. The combined point prevalence of AIH Alaska natives was 42.9/100,000 (95% CI = 31-57.7). The prevalence of PBC was 16/100,000 (95% CI = 12.9-25.4). CONCLUSIONS: This population-based study demonstrates that the prevalence rates of AIH and PBC in Alaska natives are comparable with reported rates in other populations."
10359408,"BACKGROUND:The best method for prevention and control of congenital toxoplasma infection is uncertain. Prenatal screening is done in Austria and France, but the effect of treatment during pregnancy is not well documented. The aim of our study was to find out the maternofetal transmission rate and outcome in infants born to mothers who were not treated during pregnancy. METHODS:We analysed 89873 eluates from phenylketonuria (PKU) cards from neonates and paired first-trimester serum samples from the mothers for specific IgG antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii. Children born to mothers who seroconverted during pregnancy were followed-up clinically and serologically to 12 months of age. In addition, 21144 PKU cards were analysed for toxoplasma-specific IgM antibodies during the last 12 months of the study. FINDINGS:In 24989 (27.8%) cases both the PKU eluate and the first-trimester samples were IgG positive, which indicates previous maternal infection. 139 of the 64884 seronegative women acquired toxoplasma infection during pregnancy and gave birth to 141 infants (two sets of twins). 27 of these children were diagnosed with congenital toxoplasma infection. The transmission rate was 19.4% (95% CI 13.2-27.0). Clinical signs and symptoms were found in four (15%) of the 27 children. The additional analysis for toxoplasma-specific IgM antibodies from the PKU card identified seven of nine children with congenital toxoplasma infection. The false-positive rate for the IgM test was 0.19 per 1000, and no false-negatives were found. INTERPRETATION:The risks of transmission of infection and of disease in the infant are low in an area with a low risk of toxoplasma infection. A neonatal screening programme based on detection of toxoplasma-specific IgM antibodies alone will identify between 70% and 80% of cases of congenital toxoplasmosis."
19060277,"PURPOSE: The study was initiated to investigate the mutation spectrum of four OCA genes and to calculate the birth prevalence in patients with autosomal recessive albinism. METHODS: Mutation analysis using dHPLC or direct DNA sequencing of TYR, OCA2, TYRP1, and MATP was performed in 62 patients. Furthermore, 15 patients were investigated for mutations in SLC24A5. Allele expression was investigated in heterozygous patients by RT-PCR analysis. The birth prevalence was calculated based on retrospective data from a compulsory national register. RESULTS: Sixty-two patients were investigated for mutations. Two mutations in one OCA gene explained oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) in 44% of the patients. Mutations in TYR were found in 26% of patients, while OCA2 and MATP caused OCA in 15% and 3%, respectively. No mutations were found in TYRP1. Of the remaining 56% of patients, 29% were heterozygous for a mutation in either TYR or OCA2, and 27% were without mutations in any of the four genes. Exclusive expression of the mutant allele was found in four heterozygous patients. A minimum birth prevalence of 1 in 14,000 was calculated, based on register data on 218 patients. The proportion of OCA to autosomal recessive ocular albinism (AROA) based on clinical findings was 55 to 45. CONCLUSIONS: TYR is the major OCA gene in Denmark, but several patients do not have mutations in the investigated genes. A relatively large fraction of patients were observed with AROA, and of those 52% had no mutations compared with 15% of those with OCA."
27214746,"To investigate the epidemiology and mortality in patients with biopsy-proven giant cell arteritis (GCA) in northern Italy.All patients with incident temporal-artery biopsy-positive GCA, diagnosed between 1986 and 2012 and living in the Reggio Emilia area, were identified by using a pathology register and by reviewing all histopathologic specimens. For each patient, we identified 1 comparison subject from the same geographic area, matched for age and sex. Mortality rates and specific causes of death were reported.There were 285 incident cases of biopsy-proven GCA (210 women) during the 26-year study period. The overall age- and sex-adjusted incidence per 100,000 persons ages ≥50 years was 5.8 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 5.1, 6.5). Incidence was significantly higher in women (7.8 [95% CI 6.7, 8.9]) than in men (3.3 [95% CI 2.6, 4.1]) (P < 0.0001). Annual age- and sex-adjusted incidence rates significantly increased by 15.9% per 3 years from 1986 to 2000, then significantly fell by -4.8% per 3 years from 2001-2012. The prevalence of GCA on December 31, 2012 was 87.9 (95% CI 75.8, 101.4). No significant differences in the mortality rates were observed between GCA patients (4.9 per 100 person-years [95% CI 4.1, 5.8]) and non-GCA subjects (5.6 [95% CI 4.7, 6.6]). No significant differences in causes of death were observed comparing GCA patients to non-GCA subjects.This large population-based study of biopsy-proven GCA confirmed the lower incidence of GCA in Mediterranean countries and did not observe any increased mortality risk."
22722209,"OBJECTIVES: Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder characterized by involuntary movements and psychiatric disturbances, found worldwide, with a variable prevalence. The purpose of this study was to determine the history of HD in Iceland and determine the prevalence and incidence of HD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical information was obtained from general, neurologic, and psychiatric hospitals, practicing neurologists, general practitioners, and family members of affected individuals. RESULTS: Twenty-seven individuals were identified with typical symptoms of HD from the 1850s to 2007. All but one sporadic case are descendants of a husband and wife living in the early and mid-19th century. The point prevalence of HD in Iceland is 1.0 per 100,000 individuals. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of HD in Iceland is markedly lower than in the neighboring countries (Norway and the British Isles), where Icelanders originate from."
25689972,"Huntington disease (HD) prevalence shows geographic variability and has been recently updated by taking into account the mutation diagnostic test. In Italy, the last epidemiological estimation was reported well before the HTT gene discovery and the availability of the corresponding genetic test. It reported a prevalence of affected subjects ranging between 2.3 and 4.8/100,000 in some restricted areas of Northern Italy. We have performed a service-based epidemiological analysis in a very restricted geographic area named Molise, where our institutions currently operate and represent the only point of reference for rare neuropsychiatric diseases. The estimated prevalence rate found was 10.85/100,000 (95% confidence interval (CI): 7.20-14.50), remarkably higher than that previously described before the gene test analysis was available, and expected to an increase of an additional 17% by 2030, because of Italian population aging. According to our analysis, we estimate that about 6500 subjects are currently affected by HD in Italy, and that this number will further increase in the next decades because of population aging, variable phenotype penetrance and improved life expectancy."
10095814,"INTRODUCTION:Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a dominantly inherited disease characterized by telangiectatic lesions. The disease manifestations are variable and include epistaxis, gastrointestinal bleeding, pulmonary arteriovenous malformations and cerebral arteriovenous malformations. Early death due to these complications has been described. DESIGN:We report a study on the prevalence and mortality of HHT in a Danish population based on two cross-sectional surveys in combination with a long-term follow-up study. SETTINGS AND SUBJECTS:Prevalent cases of HHT as of 1 January 1974 in the County of Fyn, Denmark, were identified. In 1995-97 a follow-up study of mortality was performed of the initial patient sample, and a new point prevalence rate of HHT as of 1 January 1995 was calculated. All live patients and their families were invited to attend a detailed clinical examination. RESULTS:The prevalence of HHT in the County of Fyn was 13.8 per 100,000 on 1 January 1974 and 15.6 per 100,000 on 1 January 1995. In the HHT group as a whole, we found a slightly increased mortality; however, amongst the HHT patients younger than 60 years at inclusion the mortality of HHT patients was twice the expected. The excess mortality could be fully explained by severe HHT symptoms. CONCLUSION:This study suggests that HHT is more prevalent than previously believed. In young patients the disease is associated with an excess mortality which is fully attributable to HHT. Future research should aim at the identification of HHT patients at particular risk of developing severe complications."
15516165,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the relationship between oral clefts and demographic and clinical factors in Hawaii. METHODS: Data were obtained from a birth defects registry and included all infants and fetuses with oral clefts delivered during 1986 through 2000. Subjects were categorized as total, isolated, and nonisolated cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL+/-P) or cleft palate without cleft lip (CP). RESULTS: There were 352 total subjects of CL+/-P and 192 total subjects of CP with corresponding rates per 10,000 live births of 12.5 for CL+/-P and 6.8 for CP. Total, isolated, and nonisolated CL+/-P rates demonstrated no clear pattern by maternal age. The total and nonisolated CP rates tended to be higher among older maternal age groups. The total CL+/-P rate was higher among Far East Asians, Pacific Islanders, and Filipinos than among whites. The total CP rate was higher among Far East Asians and Pacific Islanders than among whites, whereas the rate for Filipinos was lower than for whites. The total CL+/-P rate was substantially lower among females (rate ratio 0.62, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.49 to 0.77) and the total CP rate substantially higher among females (rate ratio 1.52, 95% CI = 1.13 to 2.06). Both CL+/-P and CP were more common with lower birth weight and gestational age among the total, isolated, and nonisolated groups. CONCLUSIONS: Oral cleft risk was associated with maternal race/ethnicity, sex, birth weight, and gestational age. Although some of the observed associations were consistent with the literature, others were not."
17129379,"Early onset torsion dystonia (EOTD) is a rare movement disorder characterized by involuntary, repetitive, sustained muscle contractions or postures involving one or more sites of the body. A US study estimated the prevalence at approximately 1 in 30,000. The estimated prevalence in the general population of Europe seems to be lower, ranging from 1 in 330,000 to 1 in 200,000, although precise numbers are currently not available. The estimated prevalence in the Ashkenazi Jewish population is approximately five to ten times higher, due to a founder mutation. Symptoms of EOTD typically develop first in an arm or leg in middle to late childhood and progress in approximately 30% of patients to other body regions (generalized dystonia) within about five years. Distribution and severity of symptoms vary widely between affected individuals. The majority of cases from various ethnic groups are caused by an autosomal dominantly inherited deletion of 3 bp (GAG) in the DYT1 gene on chromosome 9q34. This gene encodes a protein named torsinA, which is presumed to act as a chaperone protein associated with the endoplasmic reticulum and the nuclear envelope. It may interact with the dopamine transporter and participate in intracellular trafficking, although its precise function within the cell remains to be determined. Molecular genetic diagnostic and genetic counseling is recommended for individuals with age of onset below 26 years, and may also be considered in those with onset after 26 years having a relative with typical early onset dystonia. Treatment options include botulinum toxin injections for focal symptoms, pharmacological therapy such as anticholinergics (most commonly trihexiphenydil) for generalized dystonia and surgical approaches such as deep brain stimulation of the internal globus pallidus or intrathecal baclofen application in severe cases. All patients have normal cognitive function, and despite a high rate of generalization of dystonia, 75% of those patients are able to maintain ambulation and independence, and therefore a comparatively good quality of life, with modern treatment modalities."
16492624,"PURPOSE: To investigate the incidence, clinical presentation and associated comorbidities of Angelman syndrome (AS) in Western Australia, with establishment of an information database for the disorder. METHODS: Data were collected from Disability Services Commission files, supplemented by datasets provided by the Western Australian Data Linkage Unit. The analysis was retrospective and quantitative. RESULTS: Thirty-four individuals (two deceased) were identified (19 F, 15 M), with a mean age of 21.6 years; 52.9% had an IQ < 40, with the remainder of IQ 40-69. The incidence was one in 40,000 births and mean age at diagnosis was 5.8 years. The mean age of the 23 home residents was 20.2 years compared to 27.9 years in the nine individuals in sheltered accommodation. In general, the patients exhibited a typical AS clinical presentation. A median of 5.5 (range 0-20) hospital admissions was recorded per person, with epilepsy, gastrointestinal disorders, and dental work all common reasons for admission. CONCLUSIONS: The estimated incidence was low compared to other reports, as was the proportion of IQ < 40. AS cases required substantial levels of medical care, especially those who were epileptic. An increase in the future numbers of AS patients needing sheltered accommodation is predicted."
18344207,"Craniosynostosis is a birth defect characterized by premature fusion of one or more cranial sutures. We describe the birth prevalence of craniosynostosis and related risk factors among infants born to residents of metropolitan Atlanta during 1989-2003. Data from the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program (MACDP) were used to identify infants with craniosynostosis. Case records with a code for craniosynostosis were reviewed to substantiate the diagnosis of craniosynostosis and to classify infants as having isolated craniosynostosis (no other unrelated major defects), multiple defects (one or more additional major, unrelated defects), or a syndrome (recognized or strongly suspected single-gene condition or chromosome abnormality). Vital records data on births of Georgia residents were used to analyze craniosynostosis prevalence by year of birth, maternal race and age, parity, plurality, and infants' sex, birth weight, and gestational age. We identified 281 infants born with craniosynostosis in metropolitan Atlanta during 1989-2003: 84% with isolated craniosynostosis, 7% with multiple defects, and 9% with syndromes. The birth prevalence was 4.3 per 10,000 births, results consistent with findings from other population-based studies using similar case definitions. Apert syndrome was diagnosed in 40% of the syndromic cases, and sagittal synostosis was diagnosed in 39% of the cases of nonsyndromic craniosynostosis. Maternal age 35 years or older, multiple birth, male sex, and birth weight >4,000 g were risk factors for craniosynostosis."
10820168,"X-linked nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) is a rare disease caused by mutations in the arginine vasopressin receptor 2 gene (AVPR2). Thirty-three novel AVPR2 mutations were identified in 62 families that were not included in our previous studies. This study describes the diversity of mutations observed in a total of 117 families, the number of affected people at the time of diagnosis, skewed X chromosome inactivation in severely affected females, the inferred parental origin of de novo mutations, and it provides estimates of incidence. Among 117 families, there were 82 different putative disease-causing mutations. Based on haplotype analysis, it can be inferred that when the same AVPR2 mutation is identified in different families that were not known to be related, the mutations most likely arose independently. More than half of the families had only one affected male; two families presented with a severely affected female and no family history of NDI. A de novo mutation arose during oogenesis in the mother in 20% of isolated cases. The estimate of about 8.8 per million male live births of the incidence of X-linked NDI in the province of Quebec, Canada may be representative of the general population except in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, where the incidence is more than six times higher. Documentation of the diversity of mutations will assist in revealing the full spectrum of clinical variation. Discussion of genetic and population genetic aspects of X-linked NDI may contribute to early diagnosis and treatment."
24502439,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: The prevalence of Primary biliary cirrhosis varies in different geographical areas. This might reflect genetic or environmental risk factors. We aimed to define Primary biliary cirrhosis prevalence and incidence, describe patient's spatial distribution, generate prediction maps and detect any possible routing pattern of time-spatial appearance of the disease in Crete, Greece. METHODS: From 1990-2010, 245 Primary biliary cirrhosis patients diagnosed and followed up at the Gastroenterology Department of the University Hospital and the District Hospitals of the island, were contacted and 222 were included in the time-spatial analysis. To map their spatial distribution per 5-year periods, geospatial models were applied in Gis-ArcMap 9.3 software. Kriging Interpolation methods were used to generate prediction maps for the disease in Crete. Areas of high and low probability of disease occurrence were estimated through multicriteria modelling. The disease route was defined by Gis-ArcMap's toolbox. RESULTS: Prevalence was found to be 365 cases per million, with a mean incidence of 20.88 (range 3.79-35.99). Prediction map estimates from 1.22 to 11 patients per 50 km2 all over Crete. Areas of high risk of disease occurrence are located in the Eastern part, while low risk in the Western part of the island. DISCUSSION: Prevalence and incidence of Primary biliary cirrhosis in Crete are among the higher published in Europe. Given the homogeneous and stable study population and the geopolitics of the island, the heterogeneity in the time-spatial distribution and the route of disease appearance strongly suggest a role for environmental causative agents."
1369611,"Myotonic dystrophy (MD) or Steinert's disease is the most frequent hereditary myopathy in the adult. The aim of this study was to determine the rate of prevalence of MD on the island of Mallorca. Patients diagnosed with MD were studied in all public and private surgeries and centres able to diagnose this disease on the island of Mallorca. Therefore, this study included the whole population of Mallorca (551,129 inhabitants). A total of 60 cases were studied representing a prevalence rate of 110 cases per one million inhabitants. The patients were further classified according to the existence of family history and were geographically located into the different towns. The prevalence rate found was much higher than that described in the literature which oscillates between 30 and 50 cases per million inhabitants. Furthermore, there was a concentration of cases in 10 of the 52 towns of the island with the presence of 2 cases in 6 being significant. The rate of prevalence of the disease in the city of Palma (295,136 inhabitants) representing more than half of the population of the island was very similar (120 per million) to that found for the population as a whole."
17229609,"A retrospective epidemiological survey of generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP) was carried out in France in 2005. 121 dermatological wards received a questionnaire concerning the patients treated in 2004. It related to demographic data, morbidity, mortality, failures and the therapeutic practices of each ward. CNAMTS, the main French health insurance, was also questioned about its registry concerning GPP.112 wards (92.5%) answered the questionnaire, totalling 99 cases (sex ratio male/female: 0.77, mean age 52.5 years +/- 18), which were handled by 46 wards. Incidence and prevalence were estimated in 2004 at a minimum of 0.64 and 1.76/million respectively. Incidence deduced from the CNAMTS data in 1998 and 2001 was similar. The treatment habits were the same in the 46 wards, which used acitretin as first line treatment (89%), followed by methotrexate (8%). High potency dermatocorticosteroids (DC) were most often used (87%). Complications and death were noted in 17% and 2% of the cases respectively, recalcitrant GPP in 42%. Immunobiologics were required in 13% of patients. Univariate analysis showed that treatment failure was related to: i) management in a university ward (OR: 2.9, p = 0.03) probably reflecting the management of the more severe cases ii) prescription of high or very high potency DC as first line local therapy (OR: 7.6, p = 0.05) iii) therapies other than retinoids as first line systemic therapy (OR: 5.5, p = 0.04). The systemic treatment is well codified but future studies will have to confirm the usefulness of DC in the management of GPP."
28666455,"Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) is a rare, severely disabling, and life-shortening genetic disorder that causes the formation of heterotopic bone within soft connective tissue. Previous studies found that the FOP prevalence was about one in every two million lives. The aim of this study is to estimate the FOP prevalence in France by probabilistic record-linkage of 2 national databases: 1) the PMSI (Programme de médicalisation des systèmes d'information), an administrative database that records all hospitalization activities in France and 2) CEMARA, a registry database developed by the French Centres of Reference for Rare Diseases.Using a capture-recapture methodology to adjust the crude number of patients identified in both data sources, 89 FOP patients were identified, which results in a prevalence of 1.36 per million inhabitants (CI95% = [1.10; 1.68]). FOP patients' mean age was 25 years, only 14.9% were above 40 years, and 53% of them were males. The first symptoms - beside toe malformations- occurred after birth for 97.3% of them. Mean age at identified symptoms was 7 years and above 18 years for only 6.9% of patients. Mean age at diagnosis was 10 years, and above 18 years for 14.9% of the patients. FOP patients were distributed across France.Despite the challenge of ascertaining patients with rare diseases, we report a much higher prevalence of FOP in France than in previous studies elsewhere. We suggest that efforts to identify patients and confirm the diagnosis of FOP should be reinforced and extended at both national and European level."
21546779,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine prevalence and 15-year survival in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT). METHODS: The study covers the period from 1 January 1988 to 31 December 2007 in the territory of Belgrade. Data on a number of CMT-affected persons and their basic demographic characteristics as well as data on the disease were collected from medical records. Data on the course and outcome of the disease were obtained through direct contact with patients, their families and their physicians. RESULTS: We registered 161 patients with CMT in the population of Belgrade. The most frequent type was CMT1. The crude prevalence of CMT disease in the Belgrade population on 31 December 2007 was 9.7/100,000 for all subtypes, 7.1/100,000 for CMT1, and 2.3/100,000 for CMT2. Gender-specific prevalence was 11.2/100,000 for males and 8.3/100,000 for females. The highest age-specific prevalence was registered in the oldest age group (75+ years; 19.1/100,000), and the lowest one in patients aged 5-14 years (5.0/100,000). The cumulative probability of 15-year survival for CMT patients in Belgrade was 85.6 ± 7.8% (44.9 ± 31.8% for males and 98.2 ± 1.8% for females). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of CMT found in Belgrade is similar to the prevalence registered in Southern European countries."
15275696,"During the last 5 years 2057 children under the age of 5 with various neurologic symptoms with the suspected diagnosis of lysosomal storage diseases were referred to our hospital from different universities and state hospitals. We were able to separate sphingolipidoses by lysosomal enzyme screening. A total of 300 patients (15%) with sphingolipidoses were diagnosed; there were deficiencies of arylsulfatase A [metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD)] in 93 (31%), hexosaminidase [Sandhoff disease (SHD)] in 62 (20.7%), hexosaminidase A [Tay-Sachs disease (TSD)] in 15 (5%), beta-galactosidase (GM1 gangliosidosis) in 35 (11.7%), alpha-galactosidase (Fabry disease) in one (0.3%) cerebroside beta-galactosidase (Krabbe disease) in 65 (21.7%) and glucosylceramidase (Gaucher disease) in 29 (9.6%). SHD (20.7%), MLD (31%) and Krabbe disease (21.7%) were common. Prenatal enzymatic diagnosis was made in 70 at risk pregnancies, 64 for TSD and SHD, three for MLD and three for GM1 gangliosidosis by using chorionic villus biopsy in 54, cord blood samples in 12 and cultured amniotic fluid cells in four. Seventeen fetuses were found to be affected. We have calculated the relative frequency and minimum incidence of sphingolipidoses in Turkey. The combined incidence of sphingolipidoses is 4.615 per 100,000 live births. The calculated incidences are 1.43, 0.95, 1, 0.23, 0.54, 0.45, 0.015 per 100,000 live births for MLD, SHD, Krabbe, Gaucher, TSD, GM1 gangliosidosis and Fabry diseases, respectively. The real incidence, which covers all subtypes of this group of diseases, should be greater than this number. The results suggested that, as a group, sphingolipidoses are relatively common and represent an important health problem in Turkey and some rare autosomal recessive diseases of Turkey are due to 'founder effect' created by consanguineous marriages."
2511318,"A population based study of von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis in south east Wales (population 668,100) identified 69 families with 135 affected members (prevalence 1/4950 of the population). In these families penetrance of the NF-1 gene was 100% by the age of five years. The genetic fitness of NF-1 sufferers was found to be reduced to 0.47, the effect being more marked in males than females (f = 0.31 and 0.60, respectively). Forty-one of 135 cases were judged to represent new disease mutations and the mutation rate was estimated to lie between 3.1 x 10(-5) and 10.4 x 10(-5). A parental age effect for new mutations was not found, nor was a maternal effect on disease severity."
20138303,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prevalence at live birth of congenital heart disease (CHD) in Taiwan. STUDY DESIGN: Patients with CHD born from 2000 to 2006 were identified from National Health Insurance databases. RESULTS: CHD prevalence was 13.08 per 1000 live births: 12.05 (simple, 10.53; severe, 1.51) in male infants and 14.21 (simple, 12.90; severe, 1.32) in female infants. Ventricular septal defect (VSD; 4.0) was the most common defect, followed by secundum atrial septal defect (ASDII; 3.2), patent ductus arteriosus (PDA; 2.0), pulmonary stenosis (PS; 1.2), tetralogy of Fallot (TOF; 0.63), coarctation of aorta (CoA; 0.25), transposition of great arteries (TGA; 0.21), endocardial cushion defect (ECD; 0.20), double outlet of right ventricle (DORV; 0.15), total anomalous pulmonary venous return (TAPVR; 0.11), aortic stenosis (0.09), hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS; 0.062), Ebstein anomaly (0.047), and tricuspid atresia (0.046). Female predominance was observed in VSD, ASDII, PDA, and ECD; and male predominance was observed in TGA and TOF. Ratios of western prevalence to our Asian prevalence were high for HLHS (3.68-4.5), CoA (1.13-1.96), TGA (1.09-1.83), and tricuspid atresia (1.09-2.57), but low for PS (0.15-0.99), TOF (0.41-0.92), and possibly ASDII. CONCLUSIONS: In this Asian population, the prevalence of CHD was at the high end of the reported range, with more PS and TOF, but fewer left-sided obstructions, TGA, and tricuspid atresia."
19551311,"INTRODUCTION: Turner syndrome is the most common sex chromosomal abnormality in female foetuses, and is associated with a high proportion of cardiac anomalies. The aim of this study was to look at the incidence, demographical data and epidemiological pattern of Turner syndrome in Singapore from 1999 to 2004 and to examine the birth defects associated with this condition, specifically with reference to cardiac defects. METHODS: Data on Turner syndrome cases born in 1999-2004 were retrieved from the National Birth Defects Registry (NBDR) and analysed. Data on congenital cardiac defect cases notified to the NBDR in the same time period were also retrieved and compared with the Turner syndrome cases. RESULTS: There were a total of 101 cases of Turner syndrome in the six-year period from 1999-2004, yielding an overall incidence of 0.85 per 1,000 female live births, or one in 1,180 female live births. The incidence was lowest among Indians (0.38 per 1,000) compared to Malays (0.72 per 1,000) and Chinese (0.90 per 1,000). 75 cases (74.3 percent) had the 45,X karyotype, while the other 26 cases (25.7 percent) were mosaics. The mean maternal age for 45,X was lower (32.2 years, range 22-42) compared to mosaics (34.5 years, range 27-40). 19.8 percent (20/101) were live births, 38.6 percent (39/101) were terminated pregnancies and 41.6 percent (42/101) were spontaneous miscarriages. 13.9 percent of Turner syndrome babies had cardiac defects compared to 1.2 percent in the general population (p-value is less than 0.0001). Major cardiac defects found among Turner syndrome babies compared to the general population included the coarctation of the aorta (5.9 percent compared to 0.03 percent, p-value is less than 0.0001), atrial septal defects (3.0 percent compared to 0.6 percent, p-value is 0.006), a hypoplastic left heart (2.0 percent compared to 0.05 percent, p-value is less than 0.0001), aortic hypoplasia (3.0 percent compared to 0.01 percent, p-value is less than 0.0001) and dextrocardia (1.0 percent compared to 0.02 percent, p-value is 0.0002). CONCLUSION: Cardiac defects, particularly left-sided ones, are significantly more common among Turner syndrome foetuses. The true incidence of this syndrome is likely to be higher than that quoted in this study, and can only be solved when a complete screening of an entire population has been performed."
7921471,"Little epidemiologic data are available on the occurrence of interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) in the general population. To describe the prevalence and incidence of ILDs a population-based registry of patients with ILDs was established in Bernalillo County, New Mexico in October 1988. All patients 18 yr of age and older who had a clinical diagnosis of an ILD were identified during the period 10/1/88 through 9/30/90 from physician referrals, hospital discharge diagnoses, histopathology reports, and death certificates. In addition, the prevalence of preclinical or undiagnosed cases was identified by screening lung specimens from 510 autopsy cases. A total of 2,936 referrals were screened; 8.8% were prevalent cases and 6.9% were incident cases. Overall, the prevalence of ILDs was 20% higher in males (80.9 per 100,000) than in females (67.2 per 100,000). Similarly the overall incidence of ILDs was slightly more common in males (31.5 per 100,000/year) than females (26.1 per 100,000/year). The estimated prevalence of preclinical or undiagnosed ILDs among all deaths was 1.8%. The most common incident diagnosed among both sexes were pulmonary fibrosis and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, together accounting for 46.2% of all ILD diagnoses in males and 44.2% in females. We conclude that the occurrence of ILDs in the general population may be more common than previous estimates based on selected populations, and these disorders may frequently be unrecognized."
21567387,"BACKGROUND: Small cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder (SCCB) is difficult to characterize and study because of its rarity. For the current study, a large population-based database was used to address ill-defined clinical parameters for this disease. METHODS: The authors analyzed the incidence, sociodemographics, prognostic variables, and treatment trends of this cancer in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) limited database (1991-2005). The SEER-Medicare database (1991-2005) was used to estimate chemotherapy use. RESULTS: There were 642 patients in the SEER limited dataset. From 1991 to 2005, the incidence of SCCB increased significantly from 0.05 to 0.14 cases per 100,000 population (P < .01; approximately 500 new cases of SCCB per year, representing 0.7% of all bladder malignancies). The median overall survival was 11 months. Elderly Caucasian men were the most commonly affected (ratio of Caucasians to non-Caucasians, 10:1; ratio of men to women, 3:1; median age, 73 years). Age, race, marital status, and TNM staging were identified as independent prognostic variables (P < .05). Patients who had stage IV disease without distant metastasis (ie, positive lymph node status) had overall and cancer-specific survival rates similar to those of patients who had stage I through III disease, but they had significantly better survival compared with patients who had distant metastasis (P < .0001). Transurethral resection of the bladder tumor became the most common surgical treatment (P < .0001), representing 55% of patients from 2001 to 2005. The receipt of radiation and chemotherapy did not change significantly during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: These comprehensive data delineated the patient population for this rare disease, described several independent prognostic variables, and demonstrated clear treatment trends for this disease. The results suggest that a simpler staging system (ie, limited stage vs extensive stage) may be appropriate for patients with SCCB."
21388247,"OBJECTIVES: There have been few nationwide population studies of systemic sclerosis (SSc). We describe the epidemiological features of SSc in Taiwan. METHODS: The catastrophic illness registry of the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Dataset (NHIRD) and the National Death Registry of Taiwan were used to calculate estimates of the incidence, prevalence, and mortality of SSc. RESULTS: A total of 1479 persons (325 males, 1154 females) with incident SSc were enrolled in the study. The annual incidence of SSc in Taiwan was found to be 10.9 cases (4.7 males, 17.4 females) per million population. During 2002-2007, the mean prevalence was 56.3 cases per million population. There were 204 deaths (70 males, 134 females) during the study period; 1-, 2-, and 5-year survival rates were 94.9, 92.0, and 83.2%, respectively. SSc patients had a standardized mortality ratio (SMR) of 3.24 [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.82-3.71] for all-cause mortality, as compared with the national population in 2002. There was excess mortality from neoplasms (SMR 1.50, 95% CI 1.03-2.11), cardiovascular diseases (2.23, 1.52-3.16), kidney disease (4.67, 2.66-7.64), gastrointestinal diseases (2.50, 1.27-4.46), and pulmonary diseases (3.20, 1.89-5.09). In addition to male sex and older age, cancer and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) diagnosis were risk factors for death, with hazard ratios (HRs) of 2.71 (95% CI 1.27-5.76) and 2.59 (1.14-5.90), respectively. CONCLUSION: SSc patients had a threefold greater risk of all-cause mortality than the general population of Taiwan. Male sex, older age, diagnosis of cancer, and ESRD were risk factors for death."
12794783,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the incidence of juvenile dermatomyositis (juvenile DM) in the United States between 1995 and 1998. METHODS: Physician referrals to the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases Juvenile Dermatomyositis Research Registry and the National Pediatric Rheumatology Disease Registry from Indiana University were utilized for a 2-source capture-recapture estimation of Juvenile DM annual incidence. RESULTS: For children 2-17 years of age, the estimated annual incidence rates from 1995 to 1998 in the US ranged from 2.5 to 4.1 juvenile DM cases per million children, and the 4-year average annual rate was 3.2 per million children (95% confidence interval 2.9-3.4). Estimated annual incidence rates by race were 3.4 for white non-Hispanics, 3.3 for African American non-Hispanics, and 2.7 for Hispanics. During the 4-year period of the study, completeness of ascertainment for the combined registries ranged from 56% to 86% and girls were affected more than boys (ratio 2.3:1). CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence for sex, and possibly racial differences in the risk of juvenile DM in the US."
21599942,"Glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency (G6P deficiency), or glycogen storage disease type I (GSDI), is a group of inherited metabolic diseases, including types Ia and Ib, characterized by poor tolerance to fasting, growth retardation and hepatomegaly resulting from accumulation of glycogen and fat in the liver. Prevalence is unknown and annual incidence is around 1/100,000 births. GSDIa is the more frequent type, representing about 80% of GSDI patients. The disease commonly manifests, between the ages of 3 to 4 months by symptoms of hypoglycemia (tremors, seizures, cyanosis, apnea). Patients have poor tolerance to fasting, marked hepatomegaly, growth retardation (small stature and delayed puberty), generally improved by an appropriate diet, osteopenia and sometimes osteoporosis, full-cheeked round face, enlarged kydneys and platelet dysfunctions leading to frequent epistaxis. In addition, in GSDIb, neutropenia and neutrophil dysfunction are responsible for tendency towards infections, relapsing aphtous gingivostomatitis, and inflammatory bowel disease. Late complications are hepatic (adenomas with rare but possible transformation into hepatocarcinoma) and renal (glomerular hyperfiltration leading to proteinuria and sometimes to renal insufficiency). GSDI is caused by a dysfunction in the G6P system, a key step in the regulation of glycemia. The deficit concerns the catalytic subunit G6P-alpha (type Ia) which is restricted to expression in the liver, kidney and intestine, or the ubiquitously expressed G6P transporter (type Ib). Mutations in the genes G6PC (17q21) and SLC37A4 (11q23) respectively cause GSDIa and Ib. Many mutations have been identified in both genes,. Transmission is autosomal recessive. Diagnosis is based on clinical presentation, on abnormal basal values and absence of hyperglycemic response to glucagon. It can be confirmed by demonstrating a deficient activity of a G6P system component in a liver biopsy. To date, the diagnosis is most commonly confirmed by G6PC (GSDIa) or SLC37A4 (GSDIb) gene analysis, and the indications of liver biopsy to measure G6P activity are getting rarer and rarer. Differential diagnoses include the other GSDs, in particular type III (see this term). However, in GSDIII, glycemia and lactacidemia are high after a meal and low after a fast period (often with a later occurrence than that of type I). Primary liver tumors and Pepper syndrome (hepatic metastases of neuroblastoma) may be evoked but are easily ruled out through clinical and ultrasound data. Antenatal diagnosis is possible through molecular analysis of amniocytes or chorionic villous cells. Pre-implantatory genetic diagnosis may also be discussed. Genetic counseling should be offered to patients and their families. The dietary treatment aims at avoiding hypoglycemia (frequent meals, nocturnal enteral feeding through a nasogastric tube, and later oral addition of uncooked starch) and acidosis (restricted fructose and galactose intake). Liver transplantation, performed on the basis of poor metabolic control and/or hepatocarcinoma, corrects hypoglycemia, but renal involvement may continue to progress and neutropenia is not always corrected in type Ib. Kidney transplantation can be performed in case of severe renal insufficiency. Combined liver-kidney grafts have been performed in a few cases. Prognosis is usually good: late hepatic and renal complications may occur, however, with adapted management, patients have almost normal life span. DISEASE NAME AND SYNONYMS: Glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency or G6P deficiency or glycogen storage disease type I or GSDI or type I glycogenosis or Von Gierke disease or Hepatorenal glycogenosis."
22899470,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence, incidence, and mortality rates of autoimmune rheumatic diseases (ARDs) by using a population-based database. METHODS: We used the longitudinal health insurance database (comprising 1,000,000 beneficiaries) of the Taiwan National Health Insurance from 2000 to 2008 and the National Death Registry of Taiwan from 2000 to 2008. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of major ARDs was 101.3 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 27.5-107.9) per 100,000 populations; the prevalence was 165.1 (95% CI 44.8-177.1) in women and 40.1 (95% CI 10.9-46.1) in men. The prevalences of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Sjögren's syndrome, progressive systemic sclerosis, polymyositis/dermatomyositis, vasculitis, and Behçet's disease were 52.4 (95% CI 14.2-57.2), 37.0 (95% CI 10.0-41.0), 16.0 (95% CI 4.3-18.7), 3.8 (95% CI 1.0-5.3), 2.9 (95% CI 0.8-4.2), 5.7 (95% CI 1.6-7.4), and 1.4 (95% CI 0.4-2.3) per 100,000 persons, respectively. Between 2001 and 2008, the incidence rates (per 100,000 person-years) for these diseases were 17.3, 8.4, 10.6, 1.5, 1.5, 1.2, and 0.8, respectively. The incident cases with ARDs had a higher risk of mortality, with the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) ranging from 1.3 to 3.7. CONCLUSION: In 2000, the prevalence of major ARDs was 1.4-52.4 per 100,000 persons in Taiwan. Between 2000 and 2008, the incidence rates of various ARDs were 0.8-17.3 per 100,000 person-years. The prevalence and incidence of RA were the highest, followed by SLE and Sjögren's syndrome, and those of Behçet's disease were the lowest. Patients with different types of ARDs had higher mortality and SMR than those of the general population."
19269120,"UNLABELLED: X-linked adenoleukodystrophy is a genetic disease that affects the degradation of very long-chain fatty acids. In male patients, common pictures are the cerebral form (CALD), myeloneuropathy (AMN), and Addison-only. OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical course of affected male patients from South Brazil between 1993 and 2007. METHODS: Affected male patients and their maternal lineages were studied from a clinical, neurological and biochemical standpoint. RESULTS: Eighty-three male patients from 30 families were biochemically evaluated: 51 were affected. 27/51 (54%) presented the cerebral form; 11/51 had AMN (22%); 5 had Addison-only (10%), and 8 (16%) were asymptomatic. Between 2002 and 2006, the minimal incidence was 1:35,000 males in our State (South Brazil). Forty-three affected individuals were followed for 5.4+/-3.7 years. Of 10 boys detected at early stages, three developed CALD. These three boys and another five CALD at baseline were referred to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Seven transplants were carried out, 5 with good clinical evolution after 2.2 years post-transplant. The non-transplanted case was later defined as a stable cerebral form. DISCUSSION: Among the present families, the observed cases were comparable to the 50% expected by Mendelian segregation. Based on the natural history, the number of cases that developed CALD was similar to the expected. Transplants were successful in 70% of cases. The occurrence of a stable cerebral form pointed to an urgent need for better markers of active cerebral disease."
23871090,"Achalasia is a rare motility disorder of the oesophagus characterised by loss of enteric neurons leading to absence of peristalsis and impaired relaxation of the lower oesophageal sphincter. Although its cause remains largely unknown, ganglionitis resulting from an aberrant immune response triggered by a viral infection has been proposed to underlie the loss of oesophageal neurons, particularly in genetically susceptible individuals. The subsequent stasis of ingested food not only leads to symptoms of dysphagia, regurgitation, chest pain, and weight loss, but also results in an increased risk of oesophageal carcinoma. At present, pneumatic dilatation and Heller myotomy combined with an anti-reflux procedure are the treatments of choice and have comparable success rates. Per-oral endoscopic myotomy has recently been introduced as a new minimally invasive treatment for achalasia, but there have not yet been any randomised clinical trials comparing this option with pneumatic dilatation and Heller myotomy."
22950490,"Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) describes a spectrum of clinically, pathologically and genetically heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorders of unknown aetiology. FTLD spectrum disorders collectively represent a leading cause of early-onset dementia, with most cases presenting between 45 and 64 years of age. FTLD is characterized by progressive changes in behaviour, executive dysfunction and/or language impairment and can be differentiated clinically into three frontotemporal dementia (FTD) syndromes as follows: (i) behavioural variant (bvFTD); (ii) semantic dementia (SD); and (iii) progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA). Additionally, there is a significant clinical, pathological and genetic overlap between FTD and motor neuron disease/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FTD-ALS) and the atypical parkinsonian syndromes, progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and corticobasal syndrome (CBS). bvFTD is characterized by progressive behavioural impairment and a decline in executive function with frontal lobe-predominant atrophy, SD by a loss of object knowledge with prominent anomia and asymmetrical atrophy of the anterior temporal lobes and PNFA by expressive or motor speech deficits with predominantly left peri-sylvian atrophy. Recent advances in molecular biology and immunohistochemical staining techniques have further classified the FTLD spectrum disorders based upon the predominant neuropathological protein into three main categories: (i) microtubule-associated protein tau (FTLD-TAU); (ii) TAR DNA-binding protein-43 (FTLD-TDP); and (iii) fused in sarcoma protein (FTLD-FUS). Up to 40% of FTD patients report a family history of neurodegenerative illness, and one-third to one-half of familial cases of FTD follow an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. Mutations in MAPT, PGRN, TARDBP, VCP and CHMP2B have been described, along with a recently identified C9ORF72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion. To date, there are no US FDA-approved treatments or disease-modifying therapies for FTD. Pharmacological strategies have focused on neurotransmitter replacement and modulation for the treatment of behavioural, motor and cognitive symptoms of FTD, and include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), atypical antipsychotics, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and glutamate NMDA receptor antagonists. At present, adequate management of FTD symptoms involves a combination of pharmacological therapy with behavioural, physical and environmental modification techniques."
10842277,"A 10-year retrospective review was conducted to ascertain the prevalence of inclusion body myositis (IBM) in Western Australia. Seventeen patients with sporadic IBM aged 45-90 years were identified and the prevalence of IBM was calculated to be 9.3 x 10(-6). The prevalence was higher in men (10.9 x 10(-6)) than in women (7.7 x 10(-6)). The mean age of onset of IBM was 56.6 years, and the mean delay between onset of symptoms and diagnosis was 4.4 years. The age-adjusted prevalence over the age of 50 years was 35.3 x 10(-6). The results suggest a higher prevalence of IBM than has previously been reported."
15298225,"OBJECTIVE: To use new data to make a revised estimate of the global burden of typhoid fever, an accurate understanding of which is necessary to guide public health decisions for disease control and prevention efforts. METHODS: Population-based studies using confirmation by blood culture of typhoid fever cases were sought by computer search of the multilingual scientific literature. Where there were no eligible studies, data were extrapolated from neighbouring countries and regions. Age-incidence curves were used to model rates measured among narrow age cohorts to the general population. One-way sensitivity analysis was performed to explore the sensitivity of the estimate to the assumptions. The burden of paratyphoid fever was derived by a proportional method. FINDINGS: A total of 22 eligible studies were identified. Regions with high incidence of typhoid fever (>100/100,000 cases/year) include south-central Asia and south-eastAsia. Regions of medium incidence (10-100/100,000 cases/year) include the rest of Asia, Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, and Oceania, except for Australia and New Zealand. Europe, North America, and the rest of the developed world have low incidence of typhoid fever (<10/100,000 cases/year). We estimate that typhoid fever caused 21,650,974 illnesses and 216,510 deaths during 2000 and that paratyphoid fever caused 5,412,744 illnesses. CONCLUSION: New data and improved understanding of typhoid fever epidemiology enabled us to refine the global typhoid burden estimate, which remains considerable. More detailed incidence studies in selected countries and regions, particularly Africa, are needed to further improve the estimate."
10980538,"Lysinuric protein intolerance is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by defective transport of the dibasic aminoacids. Mutational analysis of LPI patients in the northern part of Japan revealed that six were homozygous for the R410X mutation and two others were compound heterozygotes of R410X and other unknown mutations. In the population epidemiology study in a local cluster in the northern part of Iwate, ten heterozygotes were found in 1190 newborn babies leading to an estimated LPI incidence of 1/57,000. Polymorphism analysis revealed two major alleles, A and B, in intron 8. While the population frequency of allele A was 0.9 and that of allele B was 0.1 in the northern part of Japan the R410X mutations were exclusively on allele B in 31 chromosomes suggesting a founder effect. Genetic analysis in patients revealed strong linkage disequilibrium with D14S283 and TCRA indicating that the R410X mutation occurred before at least 130 generations ago (about 2600 years). The R410X mutation was shown to be useful as a molecular marker for screening LPI patients in the northern part of Japan."
29215653,"PURPOSE:The incidence of neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is ~1/2,000 live births, but the current estimates of prevalence vary greatly. This retrospective total-population study was aimed at determining the prevalence of NF1 in Finland. METHODS:All secondary and tertiary referral centers of Finland were searched for NF1 patients. Patient records were manually reviewed and patients fulfilling the National Institutes of Health diagnostic criteria for NF1 were included. Prevalence on 31 December 2005 was determined. Data on incidence and survival were combined to refine the prevalence estimation. RESULTS:A total of 1,279 patients with NF1 were alive on 31 December 2005, yielding a prevalence of 1/4,088 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1/4,320-1/3,869). The survival of patients with NF1 was inferior compared with the general population (hazard ratio 3.10, 95% CI 2.73-3.53, P < 0.001). When the survival rates of NF1 patients and the Finnish population were combined with an estimate of NF1 incidence, a prevalence of 1/2,052 (95% CI 1/2,176-1/1,941) was estimated for NF1 in a population aged 0-74 years. CONCLUSION:NF1 is a much more common disorder than previously thought. A large proportion of NF1 patients may not be correctly identified by health-care systems or they do not seek secondary health care for their NF1."
20648890,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of cleft lip and palate in births taking place in hospitals in the Yazd province, Iran. METHOD: The records of 65,236 live births delivered at 12 hospitals in Yazd province, including Yazd city and four cities of the states, over a four year period from 2003 to 2006 were examined. RESULTS: Fifty six cases of cleft lip and palate were found, a prevalence of 0.86 per 1,000. Among the fifty six cases, there were seventeen cases (30.4%) of isolated cleft palate; thirteen cases (23.2%) of cleft lip and twenty six cases (46.4%) of cleft lip and palate. No statistically significant difference in the occurrence of cleft lip and palate were observed by the season of the birth, gender of newborn or maternal age. In regard to type of cleft, the prevalence of isolated cleft palate was higher in females than in males (p = 0.04). The prevalence of cleft lip was higher in summer than other seasons (p = 0.01). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of cleft lip and palate among live births in Yazd is 0.86 per 1,000 births, that is 1 per 1,163 births."
17428725,"Anisakis simplex complex presently comprises three sibling species, A. simplex sensu stricto, A. pegreffii and A. simplex C. A. simplex is a common parasite in fishes and cephalopods and capable of causing anisakiasis in humans. Therefore, identification of sibling species of A. simplex was important for human health. In this study, one hundred Anisakis type I larvae isolated from eighty five patients with anisakiasis in Hokkaido and Kyushu in Japan were analyzed by adapting the new molecular method that can identify the sibling species of A. simplex complex. Based on the restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) pattern of ITS regions including 5.8 subunit rRNA gene, we identified two sibling species, A. simplex s. str. and A. pegreffii. However, the infection rate of A. simplex s. str. was significantly higher than that of A. pegreffii. Eighty four (98.8%) out of the eighty five patients were infected with A. simplex s. str. On the contrary, one patients (1.2%) in Kyushu infected with A. pegreffii. This study provided basic information about human infection with A. simplex complex. Furthermore, we suggested that A. simplex s. str. is the most important etiological agent in Japan."
23523389,"Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia occurs in both children and adults but its incidence peaks between 2 and 5 years of age. Causation is multifactorial and exogenous or endogenous exposures, genetic susceptibility, and chance have roles. Survival in paediatric acute lymphoblastic leukaemia has improved to roughly 90% in trials with risk stratification by biological features of leukaemic cells and response to treatment, treatment modification based on patients' pharmacodynamics and pharmacogenomics, and improved supportive care. However, innovative approaches are needed to further improve survival while reducing adverse effects. Prognosis remains poor in infants and adults. Genome-wide profiling of germline and leukaemic cell DNA has identified novel submicroscopic structural genetic changes and sequence mutations that contribute to leukaemogenesis, define new disease subtypes, affect responsiveness to treatment, and might provide novel prognostic markers and therapeutic targets for personalised medicine."
7563255,"The present study describes the epidemiological profile and clinical features of Takayasu's arteritis (TA) in Kuwait, as well as its association with other autoimmune diseases and primary hypercoagulable states. Thirteen patients were included from its start on 1 January 1989 till 30 June 1994. Diagnosis of TA was established by angiographic studies. Twelve patients were Arabs and 7 were Kuwaiti nationals. Five patients were males and renal disease secondary to isolated involvement of the abdominal aorta (TA, type II) was the main presentation in 4 patients. Coagulation tests were performed in 7 patients and included antiphospholipid antibody (aPL) assay as well as protein S, protein C and antithrombin III activity. Only one manifested recurrent thrombosis and laboratory tests confirmed the presence of a hypercoagulable state secondary to aPL and protein S deficiency. Serological tests of systemic lupus erythematosis (SLE) were positive in this patient. These data indicate that TA is not a rare disease in the Arabic population. In our study, female predominance was not a common feature of TA and renal disease secondary to TA type II disease was commonly encountered. The association of TA with SLE and primary hypercoagulable states was not a consistent finding in our patients with TA, and hence, the proposed role for thrombotic vasculopathy in the pathogenesis and progression of this disease was unfounded."
15258214,"To determine the prevalence and causation of late onset cerebellar ataxia (LOCA) in south east Wales, United Kingdom.A population based study of LOCA was conducted in a defined geographical region with a total population of 742,400. Multiple sources of ascertainment were used to identify all cases prevalent on 1 January 2001. The inclusion criteria were: a predominantly progressive cerebellar ataxia with onset of symptoms at age > or = 18 years; and disease duration of > or = 1 year. Cases with known acquired ataxias, ataxic syndromes with associated prominent autonomic dysfunction and/or atypical parkinsonism suggestive of multiple system atrophy and disorders with ataxia as a minor feature were excluded.We identified 76 index cases of LOCA, of whom 63 were sporadic, idiopathic LOCA (ILOCA) and 13 were familial LOCA, of whom six had either spinocerebellar ataxia type 6, Friedreich's ataxia or dominant episodic ataxia. The mean annual incidence rate for the period 1999-2001 was 0.3/100,000 population/year. The crude prevalence rates were 8.4 per 100,000 (95% CI 7.2 to 11.6) for ILOCA and 1.8 per 100,000 (95% CI 0.8 to 2.7) for inherited LOCA. Of the 54/63 (85.7%) patients with ILOCA who were assessed, mean (SD) age at onset of symptoms was 53.8 (14.1) years (range 19 to 78) with a male:female ratio of 2.1:1. The mean disease duration was 8.7 (6.3) years (range 1 to 31). The most frequent presenting complaint was disturbance in gait (90.7%). One-third had a relatively pure cerebellar syndrome (33.3%) and two-thirds (66.7%) had additional extracerebellar neurological features. The majority (92%) were ambulant but only 9.3% were independently self-caring.This population based study provides insight into LOCA within a defined region and will inform decisions about the rational use of healthcare resources for patients with LOCA."
1609834,"The incidence of neuronal ceroid-lipofuscinoses (NCL) in West Germany was determined using a novel method which is applicable to other autosomal recessively inherited diseases. Questionnaires were sent to all pediatric departments (answer rate 189/276, 68%), schools for the blind (39/46, 85%), and neuropathological institutes (15/22, 68%). Diagnoses were accepted only when based on firm clinical and/or electron microscopic criteria; 207 such identified patients were sorted according to year of birth. Plotting the cumulative number of new cases per year against the year of birth resulted in a slightly S-shaped curve. Before the year 1962, the curve is relatively flat, probably due to inefficient case registration. Between 1968 and 1977, the slope of the curve is constant--a steep, nearly straight line. Thereafter the curve flattens out again, likely due to inefficient registration of young, still undiagnosed patients. We interpret the central segment of the curve, which is continuously straight over a period of 10 years and corresponds to 92 patients, as a period in which efficient registration of new cases occurred. The number of live births being 7,211,543 during the same period, the NCL incidence is calculated to be 1.28 per 100,000 live births (0.71 for juvenile NCL and 0.46 for late infantile NCL)."
9088407,"We studied the case records of 1122 patients with endogenous uveitis including 418 new cases treated at the University Eye Clinic in Turku during the years 1980-1982 and 1988. The mean annual incidence and prevalence rates (per 100,000 population) of idiopathic acute anterior uveitis were 17.1 and 48.5, respectively, sarcoid anterior uveitis 0.5 and 1.5, Posner-Schlossman syndrome 0.4 and 1.9, herpes zoster uveitis 0.4 and 0.7, idiopathic chronic anterior uveitis 0.3 and 7.3, herpes simplex keratouveitis 0.3 and 0.5, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis 0.2 and 2.4, Fuchs' heterochromic iridocyclitis 0.2 and 0.5, intermediate uveitis 0.3 and 1.4, and of toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis 0.3 and 2.4. The incidence and prevalence rates of acute anterior uveitis associated with ankylosing spondylitis were 2.0 and 10.3 per 100,000 population, respectively, and this disease association occurred more often in men than in women (p < 0.001). The mean annual incidence of idiopathic acute anterior uveitis was significantly lower in the age group 0-19 years than in the other age groups (p < 0.001)."
21653939,"The incidence of early death in a large population of unselected patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) remains unknown because of the paucity of outcome data available for patients treated outside of clinical trials. We undertook an epidemiologic study to estimate the true rate of early death with data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program. A total of 1400 patients with a diagnosis of APL between 1992 and 2007 were identified. The overall early death rate was 17.3%, and only a modest change in early death rate was observed over time. The early death rate was significantly higher in patients aged ≥ 55 years (24.2%; P < .0001). The 3-year survival improved from 54.6% to 70.1% over the study period but was significantly lower in patients aged ≥ 55 years (46.4%; P < .0001). This study shows that the early death rate remains high despite the wide availability of all-trans retinoic acid and appears significantly higher than commonly reported in multicenter clinical trials. These data highlight a need to educate health care providers across a wide range of medical fields, who may be the first to evaluate patients with APL, to have a major effect on early death and the cure rate of APL."
19291512,"UNLABELLED: OBJECTIVES. To define the incidence and prevalence of familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP) TTRVal30Met on the island of Cyprus. To study the clinical phenotype and genetic features of FAP TTRVal30Met in the Cypriot population. METHODS: The clinical and neurogenetic databases were used to identify probands with FAP TTRVal30Met and detailed family trees were constructed. Potential carriers of the mutation were identified from the family trees and assessed clinically and genetically. Transthyretin was completely sequenced in patients and potential carriers. RESULTS: Thirty-six patients carrying the TTRVal30Met mutation (one homozygote) from 22 families were identified. On 1 December 2003 the prevalence of FAP was 3.72/100,000 while the incidence is estimated to be 0.69/100,000 per year. The phenotype observed was characteristic for a length dependent sensorimotor and autonomic neuropathy with neuropathic pain. Mean age of onset was 46 years. Penetrance is estimated to be 28% and positive anticipation in the age of onset is found. CONCLUSION: FAP is relatively prevalent in Cyprus which may be considered as another endemic focus of the disease in Europe. The mean age of onset and penetrance is different from the Portuguese and Swedish populations. Understanding the biological factors that determine these differences could potentially lead to therapeutic advances."
20399414,"The French National Reference Center of Primary Immunodeficiencies (CEREDIH) was established in 2005 and now constitutes a nationwide network of pediatric and adult medicine departments in university medical centers. The registry comprises a total of 3,083 patients (mainly children), with an overall prevalence of 4.4 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. Predominantly B-cell immunodeficiencies are the most common diseases observed (43%). The proportion of common variable immunodeficiencies (CVIDs, 14%) is lower than reported by national registries in other developed countries. The data suggest that although referral to expert centers is fairly adequate for children, this is not yet the case in France for adults. The distribution of primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) varied significantly across distinct geographical areas and this suggested regional differences in patient care. As the world's largest national registry of PIDs, CEREDIH provides a basis for both further studies and activities aimed at raising the physicians' awareness of PIDs (notably in adults)."
16601872,"North Carolina (NC) was the first US state to initiate universal tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) newborn screening. This began as a statewide pilot project in 1997 to determine the incidence and feasibility of screening for fatty acid oxidation, organic acid and selected amino acid disorders. The MS/MS analyses were done by a commercial laboratory and all follow-up and confirmatory testing was performed through the NC Newborn Screening (NBS) Program. In April 1999, the NC NBS Laboratory began the MS/MS analyses in-house. Between 28 July 1997 and 28 July 2005, 944,078 infants were screened and 219 diagnoses were confirmed on newborns with elevated screening results, for an overall incidence of 1:4,300. Ninety-nine infants were identified with fatty acid oxidation disorders, 58 with organic acidaemias and 62 with aminoacidopathies. Medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase deficiency and disorders of phenylalanine metabolism were the most common disorders detected. Identification of affected infants has allowed retrospective testing of other family members, resulting in an additional 16 diagnoses. Seven neonates died from complications of their metabolic disorders/prematurity despite timely MS/MS screening. In addition, there were six infants who were not identified by elevated NBS results but who presented with symptoms later in infancy. The NC MS/MS NBS Program uses a two-tier system, categorizing results as either 'borderline' or 'diagnostic' elevated, for both the cutoffs and follow-up protocol. Infants with an initial borderline result had only a repeat screen. Infants with a diagnostic or two borderline results were referred for confirmatory testing. The positive predictive value of the NC MS/MS NBS for those infants requiring confirmatory testing was 53% for 2003 and 2004. The success of the NC MS/MS NBS Program in identifying infants with metabolic disorders was dependent on a comprehensive follow-up protocol integrating the public health laboratory and the academic metabolic centres."
29323665,"PURPOSE:We delineate the clinical spectrum and describe the histology in arterial tortuosity syndrome (ATS), a rare connective tissue disorder characterized by tortuosity of the large and medium-sized arteries, caused by mutations in SLC2A10. METHODS:We retrospectively characterized 40 novel ATS families (50 patients) and reviewed the 52 previously reported patients. We performed histology and electron microscopy (EM) on skin and vascular biopsies and evaluated TGF-β signaling with immunohistochemistry for pSMAD2 and CTGF. RESULTS:Stenoses, tortuosity, and aneurysm formation are widespread occurrences. Severe but rare vascular complications include early and aggressive aortic root aneurysms, neonatal intracranial bleeding, ischemic stroke, and gastric perforation. Thus far, no reports unequivocally document vascular dissections or ruptures. Of note, diaphragmatic hernia and infant respiratory distress syndrome (IRDS) are frequently observed. Skin and vascular biopsies show fragmented elastic fibers (EF) and increased collagen deposition. EM of skin EF shows a fragmented elastin core and a peripheral mantle of microfibrils of random directionality. Skin and end-stage diseased vascular tissue do not indicate increased TGF-β signaling. CONCLUSION:Our findings warrant attention for IRDS and diaphragmatic hernia, close monitoring of the aortic root early in life, and extensive vascular imaging afterwards. EM on skin biopsies shows disease-specific abnormalities."
16150940,"Because the causes of most lymphoid neoplasms remain unknown, comparison of incidence patterns by disease subtype may provide critical clues for future etiologic investigations. We therefore conducted a comprehensive assessment of 114,548 lymphoid neoplasms diagnosed during 1992-2001 in 12 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registries according to the internationally recognized World Health Organization (WHO) lymphoma classification introduced in 2001. Cases coded in International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, Second Edition (ICD-O-2), were converted to ICD-O-3 for WHO subtype assignment. Age-specific and age-adjusted rates were compared by sex and race (white, black, Asian). Age-adjusted trends in incidence were estimated by sex and race using weighted least squares log-linear regression. Diverse incidence patterns and trends were observed by lymphoid neoplasm subtype and population. In the elderly (75 years or older), rates of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and follicular lymphoma increased 1.4% and 1.8% per year, respectively, whereas rates of chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) declined 2.1% per year. Although whites bear the highest incidence burden for most lymphoid neoplasm subtypes, most notably for hairy cell leukemia and follicular lymphoma, black predominance was observed for plasma cell and T-cell neoplasms. Asians have considerably lower rates than whites and blacks for CLL/SLL and Hodgkin lymphoma. We conclude that the striking differences in incidence patterns by histologic subtype strongly suggest that there is etiologic heterogeneity among lymphoid neoplasms and support the pursuit of epidemiologic analysis by subtype."
20509956,"BACKGROUND: Sex chromosomal abnormalities are relatively common, yet many aspects of these syndromes remain unexplored. For instance epidemiological data in 47,XYY persons are still limited. METHODS: Using a national Danish registry, we identified 208 persons with 47,XYY or a compatible karyotype, whereof 36 were deceased; all were diagnosed from 1968 to 2008. For further analyses, we identified age matched controls from the male background population (n = 20,078) in Statistics Denmark. We report nationwide prevalence data, data regarding age at diagnosis, as well as total and cause specific mortality data in these persons. RESULTS: The average prevalence was 14.2 47,XYY persons per 100,000, which is reduced compared to the expected 98 per 100,000. Their median age at diagnosis was 17.1 years. We found a significantly decreased lifespan from 77.9 years (controls) to 67.5 years (47,XYY persons). Total mortality was significantly increased compared to controls, with a hazard ratio of 3.6 (2.6-5.1). Dividing the causes of deaths according to the International Classification of Diseases, we identified an increased hazard ratio in all informative chapters, with a significantly increased ratio in cancer, pulmonary, neurological and unspecified diseases, and trauma. CONCLUSION: We here present national epidemiological data regarding 47,XYY syndrome, including prevalence and mortality data, showing a significantly delay to diagnosis, reduced life expectancy and an increased total and cause specific mortality."
23090517,"OBJECTIVE:To estimate the birth prevalence and 7-year case-fatality rate of peripartum cardiomyopathy for a statewide population by applying the National Institutes of Health Workshop on Peripartum Cardiomyopathy definition, including echocardiographic criteria for left ventricular dysfunction. METHODS:This was an epidemiologic study of residents of North Carolina experiencing an obstetric delivery or a pregnancy-related death before delivery in 2002 through 2003 including 235,599 live births. Potential cases were identified from International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), pregnancy and cardiovascular codes followed by medical record review, and from the state pregnancy-related mortality file. Only women meeting the established definition including echocardiographic criteria for left ventricular dysfunction and women with diagnoses at autopsy were included. The state death file and the U.S. Social Security Death Index were searched for the years 2002 through 2010 for all cases. RESULTS:A total of 740 potential cases from 70 hospitals were identified from discharge ICD-9-CM codes. The medical records for 698 (94.3%) were located and reviewed. Seventy-eight met inclusion criteria. An additional seven women had diagnoses only at autopsy. The birth prevalence was 1 case for every 2,772 live births or 3.61 cases per 10,000 live births (95% confidence interval 2.88-4.46). The 7-year case-fatality rate was 16.5% (95% confidence interval 10--25.9%). Black non-Hispanic women experienced an almost fourfold increased prevalence and fatality compared with white women. Women older than age 35 years had the highest prevalence. CONCLUSIONS:The racial disparity in both birth prevalence and case-fatality is striking; one in six women died within 7 years. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE:II."
11923553,"BACKGROUND:The prevalence of sporadic and familial idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) cases in Finland was evaluated according to the revised recommendations of the American Thoracic Society. METHODS:All Finnish pulmonary clinics (n=29) were included in the primary screening. Hospital data bases were used to identify patients with the diagnosis ""alveolitis fibroticans idiopathica"" (J84.1 in ICD-10 classification). The total number of patients with IPF was extrapolated based on the evaluation of random samples of case records in different centres. Families with more than one potentially affected member were identified from a questionnaire study and the diagnosis was verified from the medical records. RESULTS:Using this approach, the nationwide prevalence of IPF in Finland was estimated to be 16-18/100 000. In 90% of the patients lung involvement was assessed by high resolution computed tomographic (HRCT) scanning and in 31% a surgical biopsy specimen was available, further confirming the diagnosis. Seventeen multiplex families with 2-5 affected family members were identified, giving a prevalence of 5.9/million for familial IPF in Finland. Both multiplex and sporadic families were clustered in Eastern Finland. This clustering reflects the demographic history of Finland in the 16th century and suggests that multiplex families may share a common ancestor in the last 20-25 generations. CONCLUSION:The familial form explained 3.3-3.7% of all Finnish cases of IPF diagnosed according to the revised international guidelines. Geographical clustering of multiplex families suggests a recent founder effect in patients with familial IPF."
23516313,"OBJECTIVES:To obtain minimum point prevalence rates for the skeletal muscle channelopathies and to evaluate the frequency distribution of mutations associated with these disorders. METHODS:Analysis of demographic, clinical, electrophysiologic, and genetic data of all patients assessed at our national specialist channelopathy service. Only patients living in the United Kingdom with a genetically defined diagnosis of nondystrophic myotonia or periodic paralysis were eligible for the study. Prevalence rates were estimated for England, December 2011. RESULTS:A total of 665 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria, of which 593 were living in England, giving a minimum point prevalence of 1.12/100,000 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03-1.21). Disease-specific prevalence figures were as follows: myotonia congenita 0.52/100,000 (95% CI 0.46-0.59), paramyotonia congenita 0.17/100,000 (95% CI 0.13-0.20), sodium channel myotonias 0.06/100,000 (95% CI 0.04-0.08), hyperkalemic periodic paralysis 0.17/100,000 (95% CI 0.13-0.20), hypokalemic periodic paralysis 0.13/100,000 (95% CI 0.10-0.17), and Andersen-Tawil syndrome (ATS) 0.08/100,000 (95% CI 0.05-0.10). In the whole sample (665 patients), 15 out of 104 different CLCN1 mutations accounted for 60% of all patients with myotonia congenita, 11 out of 22 SCN4A mutations for 86% of paramyotonia congenita/sodium channel myotonia pedigrees, and 3 out of 17 KCNJ2 mutations for 42% of ATS pedigrees. CONCLUSION:We describe for the first time the overall prevalence of genetically defined skeletal muscle channelopathies in England. Despite the large variety of mutations observed in patients with nondystrophic myotonia and ATS, a limited number accounted for a large proportion of cases."
9746765,"Immunization against the human platelet antigen (HPA)-1 alloantigen is the most common cause of severe fetal and neonatal thrombocytopenia. Fetal therapy has substantial risks and its indications need better definition. Of 24,417 consecutive pregnant women, 618 (2.5%) were HPA-1a negative of whom 385 entered an observational study. All were HLA-DRB3*0101 genotyped and screened for anti-HPA-1a. Their partners and neonates were HPA-1 genotyped and the latter were assessed by cord blood platelet counts and cerebral ultrasound scans. Anti-HPA-1a was detected in 46 of 387 pregnancies (12.0%; 95% CI 8.7%-15.2%). All but one were HLA-DRB3*0101 positive (odds ratio 140; 95% CI 19-1035; P< .00001). One baby died in utero, and of 26 HPA-1a-positive babies born to women with persistent antenatal antibodies, 9 were severely thrombocytopenic (8 with a count <10 x 10(9)/L, 1 with a large porencephalic cyst), 10 were mildly thrombocytopenic, whereas 7 had normal platelet counts. Severe thrombocytopenia was significantly associated with a third trimester anti-HPA-1a titer >/= 1:32 (P = . 004), but was not observed in babies of women with either transient or postnatal-only antibodies. HPA-1a alloimmunization complicates 1 in 350 unselected pregnancies, resulting in severe thrombocytopenia in 1:1,200. HPA-1a and HLA-DRB3*0101 typing combined with anti-HPA-1a titration allows selection of the majority of pregnancies at risk of severe thrombocytopenia."
14989684,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the birth prevalence of cleft lip and palate (CL +/- P) in the municipality of Sucre, Bolivia. To ascertain whether the birth prevalence in this region differs significantly from birth prevalence reported in similar populations and other racial groups. RESULTS: Twenty-eight clefts were identified among 22,746 live births between the years 1995 and 2001 in three maternity hospitals in the city. The total birth prevalence of CL +/- P was 1.23/1000 live births per year. There were 12 clefts of the lip alone (birth prevalence 0.53/1000 per year), 15 cleft lip and palate (0.66/1000 per year), and one cleft palate only (0.04/1000 per year). CONCLUSIONS: The birth prevalence was not significantly different from birth prevalence published previously in South American populations, although it is lower than previously published data from Bolivia. The birth prevalence of CL +/- P in this South American population was similar to published data in white subjects and between those found in black and oriental groups. The sex ratio and birth prevalence of simultaneous congenital malformations also did not differ from previously published figures."
19035493,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of Behçet's disease (BD) in a multiethnic population living in France, with particular focus on disease risk among immigrants. METHODS: The study was conducted in a county in the Paris metropolitan area that is home to 1,094,412 adults (ages > or =15 years), of whom 26% are of non-European ancestry. Patients with BD living in this area during 2003 were identified using 3 sources (hospitals, community physicians, and the National Health Insurance database), and diagnoses were verified using the International Study Group criteria. Standardized, year-2003 prevalence rates were computed for the overall population and for each ethnic group. Stratified prevalence rates according to age at immigration to France were calculated to investigate the relationship between age at immigration and BD risk. RESULTS: Seventy-nine subjects fulfilled our search criteria. The overall prevalence per 100,000 adults was 7.1 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 3.5-14.4), and the prevalence for populations of European, North African, and Asian ancestry was 2.4 (95% CI 0.6-7.2), 34.6 (95% CI 24.4-47.5), and 17.5 (95% CI 10.7-27.2), respectively. Within the migrant population of either North African or Asian ancestry, BD prevalences were similar for residents born in France, residents <15 years old at immigration, and residents > or =15 years old at immigration. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that the prevalence of BD among immigrants of North African or Asian ancestry is significantly higher than that in the European-origin population, and comparable with rates reported from North Africa and Asia. Moreover, our results suggest that BD risk is not related to age at immigration. These findings support the hypothesis that BD has a primarily hereditary basis."
27325254,"Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a leading cause of end-stage renal disease, but estimates of its prevalence vary by >10-fold. The objective of this study was to examine the public health impact of ADPKD in the European Union (EU) by estimating minimum prevalence (point prevalence of known cases) and screening prevalence (minimum prevalence plus cases expected after population-based screening).A review of the epidemiology literature from January 1980 to February 2015 identified population-based studies that met criteria for methodological quality. These examined large German and British populations, providing direct estimates of minimum prevalence and screening prevalence. In a second approach, patients from the 2012 European Renal Association‒European Dialysis and Transplant Association (ERA-EDTA) Registry and literature-based inflation factors that adjust for disease severity and screening yield were used to estimate prevalence across 19 EU countries (N = 407 million).Population-based studies yielded minimum prevalences of 2.41 and 3.89/10 000, respectively, and corresponding estimates of screening prevalences of 3.3 and 4.6/10 000. A close correspondence existed between estimates in countries where both direct and registry-derived methods were compared, which supports the validity of the registry-based approach. Using the registry-derived method, the minimum prevalence was 3.29/10 000 (95% confidence interval 3.27-3.30), and if ADPKD screening was implemented in all countries, the expected prevalence was 3.96/10 000 (3.94-3.98).ERA-EDTA-based prevalence estimates and application of a uniform definition of prevalence to population-based studies consistently indicate that the ADPKD point prevalence is <5/10 000, the threshold for rare disease in the EU."
21668957,"Autosomal Recessive Primary Microcephaly (MCPH) is a rare disorder of neurogenic mitosis characterized by reduced head circumference at birth with variable degree of mental retardation. In MCPH patients, brain size reduced to almost one-third of its original volume due to reduced number of generated cerebral cortical neurons during embryonic neurogensis. So far, seven genetic loci (MCPH1-7) for this condition have been mapped with seven corresponding genes (MCPH1, WDR62, CDK5RAP2, CEP152, ASPM, CENPJ, and STIL) identified from different world populations. Contribution of ASPM and WDR62 gene mutations in MCPH World wide is more than 50%. By and large, primary microcephaly patients are phenotypically indistinguishable, however, recent studies in patients with mutations in MCPH1, WDR62 and ASPM genes showed a broader clinical and/or cellular phenotype. It has been proposed that mutations in MCPH genes can cause the disease phenotype by disturbing: 1) orientation of mitotic spindles, 2) chromosome condensation mechanism during embryonic neurogenesis, 3) DNA damage-response signaling, 4) transcriptional regulations and microtubule dynamics, 5) certain unknown centrosomal mechanisms that control the number of neurons generated by neural precursor cells. Recent discoveries of mammalian models for MCPH have open up horizons for researchers to add more knowledge regarding the etiology and pathophysiology of MCPH. High incidence of MCPH in Pakistani population reflects the most probable involvement of consanguinity. Genetic counseling and clinical management through carrier detection/prenatal diagnosis in MCPH families can help reducing the incidence of this autosomal recessive disorder."
20938748,"the National Austrian Newborn Screening Program for inherited metabolic and endocrinologic disorders was introduced in 1966. The program continuously evolved by expanding the screening panel from phenylketonuria and galactosemia to congenital hypothyroidism, biotinidase deficiency, cystic fibrosis, and congenital adrenal hyperplasia. In 2002, the introduction of tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) substantially increased the number of detectable inborn errors of metabolism and now includes disorders of fatty acid oxidation, organic acidurias and various disorders of amino acid metabolism.in this study we report our eight years experience with MS/MS in Austria and give an overview of the incidence of diseases, organization, updates on methods and current development and future aspects.a total of 622,489 newborns were screened by MS/MS for more than 20 diseases in Austria between April 2002 and December 2009. Dried blood spot samples were collected and sent to the National Laboratory for Newborn Screening located at the Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.The resulting overall prevalence of inherited metabolic disorder identified by MS/MS was 1:2855, including 125 newborns with amino acidemias (1:4,980), 46 with organic acidurias (1:13,532), and 47 with fatty acid oxidation disorders (1:13,244).the introduction of MS/MS technology in Austria significantly increased the detection of inherited metabolic disorders that were previously not covered. A primary goal is the continuous effort by developing second-tier strategies with the inclusion of more specific markers in order to minimize the risk of false-negatives and to improve the positive predictive value of screening results. Early recognition of these disorders enables diagnosis and treatment before the onset of symptoms."
15863154,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this epidemiological study was to report histology-specific age-adjusted ovarian cancer incidence rates that were standardized to the recently adopted year 2000 United States standard population. METHODS: We utilized data gathered from eleven population-based cancer registries of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program of the National Cancer Institute for the years 1992 through 1999. Our analyses included data on 23,484 microscopically confirmed cases of primary malignant ovarian cancer that were diagnosed in women residing in the eleven SEER registries. RESULTS: We categorized the 117 different histologies that were diagnosed in the 23,484 ovarian cancer cases into ten major classifications. The overall age-adjusted incidence rate for all ovarian cancer cases was 16.23 cases per 100,000 women. Epithelial tumors displayed the highest age-adjusted incidence rate (15.48), followed by germ cell tumors (0.41), sex cord-stromal tumors (0.20), and all other miscellaneous ovarian tumors (0.13). Serous epithelial tumors were the most commonly observed epithelial group (6.77 cases per 100,000 women), followed by other miscellaneous epithelial tumors (3.76), mucinous epithelial tumors (2.22), endometrioid epithelial tumors (2.11), and clear cell epithelial tumors (0.64). Notable differences were observed in the age-adjusted incidence rates for White and Black women. CONCLUSIONS: Age-adjusted incidence rates of ovarian cancer vary by histology. This is the first study to standardize histology-specific age-adjusted incidence rates of ovarian cancer to the new 2000 United States standard population."
25002140,"GNE myopathy is an autosomal recessive muscle disease caused by biallelic mutations in GNE, a gene encoding for a single protein with key enzymatic activities, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase and N-acetylmannosamine kinase, in sialic acid biosynthetic pathway. The diagnosis should be considered primarily in patients presenting with distal weakness (foot drop) in early adulthood (other onset symptoms are possible too). The disease slowly progresses to involve other lower and upper extremities' muscles, with marked sparing of the quadriceps. Characteristic findings on biopsies of affected muscles include 'rimmed' (autophagic) vacuoles, aggregation of various proteins and fibre size variation. The diagnosis is confirmed by sequencing of the GNE gene. Note that we use a new mutation nomenclature based on the longest transcript (GenBank: NM_001128227), which encodes a 31-amino acid longer protein than the originally described one (GenBank: NM_005476), which has been used previously in most papers. Based upon the pathophysiology of the disease, recent clinical trials as well as early gene therapy trials have evaluated the use of sialic acid or N-acetylmannosamine (a precursor of sialic acid) in patients with GNE myopathy. Now that therapies are under investigation, it is critical that a timely and accurate diagnosis is made in patients with GNE myopathy."
10951337,"BACKGROUND:Little is known, at a population level, about the incidence and management of gallbladder carcinoma. The objective of this study was to determine trends in incidence, treatment, stage at diagnosis, and prognosis of gallbladder carcinoma in a well defined population. METHODS:A series of 484 patients diagnosed over a 20-year period (1976-1995) in a French well defined population was used. Incidence rates were calculated by gender, age groups, and 5-year periods. Prognosis was determined using crude and relative survival rates. A multivariate relative survival analysis was performed. RESULTS:Age-standardized incidence rates were 0.8 per 100,000 inhabitants for men and 1.5 per 100,000 inhabitants for women. There were no significant time trends in incidence in both genders. The proportion of cases resected for cure increased from 18. 1% (1976-1980) to 42.4% (1991-1995) (P < 0.001) as well as the proportion of cases limited to the gallbladder wall, respectively from 15.7% to 27.8% (P < 0.001). Relative survival rates were 16.6% at 1 year and 6.2% at 5 years. Age, stage at diagnosis, and period of diagnosis significantly influenced the prognosis of gallbladder carcinoma. The 5-year relative survival rate rose from 2.7% (1976-1985) to 10.2% (1986-1995). The multivariate analysis showed that age and stage at diagnosis were independent prognostic factors. CONCLUSIONS:This study demonstrated that gallbladder carcinoma incidence is stable in France and that substantial advances in its management have been achieved, but there is evidence that further improvements are necessary to increase survival."
19718537,"Neonatal screening is helpful to prevent serious disability and sufferings caused by congenital or inherited disease. This study was to review the status of neonatal screening for congenital hypothyroidism (CH) and phenylketonuria (PKU) in China.We analyzed data of neonatal screening for CH and PKU in the past two decades which were obtained from the national network of neonatal screening centers collected by the National Center for Clinical Laboratory.Of 18.8 million newborns screened from 1985 to 2007, 9198 were identified with CH, giving a prevalence of 1/2047. In 19.0 million newborns screened in the same period, 1638 had PKU, with a prevalence of 1/11 572. An increasing number of neonates have been subjected to neonatal screening in China annually during this period. Data from Zhejiang Neonatal Screening Center showed that the recall rate of neonates suspected with CH and PKU was 95.52% in 2007. Confirmatory tests were performed and treatments were initiated in most of the neonates with CH and PKU within a month after birth.More governmental support at different levels is needed to make neonatal screening more efficient. The screening should be improved with a satisfactory control system including shorter time of report and a higher recall rate."
15056270,"BACKGROUND: Antiglomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) disease is an uncommon disease, especially among Asian population. Many reports and studies on this condition in the Caucasian population are available, but little information exists on anti-GBM disease in Asians. To study the incidence and clinical characteristics of anti-GBM disease among Chinese patients, we reviewed our experience of anti-GBM disease in our hospital (Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong) from 1992 to 2003. METHODS: All patients who were admitted for acute renal impairment, which was caused by crescentic glomerulonephritis associated with linear immunoglobulin G (IgG) staining on immunofluorescence, were included in the analysis. Serum anti-GBM antibodies were detected by either enzyme-linked immunofluorescence or indirect immunofluorescence. Ten patients were treated for anti-GBM disease during this 11-year period, yielding an incidence of approximately 0.6 cases per million population per year. RESULTS: In this cohort, anti-GBM disease predominantly affected older patients (mean age: 58.6 +/- 21.7 years). Eight patients were aged between 60 and 80 years and there was a female preponderance (M:F = 2:8). The 1-year renal and patient survival was 15% (95% CI 0-40%) and 70% (95% CI 42-98%), respectively. Most patients presented with non-specific symptoms as well as impaired renal function. Detection of anti-GBM antibody provided a good screening test for the disease. Antiglomerular basement membrane antibodies were not detected in two patients. All but two patients received steroid, cyclophosphamide and intensive plasmapheresis therapy. Haemoptysis occurred in four patients (40%), and usually lagged behind the renal presentation and commencement of treatment. Six patients required long-term dialysis after the acute disease. Three patients died from the disease, two died from pulmonary complications and one died suddenly after a partial recovery of renal function. CONCLUSION: Antiglomerular basement membrane disease is uncommon among the Chinese population. It predominantly affects older patients, and prognosis is poor. Long-term preservation of renal function after the initial attack is unusual."
21823196,"BACKGROUND:Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), a rare and rapidly progressive subtype of peripheral T-cell lymphoma, has been reported following TNF-α-blocker therapy. To better understand this relationship, we conducted an epidemiologic study in the Kaiser Permanente membership. METHODS:The retrospective cohort study was conducted among Northern California members of all ages. The Kaiser Permanente Cancer Registry, supplemented with review of medical charts and pathology slides, was used to identify and confirm cases of HSTCL. Medical histories were obtained, and we computed the standardized incidence rate for the 7-year period 2000-2006, when immunohistochemical staining was fully established throughout the health plan for diagnosing lymphoma. RESULTS:Six cases were diagnosed during 2000-2006, for an annual age-standardized incidence rate of 0.3 (95%CI, 0.11-0.65) per million person-years. One case had a prior diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS); another had a prior diagnosis of Crohn's disease treated with steroids, thiopurine and infliximab. CONCLUSION:Prior cases of HIV/AIDS-linked HSTCL are uncommon in the existing literature. Multiple case reports of HSTCL in the setting of Crohn's disease treated with anti-TNF plus thiopurine have been published, but HSTCL is rare, making epidemiologic assessments difficult."
8808215,"BACKGROUND:The clinical course of primary hyperoxaluria (PH) is greatly variable and diagnosis is often delayed. Little is known about the overall occurrence and current prognosis. METHODS:We evaluated all known patients with PH residing and observed in Switzerland during the last 15 years with the help of a survey among Swiss nephrologists. RESULTS:Of the 25 patients observed between 7/79 and 6/94 in Switzerland, 18 were alive in 1994-14 on conservative therapy and four on renal replacement therapy (RRT). Twenty-two patients had PH type 1; the exact type was not determined in three. The estimated prevalence of PH (type 1) is 2 per million population; the minimal incidence is 1 per 100,000 live births. Diagnosis was delayed by 8 years (median) except in infants. Five patients were pyridoxine sensitive. According to life table analysis, 20% of patients were in end-stage renal failure (ESRF) and 10% had died by the age of 15 years, and 50% were in ESRF and 20% dead at 25 years. Prognosis has improved: Five of 13 patients died during the first half of the observation period as opposed to two of 20 in the second part. CONCLUSIONS:Overall prognosis appears better than hitherto believed considering the large clinical spectrum of PH. Greater awareness of PH is needed to improve further long-term prognosis."
10083645,"INTRODUCTION: Townes-Brocks syndrome is constituted by a multi-systemic pattern of congenital anomalies with autosomal dominant inheritance. The most characteristic defects are those affecting hearing and the auricle, anal atresia and thumb anomalies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We present the epidemiological characteristics of six cases of Townes-Brocks syndrome identified in the consecutive series of 25,967 malformed live born infants detected among 1,431,368 live births surveyed by the ECEMC (Spanish Collaborative Study of Congenital Malformations) between April 1976 and June 1997. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The minimal estimated frequency of Townes-Brocks syndrome in our data is 0.42 cases per 100,000 liveborn infants. These infants have low birth weights. Similar to other published studies, we have observed in our cases a wide variation in the clinical expression of the syndrome, showing great inter-family, as well as intrafamily variability."
19642710,"Parents of 1,105 male and 283 female children with fragile X syndrome described functional skill attainment in eating, dressing, toileting, bathing/hygiene, communication, articulation, and reading. The majority of adult children had mastered many skills independently. Most adults were verbal, used the toilet, dressed, ate independently, bathed, and used a towel independently. However, some skills were not as well-developed, such as using complex sentences, reading, or speaking at a typical rate. As expected, significant differences were found between males and females. The findings highlight major skill attainments, identify skills that should be the target of specific intervention programs, suggest variable trajectories to be tested more precisely through direct assessments and longitudinally, and provide baseline data for treatment studies."
25066220,"BACKGROUND: Hirschsprung's disease is a congenital gut motility disorder, characterised by the absence of the enteric ganglion cells along the distal gut. The aim of this study was to describe the epidemiology of Hirschsprung's disease, including additional congenital anomalies, total prevalence, trends, and association with maternal age. METHODS: Cases of Hirschsprung's disease delivered during 1980 to 2009 notified to 31 European Surveillance of Congenital Anomaly registers formed the population-based case-series. Prevalence rates and 95% confidence intervals were calculated as the number of cases per 10,000 births. Multilevel Poisson regression was performed to investigate trends in prevalence, geographical variation and the association with maternal age. RESULTS: There were 1,322 cases of Hirschsprung's disease among 12,146,210 births. The total prevalence was 1.09 (95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.15) per 10,000 births and there was a small but significant increase in prevalence over time (relative risk = 1.01; 95% credible interval, 1.00-1.02; p = 0.004). There was evidence of geographical heterogeneity in prevalence (p < 0.001). Excluding 146 (11.0%) cases with chromosomal anomalies or genetic syndromes, there were 1,176 cases (prevalence = 0.97; 95% confidence interval, 0.91-1.03 per 10,000 births), of which 137 (11.6%) had major structural anomalies. There was no evidence of a significant increased risk of Hirschsprung's disease in cases born to women aged ≥35 years compared with those aged 25 to 29 (relative risk = 1.09; 95% credible interval, 0.91-1.31; p = 0.355). CONCLUSION: This large population-based study found evidence of a small increasing trend in Hirschsprung's disease and differences in prevalence by geographic location. There was also no evidence of an association with maternal age."
25182137,"Meckel-Gruber Syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive lethal ciliopathy characterized by the triad of cystic renal dysplasia, occipital encephalocele and postaxial polydactyly. We present the largest population-based epidemiological study to date using data provided by the European Surveillance of Congenital Anomalies (EUROCAT) network. The study population consisted of 191 cases of MKS identified between January 1990 and December 2011 in 34 European registries. The mean prevalence was 2.6 per 100,000 births in a subset of registries with good ascertainment. The prevalence was stable over time, but regional differences were observed. There were 145 (75.9%) terminations of pregnancy after prenatal diagnosis, 13 (6.8%) fetal deaths, 33 (17.3%) live births. In addition to cystic kidneys (97.7%), encephalocele (83.8%) and polydactyly (87.3%), frequent features include other central nervous system anomalies (51.4%), fibrotic/cystic changes of the liver (65.5% of cases with post mortem examination) and orofacial clefts (31.8%). Various other anomalies were present in 64 (37%) patients. As nowadays most patients are detected very early in pregnancy when liver or kidney changes may not yet be developed or may be difficult to assess, none of the anomalies should be considered obligatory for the diagnosis. Most cases (90.2%) are diagnosed prenatally at 14.3 ± 2.6 (range 11-36) gestational weeks and pregnancies are mainly terminated, reducing the number of LB to one-fifth of the total prevalence rate. Early diagnosis is important for timely counseling of affected couples regarding the option of pregnancy termination and prenatal genetic testing in future pregnancies."
15016750,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS:Little is known about the epidemiology of malignant digestive endocrine tumours. The aim of this study was to report on their incidence and management in a well defined population. METHODS:Data were obtained from the population based Digestive Cancer Registry of Burgundy (France) over a 24 year period. Incidence rates were calculated by sex, age groups, and period of diagnosis. Treatment and stage at diagnosis were also investigated. Prognosis was determined using crude and relative survival rates. A multivariate relative survival analysis was performed. RESULTS:Between 1976 and 1999, 229 cases were recorded. Age standardised incidence rates were 0.76/100,000 for men and 0.50/100,000 for women. They increased over time in both sexes. The resectability rate was 74.1%. Among recorded cases, 26.6% did not extend beyond the organ, 20% had lymph node metastases, and 53.3% had visceral metastases or were unresectable. There was no improvement in the resection rate or in the stage at diagnosis over the study period. The overall relative survival rate was 66.9% at one year, 50.4% at five years, and 40.6% at 10 years. Stage at diagnosis, age at diagnosis, and subsite were independent significant prognostic factors. CONCLUSIONS:Although their incidence is increasing, malignant digestive endocrine tumours remain a rare cancer, representing 1% of digestive cancers. Stage at diagnosis and prognosis at a population level are worse than those reported in hospital series. In the short term, new therapeutic possibilities represent the best way to improve their prognosis."
7886470,"Handigodu disease is a new syndrome of familial spondyloepi(meta)physeal dysplasia. It is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. The disease is prevalent in a localised area of South India. On the basis of detailed clinical, anthropometric and radiological investigations of 234 affected individuals, it has been observed that different clinical presentations reflect variation in the severity of the disease. All of them could be explained as being caused by defective development of bones as a result of monogenic disorder."
25946030,"CONTEXT: Patients with hypopituitarism of various etiologies have excess mortality. The mortality in patients with nonfunctioning pituitary adenoma (NFPA), regardless of pituitary function, is less well studied. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to investigate mortality in patients with NFPA and to examine whether age at diagnosis, gender, tumor treatments, or hormonal deficiencies influence the outcome. DESIGN: NFPA patients were identified and followed up in nationwide health registries in Sweden, 1987-2011. The criteria for identification were tested and validated in a subpopulation of the patients. SETTINGS: This was a nationwide, population-based study. PATIENTS: A total of 2795 unique patients with NFPA (1502 men, 1293 women) were identified and included in the study. Mean age at diagnosis was 58 years (men, 60 y; women, 56 y) and mean follow-up time was 7 years (range 0-25 y). INTERVENTION: There were no interventions. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) and annual incidence rates were calculated using the Swedish population as reference and presented with 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: Annual incidence of NFPA was 20.3 (18.8-21.9) cases per 1 million inhabitants. During the observation period, 473 patients died against an expected 431, resulting in an SMR of 1.10 (1.00-1.20). Patients diagnosed at younger than 40 years of age had an increased SMR of 2.68 (1.23-5.09). The SMR for patients with hypopituitarism (n = 1500) was 1.06 (0.94-1.19), and for patients with diabetes insipidus (n = 145), it was 1.71 (1.07-2.58). The SMR was increased in women with NFPA (1.29; 1.11-1.48) but not in men (1.00; 0.88-1.12). Women, but not men, with a diagnosis of hypopituitarism and/or diabetes insipidus also had an increased mortality ratio. SMRs due to cerebrovascular (1.73; 1.34-2.19) and infectious diseases (2.08; 1.17-3.44) were increased, whereas the SMR for malignant tumors was decreased (0.76; 0.61-0.94). CONCLUSIONS: This nationwide study of patients with NFPA showed an overall excess mortality in women and in patients with a young age at diagnosis. Increased mortality was seen for cerebrovascular and infectious diseases."
20466570,"Maple syrup urine disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of branched-chain amino acids metabolism with a worldwide frequency of 1/185,000 live newborns. In Portugal, the incidence of the disease has not been assessed. Based on the review of the cases diagnosed by tandem mass spectrometry an incidence of 1/86,800 live newborns was estimated in Portugal, indicating that the disease is more frequent in this country than reported in most populations."
18684116,"The neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs) are the commonest neurodegenerative disorders of children. The aims of this study were to determine the incidence of NCL in Newfoundland, identify the causative genes, and analyze the relationship between phenotype and genotype. Patients with NCL diagnosed between 1960 and 2005 were ascertained through the provincial genetics and pediatric neurology clinics. Fifty-two patients from 34 families were identified. DNA was obtained from 28/34 (82%) families; 18 families had mutations in the CLN2 gene, comprising five different mutations of which two were novel. One family had a CLN3 mutation, another had a novel mutation in CLN5, and five families shared the same mutation in CLN6. One family was misdiagnosed, and in two, molecular testing was inconclusive. Disease from CLN2 mutations had an earlier presentation (p = 0.003) and seizure onset (p < 0.001) compared with CLN6 mutation. There was a slower clinical course for those with CLN5 mutation compared with CLN2 mutation. NCL in Newfoundland has a high incidence, 1 in 7353 live births, and shows extensive genetic heterogeneity. The incidence of late infantile NCL, 9.0 per 100,000 (or 1 in 11,161) live births, is the highest reported in the world."
9161949,"BACKGROUND:It is believed that the incidence of cystic fibrosis (CF) among Asiatic races, including the Japanese, is very rare. This epidemiological study was carried out to investigate the incidence of CF in Japan. METHODS:We collected literature describing CF cases among pure Japanese and found 124 cases reported as CF during the 43 years from 1951, when the first case was reported, to 1993. Only 104 cases (57 male and 47 female patients) of 124 cases met our diagnostic criteria. RESULTS:A simple calculation based on the number of reported CF cases and of live births after 1980 suggested that the incidence of CF is about 1 in 350,000 in the Japanese population. Twenty-nine (27.9% of the total) of 30 patients diagnosed in the neonatal period presented symptoms of meconium ileus, an incidence higher than that reported for the white population. CONCLUSIONS:Our study results suggest that the incidence of CF in the Japanese population is even rarer than had been estimated before and that there is a genetic difference between northern European and Japanese populations."
21956287,"The designation, DYT4, was assigned to an Australian family with whispering dysphonia. The role of known causes of dystonia has not been comprehensively investigated in this family, nor has the possible relationship with Wilson disease (WND) in 2 siblings. Eighteen family members were neurologically examined, and DNA samples were obtained. Linkage analysis was performed to DYT1, DYT6, DYT7, DYT11, DYT13, DYT15, and ATP7B with microsatellite markers and the THAP1 (DYT6), PRKRA (DYT16), and ATP7B (WND) genes were sequenced. Reevaluation of the family identified 9 living affected family members, 6 of whom are newly affected. Phenotypic expression was variable, ranging from isolated spasmodic dysphonia (often with mild craniocervical dystonia) to severe generalized dystonia. Two newly described features included an extrusional tongue dystonia and a unique ""hobby horse gait."" Genetic analyses excluded all tested loci. Haplotype analysis of the ATP7B region resulted in three different combinations of the two parental alleles in the 8 investigated siblings of the 2 deceased WND patients, indicating that the fourth combination (of two mutated alleles) had occurred only in the deceased WND patients. On these two alleles, we identified a missense (c.2297C>G; p.T766R) and a splice-site mutation (IVS5+1G>T). The c.2297C>G mutation was detected in 3 affected and 4 unaffected family members, whereas the IVS5+1G>T mutation was detected in 1 affected and unaffected family member. Five DYT4 patients carried neither mutation. DYT4 is a familial form of dystonia unrelated to known dystonia genes and loci. ATP7B mutations do not segregate with the dystonia phenotype, indicating two independent genetic diseases in this family."
21510732,"Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD) is a rare disorder that can be misdiagnosed as idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and accounts for 5-10% of cases initially considered as idiopathic PAH. PVOD and idiopathic PAH share a similar clinical presentation, genetic background and hemodynamic profile. A definite diagnosis of PVOD necessitates a surgical biopsy, but since it represents a high-risk procedure in these patients, it is contraindicated. Therefore, a noninvasive diagnostic approach using chest high-resolution computed tomography, arterial blood gas analysis, pulmonary function tests and bronchoalveolar lavage is helpful to detect PVOD. PVOD is characterized by a poor prognosis and the possibility of developing severe pulmonary edema with specific PAH therapy. Lung transplantation remains the treatment of choice."
10519720,"OBJECTIVE:To study the epidemiology of pyridoxine dependent seizures and other forms of pyridoxine responsive seizures. DESIGN:Monthly notifications to the British Paediatric Surveillance Unit over two years. Questionnaire follow up. SETTING:UK and the Republic of Ireland. PATIENTS:Children aged 15 years or younger whose seizures respond to pyridoxine. INTERVENTIONS:None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:Numbers of children with definite, probable, and possible pyridoxine dependent seizures or other seizures responsive to pyridoxine. RESULTS:Point prevalence and birth incidence: 1/687 000 and 1/783 000, respectively (definite and probable cases); 1/317 000 and 1/157 000, respectively (all types of pyridoxine responsiveness). NOTIFICATIONS: Pyridoxine dependency: 14 definite, 9 probable, and 10 possible cases; neonatal seizures not meeting case definitions: 7; infantile spasms: 5. Eight of 18 families of definite/probable cases had 2 affected siblings. Just over a third had atypical presentations and just under a third had features and/or initial diagnoses of birth asphyxia and neonatal hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy. CONCLUSIONS:Pyridoxine dependency is rare. Atypical presentations are relatively frequent. A trial of pyridoxine is justified in all cases of early onset intractable seizures or status epilepticus, whatever the suspected cause."
19088488,"BACKGROUND: This systematic literature review of the epidemiology of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) identifies trends in incidence rates by age, study method and cause of disease. It is important to have a reliable estimate of incidence to determine and investigate any changes: no previous systematic reviews of GBS have been found. METHODS: After critical assessment of the reliability of the reported data, incidence rates were extracted from all relevant papers published between 1980 and 2008, identified through searches of Medline, Embase and Science Direct. RESULTS: Sixty-three papers were included in this review; these studies were prospective, retrospective reviews of medical records or retrospective database studies. Ten studies reported on the incidence in children (0-15 years old), and found the annual incidence to be between 0.34 and 1.34/100,000. Most studies investigated populations in Europe and North America and reported similar annual incidence rates, i.e. between 0.84 and 1.91/100,000. A decrease in incidence over the time between the 1980s and 1990s was found. Up to 70% of cases of GBS were caused by antecedent infections. CONCLUSIONS: Our best estimate of the overall incidence of GBS was between 1.1/100,000/year and 1.8/100,000/year. The incidence of GBS increased with age after 50 years from 1.7/100,000/year to 3.3/100,000/year."
18853416,"BACKGROUND: The National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program has proven to be a significant resource in US neuroendocrine tumor (NET) epidemiology. Norway also holds a robust and detailed cancer registry: the Norwegian Registry of Cancer (NRC). METHODS: SEER NET data were compared with corresponding NRC data in the time period 1993 to 2004 to determine whether there are differences in NET epidemiology between Norway and the United States. RESULTS: The SEER and NRC reported 17,312 and 2030 NETs, respectively. The overall Caucasian SEER NET incidence was 4.44, compared with 3.24 in the NRC. In the SEER white subset, bronchopulmonary NETs were the most common (incidence = 1.42; 32% of all NETs), compared with small intestinal NETs in the NRC (0.81; 26%). A marked increase in SEER NET incidence (37%-40%) was observed in the period 2000 to 2004, compared with 1993 to 1997; an even more pronounced increase (72%) was seen in the NRC. African Americans exhibited a remarkably high overall NET incidence of 6.50; furthermore, among African Americans, rectal NETs were most common (1.65; 27%). Small intestinal NET incidence was approximately 30% higher in men compared with women in all populations. The highest 5-year survival rates were for rectal NETs (74%-88%) in both databases, whereas prostatic NETs had the worst outcome (0%-23%). At diagnosis, NETs were localized in 27% to 46% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: NET incidence in the US Caucasian population and in Norway is similar, but considerably higher ( approximately 50%) among African Americans. NETs have been regarded as indolent tumors; however, the 5-year survival is only approximately 55%."
16638642,"BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies of childhood epilepsy are of importance to compare incidence and prevalence rates, age distribution, inheritance, seizure types, epilepsy syndromes and treatment strategies. AIM: To perform an epidemiological study on children with epilepsy in a Swedish county using current ILAE classifications and a recent proposal. METHODS: A population-based study was performed using the hospital data register to select children aged 1 month to 16 years with the diagnosis 'convulsions' or 'epilepsy' recognized between January 1996 and December 2000. Only patients with active epilepsy were included. RESULTS: Two hundred and five children met the study criteria on the prevalence day 31st December, 2000. The total prevalence rate was 3.4/1,000 with a peak prevalence in the age group 8-11 years. The incidence year 2000 was 40/100,000. Additional neuroimpairments were registered in 47.3%. A majority of the patients, 54.0%, had focal or focal plus secondarily generalized seizures. A named syndrome could be diagnosed in 49.4%. The most common syndrome was rolandic epilepsy occurring in 17.0%. Childhood absence epilepsy occurred in 5.9%. Different disorders associated with epilepsy were found in 31.7%. The most common associated phenomenon was malformation of cortical development. Antiepileptic drug treatment was used in 81.0%, the most common first choice being valproate. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence and incidence rates in this strictly delineated study are lower than those found in other epidemiological studies. Together with many divergences between reported studies concerning frequencies of different items, the results apparently depend on design, e.g. differences in age groups included, inclusion criteria used, and general methodology."
16287144,"Mucolipidosis type IV (MLIV) is a neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorder that occurs in an increased frequency in the Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) population. The frequency of the disease in this population has been established by the testing of 66,749 AJ subjects in the Dor Yeshorim program, a unique premarital population-screening program designed for the Orthodox Jewish community. A carrier rate of 0.0104 (95% C.I 0.0097-0.011) was found. The distribution of the 2 AJ founder mutations, namely, c.416-2A>G and c.1_788del, was determined to be 78.15% and 21.85%, respectively. Three novel mutations were identified in non-Jewish MLIV patients, a missense mutation c.1207C>T, p.Arg403Cys; a 2bp deletion, c.302_303delTC; and a nonsense, c.235C>T, Gln79X."
7762595,"From a series of 1265 individuals with different craniosynostoses hospitalized between 1976 and 1993, 260 probands with nonsyndromic unilateral (181) or bilateral (79) coronal synostosis were analysed. The prevalence of craniosynostoses was estimated as 1 in 2100 children. In the group of coronal synostosis, family history was obtained on 192 probands in 180 pedigrees. The male:female ratio was 1:2. The average paternal age was 32.7 +/- 6.4 years, which is significantly higher than normal. In 26 of the 180 pedigrees, a high degree of familial aggregation was observed, giving a 14.4% figure of familial cases. The bicoronal synostoses were significantly more often familial than the unicoronal synostoses. Segregation analysis of these families leads to the conclusion that coronal synostosis is transmitted as a dominant disorder with 0.60 penetrance and 61% of sporadic cases."
23535757,"Q fever, a zoonotic disease caused by the bacterium Coxiella burnetii, can cause acute or chronic illness in humans. Transmission occurs primarily through inhalation of aerosols from contaminated soil or animal waste. No licensed vaccine is available in the United States. Because many human infections result in nonspecific or benign constitutional symptoms, establishing a diagnosis of Q fever often is challenging for clinicians. This report provides the first national recommendations issued by CDC for Q fever recognition, clinical and laboratory diagnosis, treatment, management, and reporting for health-care personnel and public health professionals. The guidelines address treatment of acute and chronic phases of Q fever illness in children, adults, and pregnant women, as well as management of occupational exposures. These recommendations will be reviewed approximately every 5 years and updated to include new published evidence."
19888300,"Coffin-Lowry syndrome (CLS) is a syndromic form of X-linked mental retardation, which is characterized in male patients by psychomotor and growth retardation and various skeletal anomalies. Typical facial changes and specific clinical and radiological signs in the hand are useful aids in the diagnosis. CLS is caused by mutations in the RPS6KA3 gene located at Xp22.2, which encodes RSK2, a growth-factor-regulated protein kinase. RPS6KA3 mutations are extremely heterogeneous and lead to loss of phosphotransferase activity in the RSK2 kinase, most often because of premature termination of translation."
23334384,"Adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT) deficiency, cystinuria, Dent disease, familial hypomagnesemia with hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis (FHHNC), and primary hyperoxaluria (PH) are rare but important causes of severe kidney stone disease and/or chronic kidney disease in children. Recurrent kidney stone disease and nephrocalcinosis, particularly in pre-pubertal children, should alert the physician to the possibility of an inborn error of metabolism as the underlying cause. Unfortunately, the lack of recognition and knowledge of the five disorders has frequently resulted in an unacceptable delay in diagnosis and treatment, sometimes with grave consequences. A high index of suspicion coupled with early diagnosis may reduce or even prevent the serious long-term complications of these diseases. In this paper, we review the epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, treatment, and outcome of patients with APRT deficiency, cystinuria, Dent disease, FHHNC, and PH, with an emphasis on childhood manifestations."
22429443,"BACKGROUND: Gaucher disease (GD) is due to deficiency of the glucocerebrosidase enzyme. It is panethnic, but its presentation reveals ethnicity-specific characteristics. METHODS: We evaluated the distribution, and clinical and genetic characteristics of GD patients in the Iberian Peninsula (IP). We analysed geographical distribution, demographic, genetic and clinical data, age at diagnosis, type, and years of therapy in 436 GD patients from the IP. RESULTS: The prevalence of GD was 1/149,000 inhabitants; 88.3% were type 1, 6.7% type 2, and 5.0% type 3. The mean age at diagnosis in type 1 was 28.7 years. A total of 72.7% were classified as having mild forms, 25.5% moderate, and 1.7% severe. Anemia and thrombocytopenia were present in 56% and 55%, respectively. Bone disease and hepatomegaly were reported in 62% and 68%, respectively, and were more likely in asplenic than in non-splenectomized patients. Sixty-nine mutant alleles were identified, and five mutations accounted for 75% of the GBA alleles. Several patients described in our series had interesting phenotypes. A total of 58.7% of patients had received enzyme replacement therapy and 12.6% were treated with miglustat. CONCLUSIONS: A broad spectrum of GBA mutations is present in the IP, with 98.2% of type 1 GD being mild and 23.0% never treated. These data highlight genetic and phenotypic heterogeneities among geographic populations."
14872461,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalences of polyarteritis nodosa (PAN), microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), Wegener's granulomatosis (WG), and Churg-Strauss syndrome (CSS). METHODS: Cases were collected in Seine-St. Denis County, a northeastern suburb of Paris, which has 1,093,515 adults (> or =15 years), 28% of whom are of non-European ancestry. The study period encompassed the entire calendar year 2000. Cases were identified by general practitioners, the departments of all the public hospitals and 2 large private clinics, and the National Health Insurance System. The Chapel Hill nomenclature was used to define MPA, and American College of Rheumatology criteria to define WG and CSS; PAN was diagnosed based on clinical laboratory, histological and/or angiographic findings. Three-source capture-recapture analysis was performed to correct for incomplete case ascertainment. RESULTS: A total of 75 cases were retained and capture-recapture analysis estimated that 23.8 cases had been missed by any 1 of the 3 sources. Accordingly, prevalences per 1,000,000 adults (95% confidence interval [95% CI]) were estimated to be 30.7 (95% CI 21-40) for PAN, 25.1 (95% CI 16-34) for MPA, 23.7 (95% CI 16-31) for WG, and 10.7 (95% CI 5-17) for CSS. The overall prevalence was 2.0 times higher for subjects of European ancestry than for non-Europeans (P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first prevalence estimates for these 4 vasculitides for a multiethnic, urban population. The significantly higher prevalence observed for Europeans may infer a genetic susceptibility of Caucasians. Compared with previous estimates based mostly on rural populations, the higher frequency of PAN and the lower frequency of WG might suggest specific environmental etiologic factors."
22835603,"Lymphomas are solid tumours of the immune system. Hodgkin's lymphoma accounts for about 10% of all lymphomas, and the remaining 90% are referred to as non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Non-Hodgkin lymphomas have a wide range of histological appearances and clinical features at presentation, which can make diagnosis difficult. Lymphomas are not rare, and most physicians, irrespective of their specialty, will probably have come across a patient with lymphoma. Timely diagnosis is important because effective, and often curative, therapies are available for many subtypes. In this Seminar we discuss advances in the understanding of the biology of these malignancies and new, available treatments."
22994460,"BACKGROUND: Eosinophilic oesophagitis (EoE) has evolved from a supposedly rare entity to one whose incidence rates are approaching that of inflammatory bowel disease. The factors responsible for this apparent increase in the incidence remain obscure. AIM: To assess various endoscopist and pathologist factors that might affect the frequency of EoE being detected in a well-defined North American population. HYPOTHESIS: Increased endoscopist and pathologist awareness has contributed to the increased clinical recognition of EoE. METHODS: Cases of EoE were identified systematically using population-based pathology and endoscopy databases from January 2004 to December 2008 in Calgary, Canada (population 1.25 million). EoE frequency was estimated with time trend analysis. Characteristics of individual endoscopists (n = 45) were compared with diagnostic rates. RESULTS: Crude population incidence of EoE increased from 2.1 per 10(5) in 2004 to 11.0 per 10(5) in 2008: an annual increase of 39% (P < 0.0001). The frequency in men was 4.5 times higher than in women (95% CI: 3.51-5.76). In patients presenting with dysphagia oesophageal biopsy rates increased from 17.0% in 2004 to 41.3% of EGDs in 2008: an annual rise of 26% (P < 0.0001). On multivariate regression analysis, those endoscopists with higher biopsy rates were more likely to make the diagnosis of EoE (P = 0.008). To include or exclude the diagnosis, typical histological features of EoE were reported more often by pathologists in 2008 as compared to 2004 (P = 0.01 & P < 0.0001 respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of eosinophilic oesophagitis continues to rise in the general population, in part due to increasing oesophageal biopsy rates and a more detailed histological evaluation of specimens. The biopsy rate of an endoscopist is an indicator for a higher diagnostic yield."
30376835,"BACKGROUND:Autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease (ADTKD) caused by mutations in the UMOD gene (ADTKD-UMOD) is considered rare and often remains unrecognised. We aimed to establish the prevalence of genetic kidney diseases, ADTKD and ADTKD-UMOD in adult chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients, and to investigate characteristic features. METHODS:We sent questionnaires on family history to all patients with CKD stages 3-5 in our tertiary renal centre to identify patients with inherited renal disease. Details on clinical and family history were obtained from patient interviews and clinical records. Sanger sequencing of the UMOD gene was performed from blood or saliva samples. RESULTS:2027 of 3770 sent questionnaires were returned. 459 patients reported a family history, which was consistent with inherited kidney disease in 217 patients. 182 non-responders with inherited kidney diseases were identified through a database search. Of these 399 individuals, 252 had autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), 28 had ADTKD, 25 had Alports, and 44 were unknown, resulting in 11% of CKD 3-5 patients and 19% of end-stage renal disease patients with genetic kidney diseases. Of the unknown, 40 were genotyped, of whom 31 had findings consistent with ADTKD. 30% of unknowns and 39% of unknowns with ADTKD had UMOD mutations. Altogether, 35 individuals from 18 families were found to have ten distinct UMOD mutations (three novel), making up 1% of patients with CKD 3-5, 2% of patients with end-stage renal disease, 9% of inherited kidney diseases and 56% with ADTKD. ADTKD-UMOD was the most common genetic kidney disease after ADPKD with a population prevalence of 9 per million. Less proteinuria and haematuria, but not hyperuricaemia or gout were predictive of ADTKD-UMOD. The main limitations of the study are the single-centre design and a predominantly Caucasian population. CONCLUSIONS:The prevalence of genetic kidney diseases and ADTKD-UMOD is significantly higher than previously described. Clinical features poorly predicted ADTKD-UMOD, highlighting the need for genetic testing guided by family history alone."
16763904,"As judged by tandem mass spectrometry blood spot screening, the incidence of medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency is 1:14 600 (CI 95%: 1:13 500-1:15 900) in almost 8.2 million newborns worldwide and is 2- to-3 fold higher than that identified in the same populations after clinical presentation. In mass-screened newborn populations, the 985A>G (K329E) mutation accounts for 54-90% of disease alleles, with homozygotes representing about 47-80% of MCAD deficiency cases. Worldwide, octanoylcarnitine levels are an effective primary screen for MCAD deficiency in newborns. Newborns homozygous for the 985A < G mutation have higher octanoylcarnitine levels than do those compound heterozygous for 985A < G and those with other genotypes. Time of sampling after birth also significantly affects octanoylcarnitine levels in MCAD-deficient newborns. Tandem mass spectrometry newborn blood spot screening for MCAD deficiency is accurate and effective, reduces morbidity and mortality, and merits expansion to other populations worldwide."
18616627,"AIM: To estimate the incidence of urea cycle diseases (UCDs) in Finland and determine the course of the various disorders as well as the outcome. METHODS: The original data were collected in the years 1998-2001. The diagnoses made after 2001, as well as the current status of the patients, were updated by surveys in the spring of 2007. RESULTS: We found a total of 55 cases of UCDs in Finland by 2007: 30 cases of ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency, 20 of argininosuccinate lyase (ASL) deficiency, 3 of carbamyl phosphate synthetase (CPS-I) deficiency, 1 of type 1 citrullinaemia and 1 of argininaemia. The estimated total incidence of UCDs was 1:39 000. The incidences of individual disorders were: OTC deficiency 1:62 000, ASL deficiency 1:144 000, CPS deficiency 1:539 000 and citrullinaemia 1:1 616 000. Eighteen (33%) of the patients with a diagnosis of UCD have died, most during their first hyperammonaemic crisis. One patient with OTC deficiency has had a liver transplant. Neurological symptoms of varying severity are common among these patients, particularly those with ASL deficiency. CONCLUSION: The first survey on the incidence of UCDs in Finland shows some differences in the occurrence rates compared to other countries. Hyperammonaemia, and the neurological symptoms caused by it, can be avoided in most patients with late-onset UCDs with a standard treatment. However, in patients with ASL deficiency, the development of neurological symptoms seems to be inevitable in spite of careful treatment and avoidance of hyperammonaemia."
18278521,"We present the findings of a prospective cohort study of babies born with antenatally detected urinary tract abnormalities (AUTAs) between 1999-2003 and compare the outcomes with those of an earlier cohort born between 1989 and 1993. All infants with a fetal anteroposterior renal pelvic diameter (APRPD) > or =7 mm in the third trimester or other urinary tract abnormality underwent a detailed postnatal ultrasound scan and other investigations as indicated. The incidence of AUTAs was significantly greater in the more recent cohort (7.6/1000 vs. 3/1000 live births; p<0.05). Of the 350 infants on which we had data, 48.6% (170/350) were in the non-specific dilatation (NSD) category, and vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) was detected in 12%. Restricting investigations to those who had an APRPD > or =10 mm at >30 weeks of gestation could have reduced the number with NSD in the more recent cohort (26/115; 25%), but 25% of those with pelviureteric junction hold-up and 50% with VUR would have been missed. Significantly fewer patients in the more recent cohort underwent surgery (7 vs. 21%; p<0.001). There is a trend towards larger APRPDs on third trimester scans being associated with more significant pathology, but there is a lot of clinical overlap. The study highlights the need for cautious antenatal counselling combined with an assurance to prospective parents that postnatal investigations will be performed in a stepwise manner based on the initial postnatal ultrasound scan and clinical findings."
2063900,"Service providers for children in the state of North Dakota were surveyed to determine the prevalence rate of Rett syndrome (RS). Five patients with definite RS were identified in a population of 203,801 children (98,932 girls) 0-18 years of age yielding a prevalence rate of RS of 1 in 40,760 in North Dakota children. For girls the rate of RS is 1 in 19,786. Similar surveys of other states using comparable modes of ascertainment will be important as points of comparison for prevalence rates of RS."
29606556,"Few reliable data exist on the prevalence of skeletal muscle channelopathies. We determined the minimum point prevalence of genetically-defined skeletal muscle channelopathies in the Netherlands and report their mutation spectrum. Minimum point prevalence rates were calculated as number of genetically-confirmed skeletal muscle channelopathy patients (CLCN1, SCN4A, CACNA1S and KCNJ2 gene mutations) in the Netherlands (1990-2015) divided by the total number of at-risk individuals. Rates were expressed as cases/100.000 and 95% confidence intervals were calculated based on Poisson distribution. Results of standardized genetic diagnostic procedures were used to analyze mutation spectra. We identified 405 patients from 234 unrelated pedigrees, resulting in a minimum point prevalence of 2.38/100.000 (95% CI 2.16-2.63) for skeletal muscle channelopathies in the Netherlands. Minimum point prevalence rates for the disease groups, non-dystrophic myotonia and periodic paralysis, were 1.70/100.000 and 0.69/100.000 respectively. Sixty-one different CLCN1 mutations (including 12 novel mutations) were detected in myotonia congenita. Twenty-eight different SCN4A missense mutations (including three novel mutations) were identified in paramyotonia congenita/sodium channel myotonia, hypokalemic periodic paralysis and hyperkalemic periodic paralysis. Four different CACNA1S missense mutations were detected in hypokalemic periodic paralysis and five KCNJ2 missense mutations in Andersen-Tawil syndrome. The minimum point prevalence rates for genetically-defined skeletal muscle channelopathies confirm their rare disease status in the Netherlands. Rates are almost twice as high as in the UK and more in line with pre-genetic prevalence estimates in parts of Scandinavia. Future diagnostic and therapeutic studies may benefit from knowledge of the mutation spectrum of skeletal muscle channelopathies."
7617979,"Finland and Hokkaido resemble each other; the four season climate with cold winters and cool summers is the same as is the frequency of tuberculosis. The size of the population is almost the same. From the 1984 Japanese nationwide sarcoidosis survey we got the data from Hokkaido (288 patients) in order to compare the information with similarly collected data in Finland from 1984 (1,378 patients). The crude prevalence of sarcoidosis was 28.2 per 100,000 in Finland and 3.7 per 100,000 in Hokkaido. The annual incidence was 11.4 per 100,000 in Finland and 1.0 per 100,000 in Hokkaido. The sex distribution was similar; 63% vs 67% women in Finland and Hokkaido, respectively. At diagnosis the Hokkaidoan patients were significantly younger. In Hokkaido more cases were detected via mass X-ray survey (43% vs 34%). Among symptomatic patients eye symptoms were more frequent in Hokkaido, whereas respiratory and joint symptoms and erythema nodosum were more frequent in Finland. Bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy (BHL) was equally distributed (82% vs 84% whereas parenchymal lesions were seen more often in Finland (49% vs 25%) as well as peripheral lymphadenopathy (16% vs 8%)."
3500313,"The prevalence and mode of inheritance of major genetic eye diseases have been investigated in China since the establishment of the Section of Ophthalmic Genetics of the Chinese Society of Genetics. Mass screening of genetic eye diseases has been undertaken in many districts in China, covering more than 700,000 people, and more than 5000 pedigrees of genetic eye diseases have been collected and analysed all over China. Based on these data, the prevalence and mode of inheritance of dyschromatopsia, degenerative myopia, retinitis pigmentosa, congenital ptosis, congenital microphthalmos, congenital cataract, congenital glaucoma, Leber's optic atrophy, corneal dystrophy, congenital nystagmus, coloboma of the eye, congenital aniridia, retinoblastoma, macular dystrophy, simple myopia, primary glaucoma, and strabismus have been investigated, and the results are presented."
11083271,"OBJECTIVE: To determine if changes in the incidence, prevalence, and clinical presentation of Wegener's granulomatosis (WG) have occurred in the stable population of northern Norway during a 15-year period. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study using hospital discharge records from all 11 hospitals in the region and the databases of the 2 pathology departments in the area. Only patients fulfilling the American College of Rheumatology 1990 criteria for WG were included in the study, and demographic and clinical data at diagnosis were recorded. Incidence, point prevalence, and period prevalence rates were estimated for three 5-year periods. RESULTS: Fifty-five patients (62% male) with a median age at diagnosis of 50 years (range 10-84 years) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The annual incidence/ million population increased from 5.2 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 2.7-9.0) during 1984-1988 to 12.0 (95% CI 8.0-17.3) during 1994-1998. The point prevalence/million increased from 30.4 (95% CI 16.6-51.0) to 95.1 (95% CI 69.1-129.0). The highest incidence rate occurred in men ages 65-74 years. There were no significant period differences in age, first organ involved, delay of diagnosis, or disease activity, but fewer patients had malaise and renal insufficiency during the earliest time period. No seasonal variation in the onset of WG was present, although we noted a pattern of annual fluctuation. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of WG has tripled in northern Norway over the last 15 years. While more efficacious therapy may explain part of this increase, we also found a significant trend toward increased incidence over that period. The incidence rate over the last 5 years is the highest reported so far, while the clinical presentation has remained unchanged."
3829443,"By a systemic search of osteopetrosis in the county of Funen, Denmark, the prevalence was 5.5/100,000 inhabitants. The study disclosed 33 patients of whom 32 had the mild, autosomal dominant form of osteopetrosis. Two obligate carriers, who had the genotype but were not phenotypically affected, were disclosed. There was a great variation in the clinical manifestations; 39% were asymptomatic. The age of first appearance of symptoms also varied widely (8-76 years), with a tendency to increasing symptoms with aging. The frequency of fractures was low. Plasma inorganic phosphate was low in 7% of the patients, and plasma acid phosphatase was increased in 39%."
25758562,"Hereditary angioedema due to C1-inhibitor deficiency (C1-INH-HAE type I) or dysfunction (C1-INH-HAE type II) is a rare disease characterized by recurrent episodes of edema with an estimated frequency of 1:50,000 in the global population without racial or gender differences. In this study we present the results of a nationwide survey of C1-INH-HAE patients referring to 17 Italian centers, the Italian network for C1-INH-HAE, ITACA.Italian patients diagnosed with C1-INH-HAE from 1973 to 2013 were included in the study. Diagnosis of C1-INH-HAE was based on family and/or personal history of recurrent angioedema without urticaria and on antigenic and/or functional C1-INH deficiency.983 patients (53% female) from 376 unrelated families were included in this survey. Since 1973, 63 (6%) patients diagnosed with C1-INH-HAE died and data from 3 patients were missing when analysis was performed. Accordingly, the minimum prevalence of HAE in Italy in 2013 is 920:59,394,000 inhabitants, equivalent to 1:64,935. Compared to the general population, patients are less represented in the early and late decades of life: men start reducing after the 5(th) decade and women after the 6(th). Median age of patients is 45 (IQ 28-57), median age at diagnosis is 26 years (IQ 13-41). C1-INH-HAE type 1 are 87%, with median age at diagnosis of 25 (13-40); type 2 are 13% with median age at diagnosis of 31 (IQ 16-49). Functional C1INH is ≤50% in 99% of patients. Antigen C1INH is ≤50% in 99% of type 1. C4 is ≤50% in 96% of patients. The chance of having C1-INH-HAE with C4 plasma levels >50% is < 0.05.This nationwide survey of C1-INH-HAE provides for Italy a prevalence of 1:64,935. C1-INH-HAE patients listed in our database have a shorter life expectancy than the general population. An increased awareness of the disease is needed to reduce this discrepancy. Measurement of C4 antigen can exclude diagnosis of C1-INH-HAE with an accuracy > 95%. This parameter should be therefore considered for initial screening in differential diagnosis of angioedema."
12189496,"Megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts (MLC) is a progressive inherited neurological disorder characterized by macrocephaly, deterioration in motor functions and cerebellar ataxia. In Israel the disease is found in an increased frequency among Libyan Jews. The disease is caused by mutations in the MLC1 gene, which encodes a putative CNS membrane transporter. We describe three novel mutations (p.G59E, p.P92S, and 134_136insC) in seven MLC families. One of these mutations, p.G59E, was found in the vast majority of MLC patients in Israel. Screening of 200 normal Libyan Jewish individuals for the p.G59E mutation, revealed a carrier rate of 1/40 compared with an expected carrier rate of 1/81. Several explanations could account for this difference the most likely one is an admixture of the Libyan Jewish population."
4001877,"Nationwide prevalence and mortality rates in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) were estimated using a computer file of all hospital discharge records and cause of death statistics from 1972 to 1978. Age-specific and sex-specific prevalence rates obtained from 1976 to 1978 and mortality rates from 1972 to 1978. In December 1978 the prevalence of SLE was 28:100 000. The overall mortality rate was 4.7 per million person-years in 1972-78. Active lupus nephritis, vascular events and infections were the most frequent causes of death in SLE patients."
18430269,"OBJECTIVE:Large, population-based assessments of systemic sclerosis (SSc) prevalence and comorbidity in the United States (US) are rare. We explored autoimmune disease and other comorbidity patterns among SSc patients in the US from 2001 to 2002 and compared these with controls. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS:Two US datasets with patient-level medical and drug claims were used to assess SSc prevalence and comorbidity: IMS Health Integrated Administrative Claims Database (IMS Health) and the MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters Database (MarketScan). SSc patients and comorbidities were identified by International Classification of Diseases (ICD), 9th revision diagnostic codes appearing on medical claims. Patients without SSc diagnostic codes (controls) were selected and matched 4:1 to SSc patients based on sex, age, Census Bureau region, and previous insurance coverage. The prevalence relative risk (RR) statistic compared comorbidity occurrence between SSc patients and controls, with 95% confidence intervals estimated using the Mantel-Haenszel method. Several sensitivity analyses tested methods used for identifying SSc cases and the prevalence of comorbidities. RESULTS:In both databases, SSc prevalence was 0.05% using the standard population model, 0.03% under sensitivity analysis. Among SSc patients the risks for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and multiple sclerosis (MS) were notably higher across datasets than for those without SSc: RR 3.2-6.6 for MS, RR 2.1-2.2 for IBD, in MarketScan and IMS Health, respectively (p < 0.05 for all). The chronic disease burden of SSc patients was much higher than that of controls, as confirmed by two chronicity measures (Chronic Disease Score, Elixhauser Comorbidity Index). The risks for cardiovascular, renal, liver and several neuropsychiatric diseases were higher for SSc patients across both datasets. Sensitivity analyses supported these findings. CONCLUSIONS:These data provide a population-based estimate of US prevalence of SSc and document the higher risk for certain other autoimmune diseases among SSc patients when compared to controls. Patients with SSc also had a higher chronic disease burden than those without SSc. These findings are limited by the unknown validity of ICD-9 codes for SSc case identification, unbalanced regional representation, and a likely 'healthy worker' effect in these databases."
23916348,"OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to estimate the sex- and age-specific incidence rates of major autoimmune rheumatic diseases (ARDs) in Taiwan using a population longitudinal database. METHODS: A health insurance database containing the records of 1,000,000 beneficiaries of Taiwan National Health Insurance from 2005 to 2009 was used. RESULTS: Between 2005 and 2009, the overall incidence rate of the major ARDs was 29.8 (95% CI = 28.3-31.3) per 100,000 person-years. Among the ARDs studied, the incidence of rheumatoid arthritis (RA; per 100,000 person-years) was highest (17.2, 95% CI = 16.1-18.4) and was followed by Sjögren's syndrome (11.8, 95% CI = 10.8-12.7), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE; 7.2, 95% CI = 6.5-8.0), systemic sclerosis (SS; 1.1, 95% CI = 0.8-1.4), vasculitis (1.0, 95% CI = 0.7-1.3), Behçet disease (0.9, 95% CI = 0.6-1.1), dermatomyositis (DM; 0.7, 95% CI = 0.5-1.0), and polymyositis (PM; 0.6, 95% CI = 0.4-0.8). Females had a higher incidence ratio than did males, but a significant female/male incidence ratio was only observed for SLE (8.5, 95% CI = 6.1-12.0), Sjögren's syndrome (6.0, 95% CI = 4.8-7.6), RA (3.0, 95% CI = 2.6-3.5), and SS (2.6, 95% CI = 1.4-4.6). CONCLUSIONS: ARDs are three to four times more common among women than among men in the Chinese population of Taiwan. The incidence of RA was the highest, followed by Sjögren's syndrome and SLE, while the incidence of Behçet disease was the lowest in this study. This nationwide, population-based, longitudinal epidemiological study of ARDs in Taiwan provides data for future global comparisons and may provide clues as to the etiology of these diseases."
21826194,"BACKGROUND: The exact overall incidence of sarcoma and sarcoma subtypes is not known. The objective of the present population-based study was to determine this incidence in a European region (Rhone-Alpes) of six million inhabitants, based on a central pathological review of the cases. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: From March 2005 to February 2007, pathology reports and tumor blocks were prospectively collected from the 158 pathologists of the Rhone-Alpes region. All diagnosed or suspected cases of sarcoma were collected, reviewed centrally, examined for molecular alterations and classified according to the 2002 World Health Organization classification. Of the 1287 patients screened during the study period, 748 met the criteria for inclusion in the study. The overall crude and world age-standardized incidence rates were respectively 6.2 and 4.8 per 100,000/year. Incidence rates for soft tissue, visceral and bone sarcomas were respectively 3.6, 2.0 and 0.6 per 100,000. The most frequent histological subtypes were gastrointestinal stromal tumor (18%; 1.1/100,000), unclassified sarcoma (16%; 1/100,000), liposarcoma (15%; 0.9/100,000) and leiomyosarcoma (11%; 0.7/100,000). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The observed incidence of sarcomas was higher than expected. This study is the first detailed investigation of the crude incidence of histological and molecular subtypes of sarcomas."
10102298,"PURPOSE: To determine the chromosomal location and to identify the gene causing a type of retinitis punctata albescens, called Bothnia dystrophy, found in a restricted geographic area in northern Sweden. METHODS: Twenty patients from seven families originating from a restricted geographic area in northern Sweden were clinically examined. Microsatellite markers were analyzed in all affected and unaffected family members. Direct genomic sequencing of the gene encoding cellular retinaldehyde-binding protein was performed after the linkage analysis had been completed. RESULTS: Affected individuals showed night blindness from early childhood with features consistent with retinitis punctata albescens and macular degeneration. The responsible gene was mapped to 15q26, the same region to which the cellular retinaldehyde-binding protein gene has been assigned. Subsequent analysis showed all affected patients were homozygous for a C to T substitution in exon 7 of the same gene, leading to the missense mutation Arg234Trp. Analysis of marker haplotypes suggested that all cases had a common ancestor who carried the mutation. CONCLUSIONS: A missense mutation in the cellular retinaldehyde-binding protein gene is the cause of Bothnia dystrophy. The disease is a local variant of retinitis punctata albescens that is common in northern Sweden due to a founder mutation."
23052600,"Recent genetic studies suggest a Sardinian type of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Thus, ALS incidence, prevalence and survival were investigated in a large population of Sardinians aimed to disclose population-specific patterns and their temporal changes. This is a population-based incidence and prevalence study in northern and central Sardinia, insular Italy (over 700,000 population). Incidence rates were computed for the time interval 1995-2009 and by quinquennia. Prevalence was computed for prevalence days 31 December 2004 and 2009. Onset-based survival for 1995-2009 is also reported. All ALS patients (El Escorial Criteria) in the study area were retrospectively included. The ALS crude incidence from 2005-2009 was 2.5 (95 % CIs: 0.1, 4.9), 3.4 in men and 1.6 in women. Onset occurred most often between the age of 65-74 years in men and 55-64 years in women. The ALS incidence tended to increase over the period 1995-2009. The mean age at onset was 61.7 years with no difference based on gender, varying significantly from 59.9 years in 1995-1999 to 63.9 years in 2005-2009. On December 31, 2009, the ALS crude prevalence was 10.8 per 100,000 (95 % CIs: 8.6, 13.1), 13.8 in men and 8.0 in women, whereas it was 6.3 per 100,000 (95 % CIs: 4.1, 8.6) on December 31, 2004 (M:F ratio of 0.95). Mean survival from onset was 37.0 months, with no difference based on gender, and a tendency to decrease during the period 1995-2009, in relation to type and age of onset. The population-based incidence and prevalence data of ALS in Sardinians indicate an increase of the disease occurrence over the past 40 years, providing support for a population-specific variant of ALS in Sardinia."
27699872,"The epidemiology of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) differs among countries. Here, we present the first epidemiological indices determined for Poland.Twenty-one haematological centres participated in the study. Patients diagnosed with MDS and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) with 20-29% blasts were enrolled. Data collection was conducted for strictly predefined period.The overall crude incidence rate for all MDS subtypes was 1.95 (95% CI, 1.81-2.09) per 100 000 person-years: 2.46 (95% CI, 2.24-2.69) for males and 1.47 (95% CI, 1.31-1.65) for females; after excluding AML cases, the indices were as follows: 2.35 (95% CI, 2.08-2.66) for males and 1.27 (95% CI, 1.08-1.5) for females. Prevalence rate was 6.2 per 100 000 persons (95% CI, 5.96-6.45), that is 6.86 (95% CI, 6.49-7.24) for males and 5.58 (95% CI, 5.26-5.92) for females. Both incidence and prevalence increased with increasing age. The most frequently diagnosed MDS subtype was refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia (RCMD), responsible for 30.3% of all newly diagnosed MDSs.RCMD is the most frequent MDS subtype in Poland. Incidence and prevalence indices are lower than those reported for other populations, which probably results from inadequate diagnosis of potential cases of this disease."
12518276,"We performed the first population-based clinical and molecular genetic study of Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) in a population of 2,173,800 individuals in the North East of England. We identified 16 genealogically unrelated families who harbor one of the three primary mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations that cause LHON. Two of these families were found to be linked genetically to a common maternal founder. A de novo mtDNA mutation (G3460A) was identified in one family. The minimum point prevalence of visual failure due to LHON within this population was 3.22 per 100,000 (95% CI 2.47-3.97 per 100,000), and the minimum point prevalence for mtDNA LHON mutations was 11.82 per 100,000 (95% CI 10.38-13.27 per 100,000). These results indicate that LHON is not rare but has a population prevalence similar to autosomally inherited neurological disorders. The majority of individuals harbored only mutant mtDNA (homoplasmy), but heteroplasmy was detected in approximately 12% of individuals. Overall, however, approximately 33% of families with LHON had at least one heteroplasmic individual. The high incidence of heteroplasmy in pedigrees with LHON raises the possibility that a closely related maternal relative of an index case may not harbor the mtDNA mutation, highlighting the importance of molecular genetic testing for each maternal family member seeking advice about their risks of visual failure."
24433508,"BACKGROUND: We conducted a monthly epidemiological survey to determine the birth prevalence of Robin sequence (RS) and the use of various therapeutic approaches for it. METHODS: Between August 2011 and July 2012, every pediatric department in Germany was asked to report new admissions of infants with RS to the Surveillance Unit for Rare Pediatric Diseases in Germany. RS was defined as retro- or micrognathia and at least one of the following: clinically evident upper airway obstruction including recessions, snoring or hypoxemia; glossoptosis; feeding difficulties; failure to thrive; cleft palate or RS-associated syndrome. Hospitals reporting a case were asked to return an anonymized questionnaire and discharge letter. RESULTS: Of 96 cases reported, we received detailed information on 91. Of these, 82 were included; seven were duplicates and two erroneous reports. Given 662,712 live births in Germany in 2011, the birth prevalence was 12.4 per 100,000 live births. Therapeutic approaches applied included prone positioning in 50 infants, followed by functional therapy in 47. Conventional feeding plates were used in 34 infants and the preepiglottic baton plate (PEBP) in 19. Surgical therapy such as mandibular traction was applied in 2 infants, tracheotomy in 3. CONCLUSION: Compared to other cohort studies on RS, surgical procedures were relatively rarely used as an initial therapy for RS in Germany. This may be due to differences in phenotype or an underrecognition of upper airway obstruction in these infants."
8013895,"We present comparative epidemiologic characteristics of five congenital abnormalities that have been suggested to result from midline abnormal developmental disturbances: esophageal atresia with or without tracheoesophageal fistula (EA/TEF), imperforate anus with or without fistula (IA/F), omphalocele (OM), bladder exstrophy (BE), and diaphragmatic hernia (DH). The purpose was to assess the extent of epidemiologic similarities among these five defects. Data were collected as part of a population-based case-control study of infants with these defects born to mothers residing in Maryland, Washington, D.C., or Northern Virginia from 1980 through 1987. The estimated annual birth prevalences (per 10,000 live births) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of these five defects were 0.40 (0.26-0.61) for BE, 1.34 (1.08-1.67) for OM, 1.59 (1.29-1.95) for DH, 2.11 (1.76-2.53) for EA/TEF, and 2.97 (2.55-3.46) for IA/F. The birth prevalence of IA/F and DH increased between 1980 and 1987. In contrast to the other four defects, DH showed a significant male preponderance (rate ratio 1.57, 95% CI 1.03-2.47), a significant white excess (rate ratio white:other, 1.56, 95% CI 1.00-2.48), and a lower proportion of multiple associated defects (30% vs. 46-61%). We concluded from this study that the descriptive epidemiology of diaphragmatic hernia is different from that of the other four defects. This finding may imply differences in etiologic and pathogenetic mechanisms underlying DH."
16547084,"AIMS: To determine the incidence and severity of symptomatic toxoplasma infection presenting during childhood due to congenital or postnatally acquired infection. METHODS: Between 2002 and 2004, newly diagnosed children (<16 years) with signs or symptoms of congenital or ocular toxoplasmosis were reported by clinicians to the British Paediatric and Ophthalmic Surveillance Units or by toxoplasma referral laboratories. Confirmed cases were estimated to have a greater than 50% probability of congenital and/or ocular toxoplasmosis, based on clinical and serological findings. RESULTS: Thirty eight children had confirmed toxoplasma infection. Twenty two (58%) were classified with congenital infection (cumulative incidence for England and Wales 1.62[corrected]/100,000 live births; 95% CI 0.85[corrected] to 2.83[corrected]), of whom 2 (9%) were stillborn, 7 (32%) live births had intracranial abnormalities and/or developmental delay (5 of whom had retinochoroiditis), and 10 (45%) had retinochoroiditis with no other abnormalities reported. A further 16 (42%) children were classified as infected after birth; all had retinochoroiditis. CONCLUSIONS: The low burden of symptomatic congenital toxoplasmosis combined with the lack of evidence of an effective treatment support current policy not to offer prenatal or neonatal screening for toxoplasma infection. Primary prevention strategies need to address acquisition of infection in childhood which accounts for half the ocular disease due to toxoplasma infection in children in the UK and Ireland."
15333286,"OBJECTIVE:To determine the prevalence of physician-diagnosed systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in a national population-based sample in the United States. METHODS:Data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) were used to estimate the prevalence of self-reported physician-diagnosed SLE. Adult participants (age > or = 17; sample n = 20,050) were asked if they had been diagnosed with SLE by a physician. All medications currently being taken by survey participants were recorded. Two definitions were used to classify participants with SLE: self-reported physician diagnosis and self-reported physician diagnosis and a current prescription for antimalarials, corticosteroids, or other immunosuppressive medications. RESULTS:The prevalence of SLE in adults age > or = 17 based on self-reported physician diagnosis was 241 per 100,000 (95% confidence interval [CI] 130-352). The prevalence of SLE in adults age > or = 17 based on self-reported physician diagnosis and current prescription for antimalarials, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive medications was 53.6 per 100,000 (95% CI 12.2-95.0). Among adult women, the prevalence of treated SLE was 100 per 100,000 (95% CI 19.8-179.3). CONCLUSIONS:Projecting a prevalence of 100 per 100,000 to the population of the United States, approximately 108,300 adult women had a self-reported physician diagnosis of SLE and were receiving specific treatment in 2000. This estimate is a reasonable lower boundary, as it does not include undiagnosed persons or those not being treated with antimalarials, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive medications."
19237701,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the temporal patterns of incidence and demographic characteristics of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in Piemonte and Valle d'Aosta, Italy, in the 10-year period 1995 through 2004. METHODS: The Piemonte and Valle d'Aosta Register for ALS (PARALS) is a prospective register collecting all cases of ALS incident in two regions of northwestern Italy (population: 4,332,842) since 1995. The cases are identified using several concurrent sources. ALS diagnosis is based on El Escorial criteria. RESULTS: During the 10-year period of observation, 1,347 residents in the study area were diagnosed with ALS. In 1,260 of these cases, a diagnosis of definite or probable ALS was made at presentation or during the follow-up. The mean annual crude incidence rate was 2.90/100,000 population (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.72 to 3.09). The crude prevalence rate (December 31, 2004) was 7.89 (95% CI, 7.09 to 8.75)/100,000 population. According to the capture-recapture estimation, 27 patients were unobserved, thus increasing the annual observed crude incidence to 2.96/100,000 population. The incidence rate did not show any relevant variation during the 10-year period of the study and was constantly higher among men. The demographics and clinical features did not change between the 1995-1999 and the 2000-2004 cohorts, with the notable exception of the mean time delay from onset to diagnosis, which was significantly decreased in the last 5-year period. CONCLUSIONS: In the examined decade, the incidence of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in Italy has been stable, and the clinical and demographic characteristics of the patients have shown no relevant modifications."
20829610,"Overt Cushing's syndrome is a rare disorder with an annual incidence of 2-3/million of which benign adrenal adenomas account for 0.6/million. The female:male ratio is 3:1. Preliminary data indicate a high proportion of subclinical Cushing's syndrome in certain risk populations such as patients with type 2 diabetes or osteoporosis. The clinical implications of these observations are presently unclear. Surgery remains first line treatment for overt disease and initial cure or remission is obtained in 65-85% of patients with Cushing's disease. Late recurrences, however, occur in up to 20% and the risk does not seem to plateau even after 20 years of follow-up. A 2- to 3-fold increase in mortality is observed in most studies, and this excess mortality seems confined to patients in whom initial cure was not obtained. Cushing's syndrome continues to pose diagnostic and therapeutic challenges and life-long follow-up is mandatory."
10731299,"BACKGROUND: Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis is a rare disease in which a surfactant-like phospholipid-rich protein accumulates in the lungs. The disease is amenable to effective therapy by total lung lavage. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prevalence, ethnic distribution and course of PAP in Israel. METHODS: A countrywide survey was conducted during which pulmonologists were questioned about patients with PAP. The patients were examined and their charts, radiological images, pathological slides and physiological data were reviewed. RESULTS: The survey yielded 15 patients (8 females) during the period 1976-98 (14 in the last decade), giving a prevalence of 3.7 x 10(6) and an incidence of 0.36 x 10(6)/year. Mean age of the patients was 33 +/- 13 years (range 0.5-46 years). Seven patients were North African (two were siblings), four were from Iraq and two were Arabs; there was only one Ashkenazi Jew (a child). Symptoms at the onset were dyspnea and chest pain. Spontaneous remission occurred in at least 3 patients, and 10 patients required 1-4 bronchoalveolar lavage treatments. The subjective and physiological response was favorable, but there was less consistent radiological improvement. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of PAP in Israel is approximately 3.7 x 10(6). Most cases occurred in Jews who had immigrated from North Africa or Iraq, and two were siblings. The prevalence among the Arab population appears to be similar. This clustering suggests the existence of a genetic predisposition. The course of the disease appears to be similar to that reported elsewhere."
18755888,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The prevalence and natural history of hereditary pancreatitis (HP) remain poorly documented. The aims of this study were to assess genetic, epidemiological, clinical and morphological characteristics of HP in an extensive national survey. METHODS: A cohort comprising all HP patients was constituted by contacting all gastroenterologists and paediatricians (response rate 84%) and genetics laboratories (response rate 100%) in France (60,200,000 inhabitants). Inclusion criteria were the presence of mutation in the cationic trypsingen gene (PRSS1 gene), or chronic pancreatitis in at least two first-degree relatives, or three second-degree relatives, in the absence of precipitating factors for pancreatitis. RESULTS: 78 families and 200 patients were included (181 alive, 6673 person-years, males 53%, alcoholism 5%, smoking 34%). The prevalence was 0.3/100,000 inhabitants. PRSS1 mutations were detected in 68% (R122H 78%, N29I 12%, others 10%). Penetrance was 93%. Median age at first symptom, diagnosis and date of last news, were 10 (range 1-73), 19 (1-80) and 30 (1-84) years, respectively. HP was responsible for pancreatic pain (83%), acute pancreatitis (69%), pseudocysts (23%), cholestasis (3%), pancreatic calcifications (61%), exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (34%, median age of occurrence 29 years), diabetes mellitus (26%, median age of occurrence 38 years) and pancreatic adenocarcinoma (5%, median age 55 years). No differences in clinical and morphological data according to genetic status were observed. 19 patients died, including 10 directly from HP (8 from pancreatic adenocarcinoma). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of HP in France is at least 0.3/100,000. PRSS1 gene mutations are found in 2/3 with a 93% penetrance. Mutation type is not correlated with clinical/morphological expression. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is the cause of nearly half the deaths."
19725436,"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), associated with congenital heart disease (CHD), usually results from a systemic-to-pulmonary shunt. Eisenmenger syndrome (ES) is characterised by severe irreversible PAH and reversal of a previous systemic-to-pulmonary shunt. A national registry of ES patients was initiated to optimise patient care and to provide epidemiological information regarding PAH and CHD in Belgium.All ES patients, older than 18 years, were selected through the local databases of ten centres in Belgium. After written informed consent, demographic, clinical, biochemical, technical, and treatment data were entered into the web-based registry.Ninety-one patients were included in the registry. Mean age was 36 +/- 11 years (range 18-59 years). Complete atrioventricular septal defect (N=26, 28.6%), followed by ventricular septal defect (N=25, 27.5%) were the commonest defects. Forty-five percent were patients with Down syndrome. Down patients were younger (32 +/- 9 versus 40 +/- 12 years; P = 0.039), had worse functional capacity (class II/III ratio: 15/16 versus 21/8; P = 0.035) and received significantly less specific PAH treatment (7% versus 38%; P = 0.002).Through the national Eisenmenger registry, 91 adult patients with ES were identified (estimated prevalence II per million inhabitants). Almost half of them were Down patients. Although having worse functional capacity, significantly less Down patients were receiving specific PAH treatment."
9662850,"OBJECTIVE: Four major characteristics (cryptophthalmos, syndactyly, genital anomalies and affected siblings) and eight minor characteristics (alterations of the nose, ears, larynx, oral clefts, umbilical hernia, renal agenesis, skeletal anomalies and mental retardation) have been defined for the diagnosis of Fraser syndrome. The generally accepted criterion for the diagnosis is at least the presence of 2 major and one minor characteristic, or one major and four minor characteristics. The etiology of the syndrome is autosomal recessive and siblings are frequently affected. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We show the characteristics of the 7 cases of Fraser syndrome identified in the consecutive series of 1,405,374 liveborn infants and 9,042 stillborn children surveyed by the Spanish Collaborative Study of Congenital Malformations (ECEMC) between April 1976 and March 1997. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The minimal estimated frequency of Fraser syndrome is 0.43 per 100,000 liveborn infants and 11.06 per 100,000 stillbirths. As has been shown in other case studies, we have observed a wide clinical expression of this syndrome. At present it is possible to prenatally detect some of the characteristics of Fraser syndrome through ultrasound examination of eyes, digits and kidneys. Four out of the 7 cases we present here were gypsies and the frequency of the syndrome among liveborn gypsy infants is 129.3 times higher than among the non-gypsy population. Therefore, given that the frequency of the gene is higher in the gypsy population than in other ethic groups, it is recommended that a special search among gypsies for the identification of this and other autosomal recessive syndromes be performed."
23173875,"BACKGROUND: Toxoplasmosis is caused by infection with the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii. Acute infections in pregnant women may be transmitted to the fetus and cause severe illness. The purpose of this study was to establish a dedicated surveillance network (DSN) for congenital toxoplasmosis (CT) in Greece, in order to assess the birth prevalence of CT. METHODS: A DSN of thirty clinicians was established for reporting CT cases from hospitals throughout Greece. The clinicians were selected on the basis that there was a high possibility the suspected cases would be referred to them from district hospitals or private clinics. Suspected cases of CT were reported on a monthly basis with a zero reporting card during a surveillance period from April 2006 to December 2009. A questionnaire was sent for any suspected case to record information including demographic parameters, clinical signs and symptoms and laboratory results. Serological and molecular confirmation of cases was performed by the Pasteur Hellenic Institute. All newborns suspected of CT received treatment and were serologically and clinically followed up for one year. RESULTS: The monthly response rate reached 100%, although only after reminders sent to 65% of the participant physicians. Sixty-three suspected CT cases were recorded by the DSN during the study period including fourteen confirmed and seven probable cases. Ten cases (47.6%) presented with symptoms at birth. Chorioretinitis was the most prominent manifestation, occurring in five symptomatic CT cases (50%). No other symptoms appeared by the end of the one year clinical follow up. No case was recorded by the existing surveillance system of the Hellenic Center of Disease Control and Prevention (HCDCP) during the same time period. Birth prevalence was estimated at 0.45, 0.51 and 0.51 per 10,000 births for 2007, 2008 and 2009 respectively. The incidence rate of symptomatic CT at birth was estimated at 0.10 cases per 10,000 births per year in Greece (for the period 2007-2009). CONCLUSION: The DSN for CT proved to be more sensitive than the classical notification system, easy in application and very efficient in reporting rare diseases such as CT. Similar DSNs could be used to provide useful information on other rare diseases."
9782755,"In Denmark, the Faroe Islands, and Greenland, comprehensive screening of newborns for phenylketonuria and congenital hypothyroidism has been carried out for 20 years. The screening programme has detected 98 and 356 patients, respectively, corresponding to incidences of 1:12,000 and 1:3,400. The future savings on health care expenditures resulting from one year of neonatal screening are estimated to be 196 million DKK in present day value, which is 28 times higher than the cost of screening. The screening samples are stored in a biobank, which is used in diagnosis of congenital diseases and infant deaths and for development of future screening methods. It is desirable to expand the existing screening programme to include a range of rare inherited metabolic diseases, which collectively are frequent. This is realistic with the advent of tandem mass spectrometry, which allows cost-effective simultaneous screening for a group of inborn errors of metabolism."
20865031,"coats disease is an uncommon form of retinal telangiectasis. Published case series mostly originate from tertiary referrals centres and may provide a skewed view of disease severity. We conducted a prospective population-based study of Coats disease in the United Kingdom to ascertain the incidence and provide a more representative picture.the study was conducted through the British Ophthalmological Surveillance Unit. This first paper reports the features at presentation; gender, mode of presentation, visual acuity, anterior and posterior segment findings, amount of retinal exudation, and disease staging.a total of 55 eligible cases of Coats disease were identified giving an estimated population incidence of 0.09 per 100.000 of the population. All cases were unilateral and 85% were male. Mean age at presentation was 146 months (median 96 months). The mean age of diagnosis was markedly different with differing mechanisms of presentation. Cases presenting with leucocoria or strabismus presented early whereas subjective visual loss presented much later. A large proportion of eyes (44%) were blind at diagnosis. The great majority of eyes (71%) had 6 or fewer clock hours of retinal exudation. More severe forms/stages of Coats disease were more common in the youngest patients.compared with published studies of Coats disease, we have found milder disease severity at presentation. This is most likely because of the population-based nature of our study reflecting the full disease spectrum. A large proportion of eyes with Coats have poor visual acuity and disease severity is worse in younger patients."
21641615,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the associations between the first-tier-screening laboratory methods and criteria and the birth prevalence of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), phenylketonuria (PKU), and the sickle hemoglobinopathies occurring in the United States between 1991 and 2000. STUDY DESIGN: By using validated data from the National Newborn Screening and Genetics Resource Center, we fit Poisson regression models with laboratory methods and criteria used in every year for each state for each disorder. We also examined whether there was an overall change in birth prevalence over the decade and whether there was an effect resulting from obligatory second screenings. RESULTS: There were no associations among any of the factors and the birth prevalence of PKU in this decade. Use of the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was more likely than any other laboratory method to identify cases of CAH (OR 1.16; 95% CI 1.04-1.30), but no other factors were associated with this disorder. None of the factors examined were associated with the birth prevalence rates of any of the sickle hemoglobinopathies. CONCLUSION: There were no substantial changes in the birth prevalence rates of PKU, CAH, or the sickle hemoglobinopathies over the study period despite rapid changes in technology."
25060283,"Mucopolysaccharidosis type VI (MPS VI - Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome) is a globally rare lysosomal storage disease caused by a deficiency of arylsulfatase B. However, in Monte Santo, a poor and isolated rural region in Northeast Brazil with large family sizes and high rates of community endogamy and parental consanguinity (α = 0.00483), 9 living and 4 now deceased individuals in 11 kindreds have been diagnosed with MPS VI, all with the same p.H178L missense founder mutation. A further 33 deceased persons have been identified by family members as exhibiting the disease phenotype. Detailed pedigrees were constructed for the 13 genomically confirmed MPS VI patients, with blood samples collected from 236 unaffected family members to determine the prevalence of the p.H178L mutation. A total of 98 (20.8%) mutant alleles and 374 (79.2%) normal alleles were identified, with 41.5% of the individuals heterozygous for the p.H178L mutation and 58.5% homozygous for the normal allele. A significant number of other family members with a 50 or 25% chance of being heterozygous for the p.H178L mutation were unavailable for testing. The data indicate a compelling case for community-based neonatal screening in conjunction with further initiatives among MPS VI family members to promote genetic education and genetic counselling."
16690699,"BACKGROUND: Inherited metabolic disorders (IMDs) are a heterogeneous group of genetic conditions mostly occurring in childhood. They are individually rare but collectively numerous, causing substantial morbidity and mortality. AIMS: To obtain up-to-date estimates of the birth prevalence of IMDs in an ethnically diverse British population and to compare these estimates with those of other published population-based studies. METHODS: Retrospective data from the West Midlands Regional Diagnostic Laboratory for Inherited Metabolic Disorders (Birmingham, UK) for the 5 years (1999-2003) were examined. The West Midlands population of 5.2 million is approximately 10% of the UK population. Approximately 11% of the population of the region is from black and ethnic minority groups compared with approximately 8% for the the UK. RESULTS: The overall birth prevalence was 1 in 784 live births (95% confidence interval (CI) 619 to 970), based on a total of 396 new cases. The most frequent diagnoses were mitochondrial disorders (1 in 4929; 95% CI 2776 to 8953), lysosomal storage disorders (1 in 5175; 95% CI 2874 to 9551), amino acid disorders excluding phenylketonuria (1 in 5354; 95% CI 2943 to 9990) and organic acid disorders (1 in 7962; 95% CI 3837 to 17 301). Most of the diagnoses (72%) were made by the age of 15 years and one-third by the age of 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: These results are similar to those of the comparison studies, although the overall birth prevalence is higher in this study. This is probably due to the effects of ethnicity and consanguinity and increasing ascertainment. This study provides useful epidemiological information for those planning and providing services for patients with IMDs, including newborn screening, in the UK and similar populations."
26463436,"OBJECTIVE:To investigate trends in the incidence of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), according to histologic subtypes, in Korean women between 1999 and 2012. METHODS:Data from the Korea Central Cancer Registry recorded between 1999 and 2012 were evaluated. The incidences of EOC histologic subtypes were counted. Age-standardized incidence rates (ASRs) and annual percentage changes (APCs) in incidence rates were calculated. Patient data were divided into three groups based on age (<40, 40 to 59, and >59 years), and age-specific incidence rates were compared. RESULTS:Overall, the incidence of EOC has increased. Annual EOC cases increased from 922 in 1999 to 1,775 in 2012. In 1999, the ASR was 3.52 per 100,000 and increased to 4.79 per 100,000 in 2012 (APC, 2.53%; p<0.001). The ASRs in 2012 and APCs between 1999 and 2012 for the four major histologic subtypes were as follows (in order of incidence): serous carcinoma (ASR, 2.32 per 100,000; APC, 4.34%; p<0.001), mucinous carcinoma (ASR, 0.73 per 100,000; APC, -1.05%; p=0.131), endometrioid carcinoma (ASR, 0.51 per 100,000; APC, 1.48%; p=0.032), and clear cell carcinoma (ASR, 0.50 per 100,000; APC, 8.13%; p<0.001). In the sub-analyses based on age, clear cell carcinoma was confirmed as the histologic subtype whose incidence had increased the most since 1999. CONCLUSION:The incidence of EOC is increasing in Korea. Among the histologic subtypes, the incidence of clear cell carcinoma has increased markedly across all age groups since 1999."
9887374,"In a national retrospective register study 112 patients with ocular albinism (OA) were identified, including 60 male patients with proven or presumed X-linked ocular albinism (XLOA). Based on the birth year cohorts 1960-1989, an XLOA point prevalence at birth of 1 in 60,000 live-born was calculated. We identified 14 XLOA families in the Danish population, and obtained DNA from affected persons in nine families. Mutation analysis of the OA1 gene demonstrated seven presumed pathogenic mutations in the nine families with XLOA: five single nucleotide substitutions predicting a change of conserved amino acids (G35D, L39R, D78V, W133R and E233K) when compared with the mouse OA1 homologue, one deletion leading to the skipping of exon 2, and one single nucleotide substitution expected to affect the 5' splice site of intron 2 were found. Subsequent genealogical investigations in the three families harbouring the same mutation disclosed that two of the three pedigrees belonged to the same family. All mutations predict crucial changes in the protein structure. Clinical examination failed to identify any phenotype-genotype pattern except a milder phenotype devoid of iris translucency in the patient with the 5'splice site mutation of intron 2."
12436195,"To clarify the epidemiology of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) in Japan, we performed a questionnaire survey. Two hundred eighty-six patients, including 154 from internal medicine, 100 from pediatrics, 21 from psychiatry, and 11 from other hospitals, were reported to have ALD between 1990 and 1999. The data on 154 patients revealed the phenotypic distribution to be as follows: childhood cerebral form (29.9%), adrenomyeloneuropathy (25.3%), adult cerebral form (21.4%), adolescent form (9.1%), olivo-ponto-cerebellar form (8.4%), presymptomatic form (4.5%), and symptomatic female patient (1.3%). The adult cerebral form and olivo-ponto-cerebellar form were more common in Japan than in North America and Europe. The incidence of X-linked ALD in Japan was estimated to be between 1 : 30,000 and 1 : 50,000 boys, similar to previous reports. About half of the patients with adrenomyeloneuropathy and the olivo-ponto-cerebellar phenotype developed cerebral involvement with a mean interval of 8.2 and 2.2 years after ALD onset, respectively. The family histories revealed that brothers and first cousins tended to show similar phenotypes, whereas nephews tended to develop symptoms earlier than uncles. These data will help in understanding the natural history of X-linked ALD."

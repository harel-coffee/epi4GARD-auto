32302469,"Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) is a hereditary neurodegenerative condition inherited through an autosomal recessive pattern. The incidence and carrier frequency of infantile TSD were found to be increased among French Canadians in specific areas of the province of Quebec or calculated from New England populations with French-Canadian heritage. No accurate infantile TSD carrier frequency for the whole French-Canadian population in Quebec has been published. In this study, we estimate the incidence and carrier frequency of infantile TSD in the Quebec French-Canadian population. The number of TSD cases was ascertained during the 1992-2015 period, as well as the number of births to mothers whose language of use is French. Seven cases of TSD have been diagnosed in Quebec during the period of ascertainment. This corresponds to an incidence of 1/218,144, which in turn corresponds to a carrier frequency of 1/234. In the same 24-year period, there are two French-Canadian couples who had a fetus prenatally diagnosed with TSD. If these cases are included, the incidence of TSD in the French-Canadian population of Quebec is 1/169,668 and the carrier frequency 1/206. These findings can be used for genetic counseling and policy decisions regarding carrier screening for TSD in populations of French-Canadian descent.",0.9988287091255188,True
29943104,"Tay-Sachs disease is an autosomal recessive type of lysosomal storage disorder. The disease is very rare in Turkey, with an incidence of 0.54/100,000. The clinical manifestations of Tay-Sachs disease include progressive developmental delay, seizures, deafness, blindness, spasticity, and dystonia, which are caused by the accumulation of gangliosides in the central nervous system. To date, only one case indicating the association between Tay-Sachs disease and central precocious puberty has been reported. Although the mechanism of this association is not clear, it is thought to be due to ganglioside accumulation in the central nervous system or the inhibition of the hypothalamic inhibiting pathway. Herein, we report two patients with genetically proven Tay-Sachs disease who developed central precocious puberty during follow-up. Pubertal development in patients affected by Tay-Sachs disease should be carefully assessed.",0.9981141090393066,True
30506202,"Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations of the HEXA gene resulting in the deficiency of hexosaminidase A (Hex A) and subsequent neuronal accumulation of GM2 gangliosides. Infantile TSD is a devastating and fetal neurodegenerative disease with death before the age of 3-5 years. A small proportion of TSD patients carry milder mutations and may present juvenile or adult onset milder disease. TSD is more prevalent among Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) individuals and some other genetically isolated populations with carrier frequencies of approximately ~1:27 which is much higher than that of 1:300 in the general population. Carrier screening and prenatal testing for TSD are effective in preventing the birth of affected fetuses greatly diminishing the incidence of TSD. Testing of targeted HEXA mutations by genotyping or sequencing can detect 98% of carriers in AJ individuals; however, the detection rate is much lower for most other ethnic groups. When combined with enzyme analysis, above 98% of carriers can be reliably identified regardless of ethnic background. Multiplex PCR followed by allele-specific primer extension is one method to test for known and common mutations. Sanger sequencing or other sequencing methods are useful to identify private mutations. For prenatal testing, only predefined parental mutations need to be tested. In the event of unknown mutational status or the presence of variants of unknown significance (VUS), enzyme analysis must be performed in conjunction with DNA-based assays to enhance the diagnostic accuracy. Enzymatic assays involve the use of synthetic substrates 4-methylumbelliferyl-N-acetyl-β-glucosamine (4-MUG) and 4-methylumbelliferyl-6-sulfo-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-β-D-glucopyranoside (4-MUGS) to measure the percentage Hex A activity (Hex A%) and specific Hex A activity respectively. These biochemical and molecular tests can be performed in both direct specimens and cultured cells from chorionic villi sampling or amniocentesis.",0.8231115341186523,True
30616450,"Tay-Sachs disease is an inherited lysosomal storage disease resulting from mutations in the lysosomal enzyme, β-hexosaminidase A, and leads to excessive accumulation of GM2 ganglioside. Tay-Sachs patients with the infantile form do not live beyond 2-4 years of age due to rapid, progressive neurodegeneration. Enzyme replacement therapy is not a therapeutic option due to its inability to cross the blood-brain barrier. As an alternative, small molecules identified from high-throughput screening could provide leads suitable for chemical optimization to target the central nervous system. We developed a new high-throughput phenotypic assay utilizing infantile Tay-Sachs patient cells based on disrupted lysosomal calcium signaling as a monitor of diseased phenotype. The assay was validated in a pilot screen on a collection of Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs to identify compounds that could reverse or attenuate the disease. Pyrimethamine, a known pharmacological chaperone of β-hexosaminidase A, was identified from the primary screen. The mechanism of action of pyrimethamine in reversing the defective lysosomal phenotype was by improving autophagy. This new high-throughput screening assay in patient cells will enable the screening of larger chemical compound collections. Importantly, this approach could lead to identification of new molecular targets previously unknown to impact the disease and accelerate the discovery of new treatments for Tay-Sachs disease.",0.6444298624992371,True
31076878,"BACKGROUND:Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by a lysosomal β-hexosaminidase A deficiency due to mutations in the HEXA gene. The late-onset form of disease (LOTS) is considered rare, and only a limited number of cases have been reported. The clinical course of LOTS differs substantially from classic infantile TSD. METHODS:Comprehensive data from 14 Czech patients with LOTS were collated, including results of enzyme assays and genetic analyses. RESULTS:14 patients (9 females, 5 males) with LOTS were diagnosed between 2002 and 2018 in the Czech Republic (a calculated birth prevalence of 1 per 325,175 live births). The median age of first symptoms was 21 years (range 10-33 years), and the median diagnostic delay was 10.5 years (range 0-29 years). The main clinical symptoms at the time of manifestation were stammering or slurred speech, proximal weakness of the lower extremities due to anterior horn cell neuronopathy, signs of neo- and paleocerebellar dysfunction and/or psychiatric disorders. Cerebellar atrophy detected through brain MRI was a common finding. Residual enzyme activity was 1.8-4.1% of controls. All patients carried the typical LOTS-associated c.805G>A (p.Gly269Ser) mutation on at least one allele, while a novel point mutation, c.754C>T (p.Arg252Cys) was found in two siblings. CONCLUSION:LOTS seems to be an underdiagnosed cause of progressive distal motor neuron disease, with variably expressed cerebellar impairment and psychiatric symptomatology in our group of adolescent and adult patients. The enzyme assay of β-hexosaminidase A in serum/plasma is a rapid and reliable tool to verify clinical suspicions.",0.6221079230308533,True
31283907,"Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) is a GM2 gangliosidosis lysosomal storage disease caused by a loss of lysosomal hexosaminidase-A (HEXA) activity and characterized by progressive neurodegeneration due to the massive accumulation of GM2 ganglioside in the brain. Here, we generated iPSCs derived from patients with TSD, and found similar potential for neural differentiation between TSD-iPSCs and normal iPSCs, although neural progenitor cells (NPCs) derived from the TSD-iPSCs exhibited enlarged lysosomes and upregulation of the lysosomal marker, LAMP1, caused by the accumulation of GM2 ganglioside. The NPCs derived from TSD-iPSCs also had an increased incidence of oxidative stress-induced cell death. TSD-iPSC-derived neurons showed a decrease in exocytotic activity with the accumulation of GM2 ganglioside, suggesting deficient neurotransmission in TSD. Our findings demonstrated that NPCs and mature neurons derived from TSD-iPSCs are potentially useful cellular models of TSD and are useful for investigating the efficacy of drug candidates in the future.",0.48470866680145264,False
31388111,"Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) (OMIM) is a neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorder caused due to mutations in the HEXA gene. To date, nearly 190 mutations have been reported in HEXA gene. Here, we have characterized 34 enzymatically confirmed TSD families to investigate the presence of novel as well as known variants in HEXA gene. Overall study detected 25 variants belonging to 31 affected TSD patients and 3 carrier couples confirmed by enzyme study. Of these 17 patients harbors 15 novel variants, including seven missense variants [p.V206L, p.Y213H, p.R252C, p.F257S, p.C328G, p.G454R, and p.P475R], four nonsense variant [p.S9X, p.E91X, p.W420X, and p.W482X], two splice site variants [c.347-1G>A and c.460-1G>A], and two small deletion [c.1349delC (p.A450VfsX3) and c.52delG (p.G18Dfs*82)]. While remaining 17 patients harbors 10 previously reported variants that includes six missense variants [p.M1T, p.R170Q, p.D322Y, p.D322N, p.E462V, and p.R499C], one nonsense variant [p.Q106X], two splice site variants [c.1073+1G>A and c.459+4A>G] and one 4 bp insertion [c.1278insTATC (p.Y427IfsX5)]. In conclusion, Indian infantile TSD patients provide newer insight into the molecular heterogeneity of the TSD. Combining present study and our earlier studies, we have observed that 67% genotypes found in Indian TSD patients are novel, which are associated with severe infantile phenotypes, while rest 33% genotypes found in our cohort were previously reported in various populations. In addition, higher frequency of the p.E462V and c.1278insTATC mutations in the present study further support and suggest the prevalence of p.E462V mutation in the Indian population.",0.05359044671058655,False
32295606,"BACKGROUND:The GM2 gangliosidoses (GM2), Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff diseases, are rare, autosomal recessive genetic disorders caused by mutations in the lysosomal enzyme β-hexosaminidase A (HEXA) or β-hexosaminidase B (HEXB) genes, respectively. A minority of patients have a late-onset form of disease that presents from late-childhood to adulthood and has a slowly progressive course with prolonged survival. Little research has been published documenting patient experiences with late-onset Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff diseases and how the disease impacts their daily lives and functioning. This study explored the most frequent symptoms and functional impacts experienced by patients with late-onset GM2 gangliosidosis through interviews with patients and caregivers. METHODS:A qualitative research study design was employed, using three focus groups and 18 one-on-one interviews with patients who were recruited at the National Tay-Sachs and Allied Diseases Annual Family Conference. Transcripts were generated from the discussions, and patient quotes were analyzed using a content analysis approach. Concepts were aggregated into symptom and functional impacts, and the frequency of mention in the focus groups and individual interviews was calculated. KEY FINDINGS:Many of the frequently described symptoms [muscle weakness (n = 19, 95%), ""clumsy"" gait (n = 12, 60%), fatigue (n = 10, 50%)] and impacts [difficulty walking (n = 19, 95%), falling (n = 17, 85%), and climbing stairs (n = 16, 80%)] disclosed by patients and caregivers were similar to those previously reported in the literature. However, less frequently described symptoms such as gastrointestinal issues (n = 4, 20%) and coughing fits (n = 5, 25%) have been expanded upon. This study evaluated the immediate impact of these symptoms on the patients' lives to highlight the burden of these symptoms and the functional limitations on daily living activities, independence, and emotional well-being. The findings were used to develop a conceptual disease model that could serve as a foundation for patient-centered outcomes in clinical trials and provide insights to the medical community that may benefit patient care. CONCLUSIONS:This study contributes to the current understanding of symptoms associated with late-onset GM2 gangliosidosis, and further identifies the many consequences and impacts of the disease. These symptoms and impacts could be measured in clinical trials to examine the effects of novel treatments from the patient perspective.",0.03524654358625412,False
31519716,Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) is a type 1 gangliosidosis (GM2) and caused by hexosaminidase A deficiency resulting in abnormal sphingolipid metabolism and deposition of precursors in different organs. It is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder transmitted in an autosomal-recessive manner. There is an accumulation of GM2 in neurocytes and retinal ganglions which result in progressive loss of neurological function and formation of the cherry-red spot which is the hallmark of TSD.

31896760,"The GM2-gangliosidoses are neurological diseases causing premature death, thus developing effective treatment protocols is urgent. GM2-gangliosidoses result from deficiency of a lysosomal enzyme β-hexosaminidase (Hex) and subsequent accumulation of GM2 gangliosides. Genetic changes in HEXA, encoding the Hex α subunit, or HEXB, encoding the Hex β subunit, causes Tay-Sachs disease and Sandhoff disease, respectively. Previous studies have showed that a modified human Hex µ subunit (HEXM) can treat both Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff diseases by forming a homodimer to degrade GM2 gangliosides. To this end, we applied this HEXM subunit in our PS813 gene editing system to treat neonatal Sandhoff mice. Through AAV delivery of the CRISPR system, a promoterless HEXM cDNA will be integrated into the albumin safe harbor locus, and lysosomal enzyme will be expressed and secreted from edited hepatocytes. 4 months after the i.v. of AAV vectors, plasma MUGS and MUG activities reached up to 144- and 17-fold of wild-type levels (n = 10, p < 0.0001), respectively. More importantly, MUGS and MUG activities in the brain also increased significantly compared with untreated Sandhoff mice (p < 0.001). Further, HPLC-MS/MS analysis showed that GM2 gangliosides in multiple tissues, except the brain, of treated mice were reduced to normal levels. Rotarod analysis showed that coordination and motor memory of treated mice were improved (p < 0.05). Histological analysis of H&E stained tissues showed reduced cellular vacuolation in the brain and liver of treated Sandhoff mice. These results demonstrate the potential of developing a treatment of in vivo genome editing for Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff patients.",0.027687085792422295,False
32529985,"Tay-Sachs disease (TSD), a deficiency of b-hexosaminidase A (Hex A), is a rare but debilitating hereditary metabolic disorder. Symptoms include extensive neurodegeneration and often result in death in infancy. We report an in silico study of 42 Hex A variants associated with the disease. Variants were separated into three groups according to the age of onset: infantile (n=28), juvenile (n=9) and adult (n=5). Protein stability, aggregation potential and the degree of conservation of residues were predicted using a range of in silico tools. We explored the relationship between these properties and the age of onset of TSD. There was no significant relationship between proteinstability and disease severity or between protein aggregation and disease severity. Infantile TSD had a significantly higher mean conservation score than nondisease associated variants. This was not seen in either juvenile or adult TSD. This study has established that the degree of residue conservation may be predictive of infantile TSD. It is possible that these more highly conserved residues are involved in trafficking of the protein to the lysosome. In addition, we developed and validated software tools to automate the process of in silico analysis of proteins involved in inherited metabolic diseases. Further work is required to identify the function of well-conserved residues to establish an in silico predictive model of TSD severity.",0.02660529315471649,False

30220252,"BACKGROUND:Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder caused by autosomal recessive mutations in the HEXA gene on chromosome 15 that encodes β-hexosaminidase. Deficiency in HEXA results in accumulation of GM2 ganglioside, a glycosphingolipid, in lysosomes. Currently, there is no effective treatment for TSD. RESULTS:We generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from two TSD patient dermal fibroblast lines and further differentiated them into neural stem cells (NSCs). The TSD neural stem cells exhibited a disease phenotype of lysosomal lipid accumulation. The Tay-Sachs disease NSCs were then used to evaluate the therapeutic effects of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with recombinant human Hex A protein and two small molecular compounds: hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPβCD) and δ-tocopherol. Using this disease model, we observed reduction of lipid accumulation by employing enzyme replacement therapy as well as by the use of HPβCD and δ-tocopherol. CONCLUSION:Our results demonstrate that the Tay-Sachs disease NSCs possess the characteristic phenotype to serve as a cell-based disease model for study of the disease pathogenesis and evaluation of drug efficacy.

30524313,"Tay-Sachs disease belongs to the group of autosomal-recessive lysosomal storage metabolic disorders. This disease is caused by β-hexosaminidase A (HexA) enzyme deficiency due to various mutations in α-subunit gene of this enzyme, resulting in GM2 ganglioside accumulation predominantly in lysosomes of nerve cells. Tay-Sachs disease is characterized by acute neurodegeneration preceded by activated microglia expansion, macrophage and astrocyte activation along with inflammatory mediator production. In most cases, the disease manifests itself during infancy, the ""infantile form,"" which characterizes the most severe disorders of the nervous system. The juvenile form, the symptoms of which appear in adolescence, and the most rare form with late onset of symptoms in adulthood are also described. The typical features of Tay-Sachs disease are muscle weakness, ataxia, speech, and mental disorders. Clinical symptom severity depends on residual HexA enzymatic activity associated with some mutations. Currently, Tay-Sachs disease treatment is based on symptom relief and, in case of the late-onset form, on the delay of progression. There are also clinical reports of substrate reduction therapy using miglustat and bone marrow or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. At the development stage there are methods of Tay-Sachs disease gene therapy using adeno- or adeno-associated viruses as vectors for the delivery of cDNA encoding α and β HexA subunit genes. Effectiveness of this approach is evaluated in α or β HexA subunit defective model mice or Jacob sheep, in which Tay-Sachs disease arises spontaneously and is characterized by the same pathological features as in humans. This review discusses the possibilities of new therapeutic strategies in Tay-Sachs disease therapy aimed at preventing neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation.",0.019468558952212334,False
30341570,"Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) is a lethal lysosomal storage disease (LSD) caused by mutations in the HexA gene, which can lead to deficiency of β-hexosaminidase A (HexA) activity and consequent accumulation of its substrate, GM2 ganglioside. Recent reports that progranulin (PGRN) functions as a chaperone of lysosomal enzymes and its deficiency is associated with LSDs, including Gaucher disease and neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, prompted us to screen the effects of recombinant PGRN on lysosomal storage in fibroblasts from 11 patients affected by various LSDs, which led to the isolation of TSD in which PGRN demonstrated the best effects in reducing lysosomal storage. Subsequent in vivo studies revealed significant GM2 accumulation and the existence of typical TSD cells containing zebra bodies in both aged and ovalbumin-challenged adult PGRN-deficient mice. In addition, HexA, but not HexB, was aggregated in PGRN-deficient cells. Furthermore, recombinant PGRN significantly reduced GM2 accumulation and lysosomal storage in these animal models. Mechanistic studies indicated that PGRN bound to HexA through granulins G and E domain and increased the enzymatic activity and lysosomal delivery of HexA. More importantly, Pcgin, an engineered PGRN derivative bearing the granulin E domain, also effectively bound to HexA and reduced the GM2 accumulation. Collectively, these studies not only provide new insights into the pathogenesis of TSD but may also have implications for developing PGRN-based therapy for this life-threatening disorder. KEY MESSAGES: GM2 accumulation and the existence of typical TSD cells containing zebra bodies are detected in both aged and ovalbumin-challenged adult PGRN deficient mice. Recombinant PGRN significantly reduces GM2 accumulation and lysosomal storage both in vivo and in vitro, which works through increasing the expression and lysosomal delivery of HexA.

30843643,"JScreen is a national public health initiative based out of Emory University that provides reproductive carrier screening through an online portal and follow-up genetic counseling services. In 2014, JScreen began reporting to patients variants of uncertain significance (VUSs) in the gene that causes Tay-Sachs disease (HEXA). Genetic counseling was provided to discuss the VUS and patients were offered hexosaminidase A (HEXA) blood enzyme testing to assist with VUS reclassification. To identify patient reactions and factors influencing their follow-up testing decisions after receiving these results, we conducted a retrospective quantitative study by administering online surveys to 62 patients with HEXA VUSs. Participants who pursued enzyme testing and those who did not both experienced low levels of distress when receiving the VUS results. Perceptions of HEXA carrier status after genetic counseling, decisional conflict levels, plans to have children in the near future, time available to pursue enzyme testing, and eligibility for research were significant factors influencing decision-making to pursue or not pursue enzyme testing. Genetic counseling played an important role in helping patients understand the VUS and follow-up testing options. When discussing VUSs with patients, it would be beneficial for genetic counselors to focus on the patient's perception of the VUS, anxiety related to the uncertainty of their results, and follow-up options, when available.",0.01689324900507927,False

31293106,"BACKGROUND:Pathogenic variants in HEXA that impair β-hexosaminidase A (Hex A) enzyme activity cause Tay-Sachs Disease (TSD), a severe autosomal-recessive neurodegenerative disorder. Hex A enzyme analysis demonstrates near-zero activity in patients affected with TSD and can also identify carriers, whose single functional copy of HEXA results in reduced enzyme activity relative to noncarriers. Although enzyme testing has been optimized and widely used for carrier screening in Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) individuals, it has unproven sensitivity and specificity in a pan-ethnic population. The ability to detect HEXA variants via DNA analysis has evolved from limited targeting of a few ethnicity-specific variants to next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the entire coding region coupled with interpretation of any discovered novel variants. METHODS:We combined results of enzyme testing, retrospective computational analysis, and variant reclassification to estimate the respective clinical performance of TSD screening via enzyme analysis and NGS. We maximized NGS accuracy by reclassifying variants of uncertain significance and compared to the maximum performance of enzyme analysis estimated by calculating ethnicity-specific frequencies of variants known to yield false-positive or false-negative enzyme results (e.g., pseudodeficiency and B1 alleles). RESULTS:In both AJ and non-AJ populations, the estimated clinical sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value were higher by NGS than by enzyme testing. The differences were significant for all comparisons except for AJ clinical sensitivity, where NGS exceeded enzyme testing, but not significantly. CONCLUSIONS:Our results suggest that performance of an NGS-based TSD carrier screen that interrogates the entire coding region and employs novel variant interpretation exceeds that of Hex A enzyme testing, warranting a reconsideration of existing guidelines.",0.011215069331228733,False
